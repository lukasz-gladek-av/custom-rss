                <p>A new controller from 8BitDo has been announced for smartphones, and this add-on will make your phone resemble a next-gen Game Boy. At CES 2026, 8BitDo showed off the FlipPad, a gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port. Details on the FlipPad are scarce for now, but 8BitDo says it will support both iOS and Android devices.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Where mobile play unfolds.<br>Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.<br>Compatible with iOS and Android devices.

The controller has a classic D-pad on the left and 12 face buttons, including the traditional four-button layout found on modern controllers. This could make the FlipPad ideal for retro-inspired games and emulators, and 8BitDo says it'll reveal more details ahead of its Summer 2026 release.</p><p>This isn't the company's first dive into smartphone controllers; it currently sells the Xbox-licensed 8BitDdo Ultimate Mobile controller for Android and iOS. Similar to its Ultimate controllers for PC and console, these smartphone controller cradles are officially licensed and offer an impressive amount of features for their budget-friendly price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png"></figure><p>These have Hall Effect sticks, face buttons, a retro-style D-pad, and contoured tactile handles. As you'd expect, you can also customize them through 8BitDo's software, and they fit smartphones measuring 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length. You can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white Xbox model</a> for $46 or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black version</a> for its standard price of $50.</p><p>It can connect wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, so you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. As for battery life, 8BitDo claims the 300 mAh battery can deliver up to 13 hours on a full charge.</p>

RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strange Man YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OSQPMaU7yz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues. The search is currently centered on a guitar symbol, and players are combing over Fort Wallace, since it's the closest location with guitars to the newly discovered symbol.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4J8LYqUi0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0T4J8LYqUi0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-passes-mario-kart-8-on-all-time-game-sales-list/1100-6536028/" data-ref-id="1100-6536028">Red Dead Redemption 2 passed Mario Kart 8</a> on the all-time list of video game best-sellers, with 79 million copies sold.

The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a> was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-new-modern-upgrade-shown-off-in-first-gameplay-footage/1100-6536618/" data-ref-id="1100-6536618">upgraded for modern consoles</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-new-version-launched-with-a-big-issue-on-xbox/1100-6536648/" data-ref-id="1100-6536648">Xbox users didn't automatically receive theirs</a> as planned.

                <p>Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. "I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave," dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, "Somebody help me."</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were "all good." Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Concerned neighbor attempts to break down door as player repeatedly shouts for 'help' during an 'ARC Raiders' game 😂<br>The player gave him a six-pack of beers for trying to help out<br>(via u/dreamthorp) <a href="https://t.co/6Qpufew4ID" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Qpufew4ID</a></p>  — Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Dreamthorp clarified in the comments that they were house-sitting for a friend when the incident happened. The door didn't break (and if it did, they said they would've bought their friend a new door), but dreamthorp figured that "one more kick and I’m pretty sure it would’ve busted." That's even with two deadbolts locked. After their heart nearly popped out of their chest because "the door bulged like an explosion was behind it," dreamthorp then unlocked the door, laughed with the supposed firefighter neighbor, and "dapped him up." They also dropped off a six-pack of Shiner Bock beers as a thank you for his natural instinct and quick action.</p><p>The commenters on dreamthorp's post were largely divided. Some found the moment very wholesome, calling the firefighter a "good dude" and a "real bro" for acting when someone might've been in need. (In a video game, that is.) Others questioned the veracity of dreamthorp's video, with folks wondering why it didn't show the firefighter neighbor actually kicking the door in.</p><p>Dreamthorp, who claimed to be a videographer in the comments, said corrupted files happen "all the time," especially when you turn off a camera while it's recording or pull out the SD card when transferring data. Regardless, dreamthorp purported that the two "scared the ever-living sh*t out of each other" in that moment.</p><p>Arc Raiders has found itself in the hot seat lately over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">its use of artificial intelligence</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">developer Embark Studios defending the controversial technology</a> because of the "tremendous benefits" it offers players and developers. Despite the criticism, the extraction shooter continues to be a smash success, reaching 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms.</p>
