                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity developer Larian has confirmed that it uses generative AI in its development processes, but not necessarily in the way you might think.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke said its developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. Vincke said, "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it." That said, Bloomberg reported that there has been "some pushback at Larian."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>He also confirmed that the new Divinity game will not have any AI-generated content in it. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," he said.</p><p>None of this is new or surprising, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">Vincke said many months ago that Larian was using machine learning systems for a variety of functions</a>, including "tasks that nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience," Vincke said of using machine learning to help generate new gameplay elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke, like many in the industry before him, also said he is aware of "red flags" pertaining to the use of generative AI in game development.</p><p>Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke also said the general population might not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Divinity game was announced at The Game Awards recently with a flashy--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">and super gross</a>--CGI trailer. The game has no release date as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, be sure to read GameSpot's own new interview with Vincke, in which he claims that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">the new Divinity game will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts."</a></p>

                <p>Infinity Ward, the developer of the popular Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, has told fans, "Don't believe everything you read on the internet" amid a rumor about next year's game.</p><p>In a post on social media, the studio wished fans a happy holiday and teased that it's "looking forward to talking soon." In the meantime, the developer said fans should be wary of what they read on the internet. Although there was no further context provided, this may be a reference to a recent report that claimed Infinity Ward is making 2026's Call of Duty game, rumored to be Modern Warfare 4, and that its multiplayer would be a "complete copy" of Modern Warfare 2's.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Happy holidays everybody!</p><p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon.</p><p>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

This has yet to be confirmed, but Infinity Ward's latest social media post ended with, "See you in 2026."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the newest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">reportedly sold worse than 2024's Black Ops 6</a>.

                <p>Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft.

The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle."</p><p>"We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said.</p><p>Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs."</p><p>March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles.</p><p>The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cuts-hit-video-game-division-reducing-work-on-mmos/1100-6535769/" data-ref-id="1100-6535769">Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company</a>, including at its gaming division.

                <p>Pedro "Flute Guy" Eustache has become one of The Game Awards most-beloved returning figures, known for playing his outlandish collection of flutes with incredible passion and panache. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-keeps-the-legend-of-flute-guy-strong/1100-6536923/" data-ref-id="1100-6536923">another stellar performance</a> at The Game Awards 2025, Eustache has taken to social media to show off all the different instruments he played in this year's show.</p><p>While Eustache's stage presence is the main element that has made him so popular with viewers of The Game Awards, his unusual collection of instruments has also tickled the internet's fancy over the years he's been a part of The Game Awards Orchestra. This year, he has named all the different instruments he played in the famous Game of the Year medley, which include a handful of curiously custom-made or customized instruments.</p><p>Showing them off in the order they were played during the medley, Eustache's first two instruments are western concert flutes with swapped-out headpieces--the first from a traditional Armenian shvi, and the second a 3D-printed head based on the Armenian blul. Eustache also demonstrates the strange flute he played during the Clair Obscur section of the medley, simply calling it a "PVC-based flute." <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999518701444337802" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Geoff Keighley revealed</a> after the show that Eustache built this instrument just for TGAs.</p><p>The next flute is another traditional folk instrument, this time a Chinese dizi. The medley is finished with two western flutes, the bass flute, and the huge contrabass flute--the former being the instrument Eustache first went viral with during his enthusiastic performance in the 2022 Game of the Year medley.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm elated that you were unto our GOTY TGA 2025 performance.<br>YES you got it: the Thumb-size-Ocarina wasn't on my last video!<br>Thanks to @geoffkighley &amp; @lornebafle &amp; to God, for His awesome grace!<br>Stay tuned: many more great projects coming up soon!<br>God bless you all! <a href="https://t.co/CfF87T9IRR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/CfF87T9IRR</a></p>  — Pedro Eustache (@EustachePedro) <a href="https://twitter.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a follow-up video, Eustache revealed that he had omitted one instrument that made an appearance at the 2025 awards ceremony--the thumb-sized ocarina played for Donkey Kong Bananza. He finishes by thanking "gamers of the world" for their support, promising he will indeed be back for The Game Awards 2026.</p><p>Outside of Flute Guy and the TGA orchestra's incredible performances, this year's awards show was dominated by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which took home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-breaking 13 nominations and nine award wins</a>, including Game of the Year.

                <p>In November, a modder going by the name Froddoyo released Project Misriah, which used Valve's Counter-Strike 2 as a medium to recreate Halo 3. The mod was well-received by fans, but apparently not by Microsoft itself. Microsoft filed a takedown request with Valve, and the latter complied.</p><p>Froddoyo described Project Misriah as "a workshop collection of Halo ported maps and assets that aims to bring a Halo 3 multiplayer-like experience to Counter-Strike 2." It also directly lifted character models, maps, gameplay mechanics, and sound effects from Halo 3, which may have contributed to Microsoft's desire to have the mod removed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki1RQF0-jyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ki1RQF0-jyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Froddoyo shared the takedown on X, and wrote, "It was fun while it lasted. Make sure to give your thanks to Microsoft!"</p><p>In a separate comment posted on the trailer's YouTube page, Froddoyo thanked players for supporting the mod but noted that it will not uploaded again. In a more hopeful message, Froddoyo added, "We will use the knowledge and skills obtained from this to cook up something else!"</p><p>It's unclear if Microsoft has any plans to revisit Halo 3 or any of the other classic games in the franchise beyond the first one. The original Halo: Combat Evolved is getting a modern remake called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, which will celebrate the 25th anniversary of the franchise while launching simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026. There are reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinites-last-update-arrives-this-month-as-devs-move-to-other-halo-projects/1100-6536070/" data-ref-id="1100-6536070">other unannounced Halo games</a> currently in the works, but it's unclear what Halo Studios will release after Campaign Evolved.</p>

Also similar to Silksong, all players who already own the Nintendo Switch version of Hollow Knight will get the Switch 2 Edition for free when it launches.</p>

      </div>
<p>In preparation for the Switch 2 upgrade, Hollow Knight is going to get a major update across all platforms, which will serve to add new features and patch up bugs in the game. Players on PC will be able to preview some of these upgrades in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/367520/discussions/0/705506553887849293/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new public beta branch</a> for Hollow Knight, available to test through Steam or GOG. The beta update includes official support for people playing on Steam Deck or ultrawide monitors, with full 16:10 and 21:9 aspect ratio support.</p><p>Team Cherry hasn't shared a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition, only saying that it will arrive sometime in 2026. The studio has also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-getting-a-free-nautical-themed-expansion/1100-6536988/" data-ref-id="1100-6536988">a new free expansion for Silksong</a>, Sea of Sorrow, which is also scheduled to release in 2026.</p><p>It's been a big year for the Australian indie studio, with the surprise release of Hollow Knight: Silksong in September after an extended seven-year development period. Silksong took home the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">award for Best Action Adventure Game at The Game Awards 2025</a>, and was included as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2025/2900-7322/" data-ref-id="2900-7322">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2025</a>.</p>

The nautical-themed Sea of Sorrow expansion will arrive sometime in 2026, and will be free for all players.</p><p>Team Cherry released a brief teaser trailer for Sea of Sorrow but hasn't revealed many details about the upcoming expansion other than that it will include new areas, bosses, tools, and more. The trailer description teased that players will be able to "voyage across and beneath the salt-stricken seas" when Sea of Sorrow arrives next year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c77QBk4Gc6w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c77QBk4Gc6w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Based on the small vignettes shown in the trailer, it seems likely that Sea of Sorrow will be set in Pharloom Bay, a seaside area featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-reveal-trailer/2300-6448356/" data-ref-id="2300-6448356">Silksong's reveal trailer</a> that was cut from the final game. One of the images in the new teaser specifically seems to resemble The Lab, a location within Pharloom Bay that appeared in concept sketches and early game maps, as compiled on the <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Cut_Content_(Silksong)/Areas#Pharloom_Bay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight Wiki</a>.</p><p>Team Cherry hasn't said when in 2026 it expects to release the Sea of Sorrow expansion--though the teaser's YouTube comments are full of jokes that the indie studio is going to end up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/" data-ref-id="1100-6534218">spending seven years on it</a> and releasing it as a standalone game. The studio once again isn't planning on giving incremental updates during development, saying that they will be releasing more information on Sea of Sorrow "shortly before" release.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After a lot of back and forth on the internet regarding what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/" data-ref-id="1100-6536779">Geoff Keighley’s demonic obelisk</a> could mean, it was finally revealed at The Game Awards that the statue was related to Divinity, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/divinity-official-larian-studios-teaser-trailer-with-full-intro-from-the-game-awards-2025/2300-6466578/" data-ref-id="2300-6466578">the next game from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios</a>. Shortly after that reveal, we at GameSpot received an email asking if we would like to go sit with game director Swen Vincke and writing director Adam Smith to talk about the game once the show concluded.</p><p dir="ltr">Post-TGA plans sorted.</p><p dir="ltr">Returning to Divinity was always, eventually, in the cards for the team at Larian, but it wasn’t the original plan following Baldur’s Gate 3. “ We were gonna do more Dungeons and Dragons, so we were in the process of figuring out what that was,” says Smith. “And one fateful day, we sat down and realized that we weren't excited and we don't wanna make a game we're not excited about. And so we said, ‘Can we go back to Divinity right away?’”</p><p dir="ltr">In order to do that, the team knew that they had a lot of work ahead of them. While Rivellon, the setting of the Divinity games, has been deeply explored in previous entries, Larian had never actually sat down to build their universe from the ground up before.</p><p dir="ltr">“We learned from BG3 the importance of having a ruleset, allure, and a world solidified behind you,” says Vincke. “It was quite a lot of work actually. [Now] we know what the days of the week are. We know what people eat in the evening. We know the way they dress. All these things needed to be sorted out. So as progress grew, we started saying, ‘Okay, well this is a really good cornerstone for everything that we've built. And there's never been a real Divinity, so let's just call it Divinity. People will henceforth refer to it as the Divinity Universe quickly and like it.’”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623334"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623334-trailer-screenshots_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both Divinity and Baldur’s Gate 3 share a lot of connective tissue; rich, fantasy worlds filled with magic and a diverse roster of races. However, when it comes to gameplay, the two are quite different. While the Original Sin duology bears somewhat of a resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3, previous installments prior to those games have looked more like titles such as Diablo and The Witcher. So what should players expect from this new Divinity? “Agency,” says Vincke plainly. “Agency at every level. In the systems and how you can develop your character, your identity, and then also obviously in the narrative and the choices that you make.”</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke then points out how dark the trailer for the game that premiered at the TGAs is. “ We have this thing that the player will be the one that brings light into the darkness or pushes it completely into deeper darkness,” says Vincke. “ We want you to be surprised at the level of things that you can do.”</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for more granular details on the gameplay, Smith adds that the team wants the game to speak for itself when it's ready to be shown. “You don't want to be told, 'This is what it's gonna do.' You want to see it,” says Smith. “You know the kind of games we make, so you can speculate from there. But we'll put it in front of you as soon as we're ready to, and then you'll see what it is.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623335"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623335-trailer-screenshots_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Divinity is likely to be the first game in the series that many players will experience thanks to the immense popularity of Baldur’s Gate 3, the team is making sure that existing fans of the franchise also feel it to be a continuation of what has come before. “We ensure that that continuity is present. If you didn't know it, you will [still] fully understand everything that's going on,” says Vincke.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke explains that it will be akin to how Baldur’s Gate 3 had plenty of continuity with the previous games in the series but didn't require you to have played Baldur’s Gate 1 and 2 to understand it. He also points out that the Original Sin installments sold over 10 million copies, and therefore, there should be a large returning player-base in addition to those coming from BG3 as their first Larian title.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it’s easy to see how the success of Baldur’s Gate 3 might put enormous pressure on the development of Divinity to live up to player expectations. However, it’s not something that the team at Larian is concerning themselves with, as Smith points toward how much space there is left in the RPG genre to iterate and innovate. “Clair Obscur is so different to us and they nailed it, right? I think they did something very similar to us in that they made the game they wanted to make, [but] they did it in a completely different way [with] a completely different skeleton,” says Smith.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336" data-ratio="0.42604166666667" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623336"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4623336-trailer-screenshots_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite feeling that Divinity doesn’t need to compete with Baldur’s Gate 3, Vincke is very confident that their new game is a step up from their previous outing. “ It's going to be better, in my opinion, on all fronts,” says Vincke. “ One of the biggest struggles that we had with Baldur’s Gate 3 is every single class has almost different rulesets, so getting players on board with that was quite complicated. I'm surprised actually that it worked out that well. I think when you see what we can do when we make something for a video game that’s not derived from a tabletop, it's going to be a lot better.”</p><p dir="ltr">For those that want to get a taste of what Divinity may have to offer, the previous installment in the franchise, Original Sin 2, just launched on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
