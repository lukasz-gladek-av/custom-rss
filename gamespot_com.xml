                <p>Capcom will air a Capcom Spotlight livestream on Thursday, June 26, featuring a selection of its upcoming games, along with updates for ongoing games, like Monster Hunter Wilds. The showcase is set to feature some of Capcom's biggest upcoming titles, including the recently announced Resident Evil Requiem.</p><p>Capcom has laid out the four games it plans to show, and while there is always a chance of a surprise, Capcom Spotlights don't usually feature any major new game announcements. Here's everything you need to know to tune in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to watch the Capcom Spotlight</h2><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CapcomUSA_/status/1935506173899268341" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Thursday, June 26, 3pm PT for a 40-minute Capcom Spotlight livestream!

You can also watch the stream on GameSpot's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamespot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channel.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Capcom Spotlight start time</h2><p dir="ltr">The Capcom Spotlight starts at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET on Thursday. Capcom has said the livestream will last about 40 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the start times for different time zones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">8 AM (June 27)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">While there is always a small chance for surprises, Capcom has announced the four games that will be featured in the livestream. Those games are Monster Hunter Wilds, Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>, and now Capcom is planning to show off more of it during the stream. Some outlets, including GameSpot, got to see an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/">extended demo of Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which could be shown here to the public. It's also possible that Capcom has even more to show, since Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 26, 2026</p><p dir="ltr">Pragmata got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest along with a 2026 release window. GameSpot played a hands-on demo of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-juggling-gunplay-and-puzzles-gets-surprisingly-tense/1100-6532386/">puzzle-shooter</a> at Summer Games Fest, and it seems possible Capcom could show off more gameplay here. Considering Pragmata got its 2026 release window just a few weeks ago, it seems unlikely that a more specific date will be announced during the Capcom Spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/">overwhelmingly negative reviews</a> on Steam due to ongoing performance issues, will likely see announcements of new content updates, including potential upcoming events or new monsters. While there will most likely be a Monster Hunter Wilds expansion announced at some point in the future, it is probably too soon for that to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom recently announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-sagat-c-viper-and-two-more-characters/1100-6532220/" data-ref-id="1100-6532220">DLC fighters coming in Year 3</a> of Street Fighter 6--Sagat, C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex--but Sagat, the first character to be released, doesn't have a release date just yet. There will likely also be other updates, like new cosmetics and perhaps a showcase of the new fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">With the showcase running for about 40 minutes, it seems like there won't be much time for additional announcements. However, Capcom has unveiled a classic game collection or two at past showcases, so never say never.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">GameSpot's two-day visit to the museum in 2024</a>, Dan Ryckert noted that it "is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum." He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise. In response to demand from around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-museum-puts-limits-on-gift-store-merch-to-discourage-scalpers/1100-6526911/" data-ref-id="1100-6526911">Nintendo Museum added limits to the merch that visitors can buy</a> in order to discourage scalpers. The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>

                <p>Actor Jack Black had a role in 2020's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2, and he's coming back in Pro Skater 3 + 4 to reprise that character and pull double duty by voicing another one as well.</p><p>Black will play Officer "Dick <em>and </em>Dick's UK-born twin, Constable Richard. Both characters are villains, of sorts, meant to represent "the man" trying to ruin everyone's fun by enforcing rules.</p><p>Richard Ennvee (see what they did there?) was mocked in his childhood for being a "poser," so he vowed to get revenge by becoming "the long arm of the law," according to Activision.</p><p>Game director Kurt Tillmanns told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/jack-black-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-officer-dick-1236440201/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that Activision wanted to carry the character forward to Pro Skater 3 + 4 and "tell a little bit more" of his story, while also expanding things to tell the story of his UK twin. For Constable Richard, Black does a British accent and appears in the London level. Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at Black's two characters.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l181WSin3g4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l181WSin3g4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other news, Tony Hawk himself has partnered with Taco Bell to create his own special luxe box that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/taco-bell-themed-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-dlc-is-coming-and-we-hope-youre-hungry/1100-6532708/" data-ref-id="1100-6532708">DLC codes for Pro Skater 3 + 4 in-game items. </a></p><p>Pro Skater 3 + 4 releases on July 11, and as an Activision game, it's coming to Xbox Game Pass at launch.
