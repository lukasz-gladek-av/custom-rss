While Black Desert Online is an MMORPG--rather than a single-player action RPG like Crimson Desert--both games share similar fast-paced battles and high fantasy worlds. Black Desert is one of the most popular MMORPGs on the market, offering a massive world to explore, frantic action-based combat, and gorgeous graphical fidelity. The base game is just $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582660/Black_Desert/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but it's important to note Black Desert is designed around microtransactions and other in-app purchases (something that Crimson Desert will seemingly not be burdened with). Nevertheless, if you're sticking to the basic gameplay and character apparel, it should be a cheap way to stay busy until March.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X In Stock At Best Buy On Launch Day, Ships Immediately</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle-buying-guide/1100-6533331/">Pokemon Nintendo Switch 2 Console Bundle Restocked At Amazon On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-soundwave-bumblebee-2-in-1-building-sets/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Bumblebee Gets First Solid Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals/1100-6535432/">Two Xenoblade Chronicles Games Get Rare Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Booster Box Is Only $140 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-by-alan-lee-deluxe-book-box-set-amazon-walmart-deals/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Box Set Is Still On Sale For Only $108</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Guide - Target Reveals Exclusive Launch Bonus</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>There's no shortage of retro handhelds and consoles with Atari's branding, but the newest flagship device from My Arcade aims to offer the definitive portable experience. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT68G1TP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Gamestation Go</a></strong> is a 7-inch handheld with over 200 games and a few unique control methods, including a paddle, trak-ball, and even a numeric keypad. Retro enthusiasts interested in the Gamestation Go may want to secure one soon. Preorders for the $180 portable are sold out on Atari's website, but you can still snag one from Amazon ahead of its October 31 launch.</p><p>The Atari Gamestation Go releases the same day as the the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/" data-ref-id="1100-6533716">Pac-Man Edition of the cartridge-based Atari 2600+</a>.

On the left side of the handheld, you'll find a D-pad, trak-ball, and integrated paddle. Below the four face buttons on the right side is a 12-button numeric keypad with 0-9 as well as the number sign and asterisk. It also has four shoulder buttons.</p><p>Atari 8-bit and 16-bit games made use of a variety of controllers, and the Gamestation Go looks to offer the most comprehensive experience yet in a handheld form factor. One interesting feature is called SmartGlow, which illuminates the controls for each game you boot up.</p><p>The built-in game library includes a wide range of arcade and console games from the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, and Atari Arcade. Notable publisher partnerships include Bandai Namco (Pac-Man), Jaleco, and Piko Interactive. It also comes with the modernized "Recharged" versions of five classics, including Asteroids and Centipede. Another highlight is Balls of Steel, a pinball game with seven different tables. The full list of games can be found on Amazon's store page.</p><p>The Gamestation Go's built-in 7-inch display looks nice in promotional videos and images, but if you want the home console experience, you can connect the included HDMI cable to your TV or monitor to game on a big screen.</p><p>It's unclear exactly which controllers will work with the Gamestation Go, but the handheld has a pair of USB-C ports on the back for multiplayer. We know My Arcade is making an official controller and joystick, but we'd expect the Gamestation Go to support other controllers similar to the Game Station Pro home console.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro" data-collection="" title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$80 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Atari Gamestation Pro is My Arcade's dedicated home console.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> wastes no time drawing you in. Set amid the beauty of feudal Ezo, its tale of revenge soon gives way to something deeper--a journey of healing and reflection for its protagonist, Atsu.</p><p>Revenge and grief are still powerful motivators in the game, and these are grim themes that PlayStation gamers might be familiar with, thanks to titles like The Last of Us Part 2 and God of War Ragnarok. So what is it about the cycle of violence and anguish that makes it so appealing to developers, who have all put their own stamps on these ideas?</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Ghost of Yotei lead writer Ian Ryan and creative director Jason Connell explained how Atsu's quest might have started with revenge in mind, but over the course of the game, evolved into something greater.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH3Efr6OOk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BIH3Efr6OOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>"It's about healing--revenge just sets it off"</h2><p>"I feel like there are a lot of different types of games--that even within Sony--that don't touch revenge at all, but there are some that are about revenge," Connell said. "I can't really speak to why they do it, but I will say some of the reasons why we chose it, and I think some of those will have overlap and I bet some of them won't have any at all. So, for example, it's hard to imagine that any other Sony game has been looking at a bunch of samurai films with revenge [themes] and decided that it was something that they were inspired by. But I could imagine that the second reason, we were going for a game that was going to be very open, a lot of freedom."</p><p>"I've seen people play 40 or 50 hours and haven't gotten to the second Yotei Six member. That is by design. Like we've made the game to be this way, but that really meant that we needed a very simple narrative hook that could get you, propel you into Atsu's journey, and some people are just going to go do it and find out it's a lot more than that. It's about healing--revenge just sets it off. And the people that don't, like, at least you understand that it's not like a hyper-complex thing to understand early on.</p><p>"And I do imagine that it can probably be appealing to storytellers, because storytelling is hard enough as it is, but you put it inside of a giant video game. Both progression, open-world exploration, and all these other competing elements can be really challenging. So the simplicity of it is really beautiful, and I think there's probably something that's very attractive to creators."</p><h2>"We wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player"</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726"></a><figcaption>Ezo is a land of unrivaled beauty in Ghost of Yotei.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg"></figure><p>Ryan added that themes of revenge were useful in that they allowed players to hit the ground running, keeping them engaged from the very start of the game. "It's similar in that as we're approaching the story and we know it's going to be so wide, that we just want the player to be able to keep that, track that in their head, and, and not lose sight of that kind of overriding objective and emotional core to what Atsu is going through, even as she's following the golden bird to do any number of of side stories," Ryan said.</p><p>"We also wanted a smaller opening overall so that players could engage in the gameplay and get to the open world early. And part of that means also that we wanted to players to lock into and relate to that core overriding goal. It is just such a visceral, human desire that does have deep roots everywhere."</p><p>"Everyone can relate to it--just to varying degrees--and so we wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player and create that connection with Atsu, that they could carry it out into the open world even if they decided not to engage in the revenge quest for 30 hours, because ultimately going off and doing other things is a form of healing and not getting into that obsession."</p><p>Connell and Ryan had lots more to say about the game, and if you're interested in exploring just how the memorable roster of villains--the Yotei Six led by Lord Saito--helped shape the game, you can watch the video above for fascinating insight on Ghost of Yotei's development.</p><p>"Ghost of Yotei is shaped by Atsu, its new protagonist, as you're propelled on a gripping tale of revenge amidst the backdrop of Feudal Japan's contrasting beauty and violence," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.</p>

Not every home is going to be created equal, but there's a way to get a leg up on your fellow players so you'll have a house full of furniture when the feature launches in early-access on December 2 for those who preorder Midnight.</p><p>Players can earn furniture by completing achievements, and it's all going to be awarded retroactively if you've already finished the ones you need. The full list of housing-related achievements was revealed on WoW's Public Test Realm, and now there's an add-on called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/home-bound" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Home Bound</a> that makes it easier for everyone to see what they have to earn.</p><p>The add-on was created by a player called Bettiold, and it lays out over 100 different items--complete with 3D decor images--that can be earned by in-game achievements. Players can even filter out achievements they've already achieved to focus on the ones that they want.</p><p>To use the Home Bound add-on, download the file from CurseForge and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Install Home Bound.</li><li>Once the game starts, type "/hb" or "/homebound" in chat.</li></ol><p>From there, players can browse achievements by category. Blizzard has previously revealed that there will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">be neighborhood-wide events</a> called Endeavors, which will allow players to work together towards a common purpose and reap the rewards for cooperation.</p><p>The Midnight expansion is also doing away with combat add-ons, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">caused some concern among players</a> because the alpha build rendered nearly every piece of combat information invisible to add-ons without giving them a viable alternative.</p>

Some problems could block your progress in select missions permanently, but there's a new patch that has addressed many of these random occurrences, so you can keep clashing steel and hunting the Yotei Six without a hitch.</p><p>The team <a href="https://support.suckerpunch.com/hc/en-us/articles/42237189337499-Patch-1-010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped the patch notes for Update 1.010</a> on Sucker Punch Productions' official website. The patch stabilizes the game by fixing two rare crashes as well as swapping out placeholder assets during a major story beat. But those are somewhat small potatoes when compared to the myriad gameplay tweaks that make the game even more playable than it already is on PS5.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Which Ghost of Yotei Mode Should You Play?</p>
      </div>
<p>For instance, your progress could be blocked during "The Way of the Kusarigama" mission if you warped into it at a specific point. Or your progress could be halted if you ignored the "armor upgrade" scene and left the area during "The Tale of the Oni" mission. Heck, your progress could be barred if you created a campsite in mission-critical stealth grass during "The Kusarigama’s Shame," didn't have flash bombs during the "Fighting Fire with Fire" mission, or--and this is very specific--saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito's goons during the "Higashi Lumberyard" mission. There are more, but you get it.</p><p>In short, many of these very random and very specific "permanent mission blocking" bugs have been ironed out. Now, nothing is stopping you from getting your revenge on that dastardly Lord Saito and his cronies.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei--which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">a 9/10 in GameSpot's "superb" review</a>--is available now for PlayStation 5.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei Update 1.010 Patch Notes</h2><h4>Performance and Stability</h4><ul><li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen when ray tracing is enabled.</li><li>Fixed a rare crash that could occur during “Poison and Lies” if the player backtracked to the fire in the building then walked towards Oyuki with the Nine Tails NPC following Atsu.</li></ul><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Black Ghost mask from being granted to players who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yotei once they completed “To Catch a Spider”.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Fighting Fire with Fire” due to the player not being guaranteed to have flash bombs during the flash bomb trainer.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Way of the Kusarigama” if the player warped into the mission during a specific point.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Tale of the Oni” if the player managed to avoid seeing the “armor upgrade” scene and then left the area.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “A Brokered Trust” if the player managed to complete part of the branching objectives and then goes and completes a different mission allowing the second branch to become available.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Higashi Lumberyard” if the player saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito’s soldiers.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Broken Horn Garrison” if the player died after killing all enemies and rescuing the prisoner but before the final conversation plays.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Kusarigama’s Shame” if the player created a campsite in mission critical stealth grass.</li><li>Fixed a permanent game blocking bug that could happen if the player climbed a tower in the Frontier, talked to an NPC, but then restarted from their last checkpoint.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could happen in “Encounters of the Wild” that would cause the fox to appear stuck if the player had reloaded their game after seeing the bear above the cave near the sanctuary.</li><li>Fixed a bug that would allow the player to change their loadout during the spar with Kiku in “A Wolf’s Pack”.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the player could become stuck in a permanent respawn loop if they jumped into a pit and died soon after completing an objective or mission.</li></ul><h4>Environment</h4><ul><li>Replaced a placeholder asset that had been along a major path in “The Kitsune’s Fate”.</li></ul>
