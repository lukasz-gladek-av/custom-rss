It’s also one of the most expensive--clocking in at $1,300, it’s a huge investment. However, ahead of the holidays, Samsung is slashing its price to $900 and bundling in a free 2TB 990 Pro SSD. That makes this one of the best times to upgrade your setup, though it's unclear how much longer the deal will stick around.</p><div title="6528546 - Samsung 49-Inch Monitor Plus 2TB SSD" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3012" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6528546 - Samsung 49-Inch Monitor Plus 2TB SSD" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value">Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey OLED Gaming Monitor with Free 2TB 990 Pro SSD</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value">$900 (was $1,300) | The free SSD is valued at $180 (was $265)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Featuring a 49-inch OLED curved display, a 5120 x 1440p resolution, and an impressive 0.03ms response time, the Odyssey OLED G9 is the ideal companion for gaming. Coupled with its 144Hz refresh rate and support for HDMI 2.1, Micro HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C, and you’ve got an easy way to connect all your devices to the sprawling monitor. The stand is also fairly adjustable, allowing you to find the best viewing angle for your home. Samsung offers a three-year warranty with your purchase.</p><p>Along with the monitor, <strong>Samsung is tossing in its 2TB 990 Pro NVMe SSD with a heatsink for free</strong>. This is what makes this deal so good. This model M.2 SSD retails for $265, though it's currently selling for <a href="https://howl.link/3obwz0bvdjqj6?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$180 at Samsung</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Expansion-Compatible-Playstation5-MZ-V9P2T0CW/dp/B0BHJDY57J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>. The 990 Pro is a superb high-end SSD for PC, and it's one of the best SSDs you can buy for PS5. Since it has a heatsink preinstalled, it's PS5-ready out of the box. The 990 Pro has sequential read and write speeds of 7,450MB/s and 6,900 MB/s, respectively--well above the PS5's requirements and perfect for high-end PCs.</p><p>990 Pro 4.0 NVMe SSD 2TB with Heatsink. Regularly priced at $265, that makes this deal all the more enticing, especially if you’re looking to upgrade your PC or PS5 (the SSD is fully compatible with Sony’s console).</p></div>                      </div><p>While the above Samsung Odyssey G9 is arguably the best deal on the manufacturer's 49-inch panels, it's not the only one to consider.</p><p>The newer <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Adjustable-LS49CG932SNXZA/dp/B0CDQMQQS2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey OLED G9 Curved Monitor</a> is discounted to $950 (was $1,600) at Amazon and offers a faster 240Hz refresh rate. Give it a look if you don’t mind spending an extra $50 and won’t miss out on the free SSD.</p><p>Stepping away from OLED products, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG950ENXZA/dp/B0DHJBWY52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 49-Inch Odyssey G9</a> is on sale for $770 (was $1,000). Along with lacking an OLED display, it also lacks the 0.03ms response time of the two above monitors, instead featuring a 1ms response time. You’ll still get a 240Hz refresh rate--and at $770, it’s worth considering if you don't need the SSD.</p><h2>Samsung Odyssey G9 49" Gaming Monitor Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/0t5w43qsoea36?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G91SD OLED Curved (49-inch, 144Hz) + 2TB 990 Pro SSD with heatsink</a> -- $900 (<del>$1,300</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-Adjustable-LS49CG932SNXZA/dp/B0CDQMQQS2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G93SC OLED Curved (49-inch, 240Hz)</a> -- $950 (<del>$1,600</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Odyssey-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG950ENXZA/dp/B0DHJBWY52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G95C 1440p Curved (49-inch, 240Hz)</a> -- $770 (<del>$1,000</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazios-massive-official-strategy-guide-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6528507/">Metaphor: ReFantazio Is Getting A Nearly 600-Page Official Strategy Guide</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-strategy-guides-finally-restocked-at-amazon-get-all-three-while-you-can/1100-6524739/">Elden Ring Strategy Guides Finally Restocked At Amazon - Get All Three While You Can</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-elite-series-2-controller-discounted-to-124-at-walmart-and-amazon-lowest-price-ever-at-both/1100-6528306/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Best-Ever Price At Walmart And Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/akira-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-edition-revealed-preorder-the-anime-classic-at-amazon/1100-6528513/">Akira 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Revealed - Preorder The Anime Classic At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-has-two-super-mario-bros-movie-4k-steelbooks-in-stock-for-28-each/1100-6528298/">Walmart Has Two Super Mario Bros.

Steam Replay includes all of your playtime between January 1 to December 14, and doesn't include any playtime played in offline mode or when disconnected from the internet.</p><p>The tool offers a bunch of different stats, including how many games you played this year, how many Steam Achievements you've unlocked, and your longest playing streak calculated by days. It also shows your favorite genres, which of your games took up the highest percentage of overall playtime, and how much time you spent between different platforms such as Windows PC and Steam Deck.</p><p>There's a timeline that shows which games you've played each month and compares your stats to the average Steam user's median. For example, the median number of achievements unlocked this year was 13 and the median number of games played is 4.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-check-out-your-playstation-2024-wrap-up/1100-6528359/" data-ref-id="1100-6528359">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-year-in-review-2024-unlocked-shows-your-most-played-game-and-busiest-month/1100-6528235/" data-ref-id="1100-6528235">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-year-in-review-for-2024-is-available-now-get-a-free-2025-calendar/1100-6528550/" data-ref-id="1100-6528550">Nintendo</a> have already released their own 2024 year-in-review tools.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> may be out now, but the PS5 itself remains a popular gift this holiday season. A PS5 was even seemingly given to one young fan attending a Hornets game at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina earlier this week. The NBA team brought the kid out to the court and pretended to give him a PS5 for Christmas before quickly taking it back after the cameras cut away.</p><p>The giveaway was captured on social media by Adam Turner, who shared the video below. Turner also said the Hornets only gave the kid a jersey after taking back the PS5.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You guys want to see a cheap sports organization?<br>In this video my best friend&amp;his nephew get called onto court for a special segment where they gift the kid a PS5 publicly… w/cameras off they TOOK IT AWAY and gave him a jersey.<br>😂 Take a bow <a href="https://twitter.com/hornets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@hornets</a>… crushed the kid <a href="https://t.co/mcj5hhsuM5" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/mcj5hhsuM5</a></p>  — USMNT_STAN (@StanUsmnt) <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1868854508102803654?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This caused such an uproar that the Hornets subsequently issued an apology that claimed the giveaway was meant to be an on-court skit. The Hornets went on to say that the team has reached out to the family of the boy to offer him a PS5 and a VIP experience at a future home game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/hornets-apologize-after-pretending-to-give-child-ps5-and-taking-it-away-off-camera-230954440.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yahoo Sports</a>, the boy's uncle was informed ahead of time that he wouldn't be keeping the PS5, but apparently no one told the child. The story quickly picked up steam nationally and in the local press before the Hornets reversed course. Turner <a href="https://twitter.com/StanUsmnt/status/1869243676637217209" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subsequently wrote</a>, "Credit to Hornets for making it right [and] taking immediate action. Owning mistakes is a great thing and often organizations try to cover their tracks."</p><p>Until last year, NBA legend Michael Jordan was the controlling owner of the Hornets before selling the majority of his stake to a new ownership team.</p>
