Krakoa's other half, Arakko, settled on the red planet alongside a large population of mutants. However, Ultron has greatly changed Arakko in Marvel Rivals. According to the story update, Ultron has stolen the X-Men's Cerebro unit to become X-Tron, and transformed Arakko into "a cold, merciless mechanical world." To restore Arakko to its former glory, Marvel's heroes will have to unite once again.</p><p>NetEase Games is also making some adjustments to Marvel Rivals' team-up abilities by removing four abilities and adding six new ones. Additionally, Jeff the Land Shark is getting a Jeff-nado team-up ability. Marvel Rivals will also unveil proficiency avatars on the match hero select wheel, including mood and emojis personalization systems.</p><p>On June 6, Marvel Rivals will launch Ultron's Battle Matrix, a limited-time experimental mode. In the battle matrix, players will be able pick their own hero lineups and create unique builds that enhance their characters' abilities.

<p>"I realized that I would need the resolve to see it through to completion or see it through to the end," he explained.</p><p>As for the advice that Miyazaki gave him, Ishizaki said Miyazaki and other directors at From Software informed him that he "shouldn't hold back."</p><p>"So, on the day-to-day process of making games, something that maybe I would've given a pass to would not get through so easily as director," he said. "I'd have to be a bit more critical, put a bit more discipline on myself to really take a good look at these things and decide the best way forward for the whole project."</p><p>Nightreign is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike</a>-ish spin-off developed by From Software, taking players to Limveld where they will square off against a range of new enemies.

                <p>2017's Star Wars Battlefront II from Battlefield developer DICE is popular again, with player numbers jumping on Steam to near record-levels. This is happening amidst a fan campaign for EA to make another entry in the popular, multimillion-selling franchise.</p><p>The game reached 9,292 concurrent players on Steam in the past 24 hours, which is just shy of its all-time peak concurrent record of 10,489, according to data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237950/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. The game was hovering between 1,500 and 3,000 peak concurrent players until mid-April 2025, when player numbers began surging for the eight-year-old game.</p><p>This was around the time that the Star Wars TV series Andor came back for its second and final season on Disney+.</p><p>Exactly why the game is experiencing a big uptick is unknown, but it comes amid a campaign for a third game in the new series. Recently, actor Muhannad Ben Amor from Andor posted on his Instagram story, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-andor-actor-joins-calls-for-battlefront-3-as-battlefront-2-popularity-spikes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Star Wars gotta give us Battlefront 3 ASAP."</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefront subreddit</a> is experiencing lots of activity and engagement lately, with fans discussing how much they're enjoying returning to the game. Battlefront II is included with EA Play, so that means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers also get it as part of their membership.</p><p>2015's Battlefront and 2017's Battlefront II combined to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">more than 33 million copies</a>, but despite that, EA has not confirmed any plans for more entries in the series. It was reported in 2024 that EA rejected a pitch from DICE for Battlefront III due to the licensing costs it would have to pay Disney. The report said a potential Battlefront III <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">would need to sell 20% more copies to justify its production budget.</a></p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005, and it was also developed by Pandemic. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">the second trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was finally released by Rockstar Games, and as Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick put it, it "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-broke-the-internet-take-two-boss-says/1100-6531601/" data-ref-id="1100-6531601">broke the internet</a>." To date, it has over one billion views on YouTube, so it was inevitable that fans would remix the original trailer into a new form. Now, someone has released a remake of the GTA 6 trailer with a PlayStation 2-inspired makeover.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/axZp9CH8prU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The PS2 Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer was posted on YouTube by a user called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axZp9CH8prU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Foosmoke</a>, and there appears to be some subtle humor in this video. There's clipping when Jason robs the convenience store, which is definitely true to a PS2 experience. Jason also appears to have more trouble lifting weights in this version <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6s-jason-does-he-even-lift-bro-heres-how-much-he-can-bench/1100-6531346/" data-ref-id="1100-6531346">than he did in the actual trailer</a>.</p><p>The Vice City glimpsed in this trailer remake is also noticeably less populated than the one seen in the original trailer. The PS2-era GTA games couldn't handle subtle expressions and body language in their character models like the new game can. And without those touches, this take on the GTA 6 trailer doesn't have the same resonance as the original.</p><p>Digital Foundry recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-was-only-30fps-and-it-may-be-too-much-for-switch-2/1100-6531393/" data-ref-id="1100-6531393">an in-depth look at the second GTA 6 trailer</a> and concluded that it won't be able to run on Nintendo Switch 2 despite the new system's greatly improved hardware. This PS2-style incarnation of the game would probably work for both incarnations of the Switch, but who would want to play this downgraded version after seeing what GTA 6 really looks like?</p><p>GTA 6 is coming to Xbox Series X|S and PS5 on May 26, 2026. That delay is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-could-wipe-out-a-jaw-dropping-amount-of-money-from-global-games-industry/1100-6531664/" data-ref-id="1100-6531664">estimated to cost the video game industry approximately $2.7 billion</a> in 2025, according to Ampere Analysis.</p>

                <p>This year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/warhammer-skulls-2025-all-the-game-announcements-and-news/2900-6608/" data-ref-id="2900-6608">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a> had no shortage of announcements--from an upgraded version of Space Marine to a Boltgun sequel--but for strategy fans, the highlight here was the announcement of Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition. There's no release date for it yet, but the game will be coming to PC later this year.</p><p>This new version of the classic RTS has been updated for modern systems, and players can expect 4K support, upscaled textures, and image-based lighting to enhance the visuals. While developer Relic Entertainment is aiming to retain the classic experience of the game, there will be a few other modern touches like an improved gameplay camera alongside a HUD that has been optimized for widescreen gaming.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CLDiE8OQ1M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The modding community can also expect to be catered to, as the game has been upgraded to support 64-bit platforms. This means that 20 years of community mods will continue to be supported.</p><p>In terms of content, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition will include all of the standalone expansion content--Winter Assault, Dark Crusade, and Soulstorm. First released in 2004, Dawn of War is still widely regarded to be one of the best Warhammer 40K strategy games. Its first sequel, Dawn of War 2, was released in 2009, and the threequel Dawn of War 3 launched in 2017.</p><p>In case you missed it, there were several other big announcements during Warhammer Skulls. While the sequel to the retro-flavored Boltgun won't be out for a while, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced-very-unexpected-spin-off-out-now/1100-6531732/">you can sharpen your typing skills in a free spin-off game</a> that's out right now. Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader developer Owlcat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/">announced its next game, Dark Heresy</a>, a new CRPG set in that grimdark galaxy and starring the Imperium's dreaded Inquisition.</p>
