While the NES, SNES, and Genesis controllers can be used on more games than just the ones they were intended for--depending on the inputs required--the GameCube controller will be the exception.</p><p>That's according to the disclaimer from the GameCube Classics reveal trailer from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo April Direct</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-gamecube-controller-is-only-compatible-with-gamecube-games-nintendo-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and spotted by VGC</a>).

It is worth noting that it offers extra functionality compared to the original as well, as it includes features such as wireless connectivity and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/">Switch 2's brand-new C button</a> for live chat.</p><p>Before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo delayed preorders</a> for the Switch 2, it was confirmed that players would need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to purchase the GameCube controller. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/" data-ref-id="2900-6400">The GameCube library</a> will be available through the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service, and it'll launch with Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX. Other games like Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokemon Colosseum, and more will be added further down the line.</p><p>It's not clear when Switch 2 preorders will reopen, but analysts expect <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/">Nintendo will have to raise the price of the console</a> due to US president Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>

It appears it will indeed once again return, as an image that leaked from Nintendo Korea's website appears to tease Rainbow Road.</p><p>As spotted by<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Eurogamer</a>, the Nintendo Korea website for Mario Kart World posted--and swiftly removed--the image below. It seems to suggest Rainbow Road is coming back, and might be featured on the Mario Kart World map near Princes Peach's Castle.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Mario Kart World features a sprawling, interconnected world where players can drive from one course to another.

                <p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> promotional image posted by Nintendo Korea may have accidentally revealed one of the game's major characters--a young girl who looks suspiciously similar to Pauline.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/nintendo-accidentally-leaks-an-unrevealed-donkey-kong-bananza-character-that-might-unironically-have-huge-lore-implications-for-the-mario-universe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the character's appearance in the Nintendo Korea box art has led to a flurry of speculation as fans try to decipher what role Pauline might play in the game, and whether her young appearance means Bananza is in fact a prequel.</p><p>For those less familiar with the extended Mario/Donkey Kong universe, Pauline is a side character who first appeared as the iconic damsel in distress in the 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. While she disappeared from the games for some time after that, she reappeared as the mayor of New Donk City in Super Mario Odyssey, and has since become a regular character in Mario spin-off titles.</p><p>Now, it appears that she may be returning to the Donkey Kong series, according to a piece of cover art that was posted to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/kr/switch2/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Korea</a> website. The art shows what looks like a younger Pauline holding onto Donkey Kong's tie as he smashes his way through the ground.</p><p>The art has now been replaced on the Korean site with an image that swaps Pauline for the crystalline purple sidekick known as Odd Rock. This has only led to further speculation after eagle-eyed fans noted that Pauline, in the original image, was wearing a purple crystal bracelet that seems to resemble Odd Rock.</p><p>The appearance of Pauline as a young girl has led fans to question the game's place in the Donkey Kong timeline, with some suggesting that Bananza could be a prequel game starring the original Donkey Kong--the character we've known as Donkey Kong from Nintendo's recent games is the grandson of the original, though The Super Mario Bros. Movie refers to him as his son. </p><p>Other theories speculate that the mystery character is actually Pauline's daughter, that Odd Rock is taking on her appearance, or that she has been aged down by some kind of magic or device.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza will launch on July 17, when we'll find out for sure if the mystery girl is Pauline, and what role she'll be playing in the world of Donkey Kong.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li></ul>

                <p>Supergiant Games has revealed some new details about Hades 2, including the fact that it runs at 60fps on Switch 2. The game is also launching later this year on the upcoming system as a timed console exclusive (alongside Switch 1). </p><p>"We learned so much from developing the original [Hades] on Nintendo Switch and we wanted to take those learnings forward to Nintendo Switch 2," explained studio director Amir Rao in a new Nintendo Creator's Voice video. "That meant for us being completely uncompromising when it comes to performance. We really really want our games to perform at 60fps."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He added that the extra power from Switch 2 will allow the studio to push Hades 2's graphical features. It got its second major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-the-warsong-update-adds-ares-animal-familiar-new-songs-and-more/1100-6529593/" data-ref-id="1100-6529593">the Warsong update</a>, last month, which added in areas from the first game.

It's currently in early access on Steam, so it's unclear when the full launch will happen. The game will come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles at a later date.</p><p>In GameSpot's early access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2 review</a>, we said, "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market, even in its incomplete state."</p>
