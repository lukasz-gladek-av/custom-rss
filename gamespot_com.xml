                <p>While everyone is waiting for a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> trailer, Rockstar Games has gone ahead and unveiled the next expansion for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-online-review/1900-6415473/" data-ref-id="1900-6415473">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>. Starting on December 10, players will be able to start Agents of Sabotage, a new story that introduces a renegade ex-Federal Investigation Bureau agent who is all too happy to help set up some high-stakes robberies. The first trailer for expansion sets the tone for everything to come.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3ZaWDcPiIo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/T3ZaWDcPiIo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The name of the rogue FIB operative is Jodi Marshall, and she is apparently holding quite a grudge against her former employers. More importantly, Jodi has maintained her access to sensitive FIB files, which can deliver some very valuable intel to players. In partnership with Jodi, players can take over the Darnell Bros Garment Factory and use it as a staging ground for new crimes. This expansion is also bringing back Pavel, a supporting character who appeared in The Cayo Perico Heist expansion four years ago.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-grand-theft-auto-games-are-leaving-netflixs-game-library-soon/1100-6527923/" data-ref-id="1100-6527923">Netflix is set to remove</a> Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition on December 13. GTA: San Andreas will apparently remain on the streamer for now. This move comes a few weeks after the console versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-definitive-edition-review-wasted/1900-6417791/" data-ref-id="1900-6417791">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy â€“ The Definitive Edition</a> received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-gets-long-overdue-console-patch/1100-6527714/" data-ref-id="1100-6527714">a long-awaited visual update</a>.</p><p>According to Rockstar, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Grand Theft Auto 6 is still on track to launch in 2025</a>, and GTA Online will presumably continue to be supported as well. However, it's unclear what the future holds for that game once GTA 6 becomes the gold standard of the franchise.</p>

                <p>Activision has announced what's coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone for the holiday season, and while there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-reloaded-includes-holiday-events-snowball-fights-and-new-zombies-map/2900-6010/" data-ref-id="2900-6010">plenty of festive updates planned</a>, one store bundle in particular stands out.</p><p>The "Dank Days" Tracer Pack is themed around one of Call of Duty's most enduringly popular activities: smoking pot. The bundle invites players to "coast through the holiday season" with plenty of weed-themed items, including the "Bongshot" Mastercraft blueprint for the KSV SMG. Intriguingly, Activision said the visual effects of this weapon "intensify" with successive kills. No footage has been released so far, but it seems like this could be in reference to some kind of "trippy" visual effects.</p><p>Also in the bundle is the "Blunty" operator skin, which turns your character into some kind of lizard. Then there's the "Blunt Trauma" LMG blueprint for the GPMG-7, as well as the "Weed Wacker" A.G.R. MK 1 scorestreak skin, in addition to the "Toke-a-Bloke" finishing move. The DLC also comes with the "Aim High" weapon reticle, the "My Bong" weapon charm," and "Pass It" spray, and the "Greener Grass" loading screen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4409119-dank.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409119" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4409119-dank.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409119"></a><figcaption>Say hello to Blunty.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4409119-dank.jpg"></figure><p>As mentioned, the Call of Duty series has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-will-continue-franchises-love-of-marijuana/1100-6506751/" data-ref-id="1100-6506751">featured marijuana-themed content for a long time now</a>. In 2023's Modern Warfare III, Activision brought the legendary stoners Cheech and Chong to the game as part of an event called Blaze Up. Activision even got the comedians themselves to do the voices.</p><p>For more on what's coming to Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 1 Reloaded this December, check out the gallery below.</p>
