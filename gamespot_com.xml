          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> NBA The Run - Official Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Play by Play Studios emphasized NBA The Run's rollback netcode system--an online multiplayer technology that predicts players’ inputs to reduce lag, then corrects any mismatches by rolling back and resimulating the game for smoother, near-real-time play. Rollback netcode is especially popular in the fighting game community for keeping matches responsive and fair even with high latency.</p><p>Iconic courts from around the world, including Rucker Park, Venice Beach, and The Tenement in Taguig, Philippines, will also be playable.</p><p>NBA The Run is set to launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam on PC, with cross-play enabled, sometime in 2026.</p>

<p>"I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don't," Hamaguchi said via a translator. "I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game."</p><p>He understands how contentious yellow paint--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-making-you-touch-bird-poop-over-and-over-again/1100-6535794/" data-ref-id="1100-6535794">or other forms of environmental guidance</a>--can be online. Still, without them, Hamaguchi believes players would find themselves frustrated and quit before things get good.</p><p>"The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed," Hamaguchi told GamesRadar. "So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it's done, what level and what works. And there'll still be people who say, 'No, that doesn't fit at all. We don't like that.' That's fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it's something that is definitely worth looking at."</p><p>Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-537795">Uncharted</a> series really popularized the environmental guidance we see in games today, with the likes of Crystal Dynamics' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tomb-raider/" data-ref-id="5000-92054">Tomb Raider</a> franchise, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/watch-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-143712">Watch Dogs</a> games, and more adopting this form of--dare I say--player hand-holding. The debate has been fraught for years at this point, with some games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, giving you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-has-a-no-yellow-paint-explorer-mode-to-let-you-prove-how-smart-you-are/1100-6525434/" data-ref-id="1100-6525434">the option to turn off guiding colors entirely</a> for more free-flowing exploration.</p><p>That said, it's hard to admit how much of an accessibility feature yellow paint and other forms of environmental guidance are. I can only speak for myself, but as someone who suffers from an eye condition that essentially renders me blind, yellow paint is a boon for players like me. For that reason, I go hard in the paint.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth launched in February 2024 for PlayStation 5, with a PC release following in January 2025. Part 3 of the trilogy, which is currently unnamed, doesn't have a release date right now. However, Hamaguchi and the Square Enix Creative Business Unit I team are hoping to drop the game by 2027.</p>

                <p>In Ghost of Yotei, when you're not actively battling Lord Saito's forces or frolicking through the fields of Ezo, there's a pretty good chance you're climbing some sort of mountain. As with many video games, Ghost of Yotei makes use of specially marked white stones in order to help guide you on your journey, but it wasn't until I was many hours into the story that it occurred to me: I've been touching bird poop this whole time. </p><p>There is no getting around this, and no mental gymnastics you can do to pretend it's anything else. As Atsu climbs up a mountain, the white rocks eventually lead to a white smeared area at the top. Sure, at this point, perhaps you could say that is chalk or some sort of paint. However, there is <em>always</em> a bird that just so happens to fly away just as you get there. Was that bird simply hanging out and singing a tune? Perhaps, but only if it likes to multitask while delivering an absolutely gargantuan dump. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346" data-ratio="0.560625" data-width="3200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593346"></a><figcaption>That's poop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4593346-screenshot2025-10-29at10.24.38%E2%80%AFam.jpg"></figure><p>It's gross, and I'm luckily not the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ghost-of-yotei-yellow-white-guiding-paint-bird-poo-excuse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">George Foster</a> over at TheGamer made mention of it, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ghostoftsushima/comments/1nwsvwp/how_do_we_feel_about_atsu_specifically_using/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clever Reddit user</a> even posited this is the reason why people complain about protagonist Atsu's cooking. For once, "This tastes like crap" would absolutely not be hyperbole. Let's just be thankful none of those birds have IBS, because it would both be more disgusting and impossibly difficult to figure out where to climb. </p><p>Ghost of Yotei released in early October as a PS5 exclusive.

If only we recognized the poop earlier. </p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has responded to reports that The Matrix’s creators, Lilly and Lana Wachowski, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wachowskis-wanted-hideo-kojima-to-make-a-matrix-video-game-report/1100-6535757/" data-ref-id="1100-6535757">once pitched a game idea to Konami</a> while he worked there. On his X account, Kojima posted that he was unaware that the conversation had taken place, and he was surprised to read stories suggesting that they wanted him to work on a Matrix video game adaptation.</p><p>"I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had 'offered me a Matrix game project' back in 1999," Kojima wrote. "In all these 26 years, no one ever told me such a conversation had taken place. At the time, we were mutual fans and exchanged emails. The Matrix hadn’t been released in Japan yet, but I had already seen it in theaters in the US and at a preview screening. When the Wachowskis came to Japan for promotion, I believe I met them three times."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1983390844037009907" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was surprised to see on social media that the Wachowski sisters had “offered me a Matrix game project!” back in 1999.

"If someone had told me, maybe there could've been a way to make it work," Kojima added. In the original interview on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/10/they-were-big-fans-of-kojima-the-wachowskis-once-asked-the-metal-gear-creator-to-make-a-matrix-video-game" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, Bergstresser recalled a meeting with the Wachowskis and former CEO of Konami Digital Entertainment, Kazumi Kitaue, but Kojima says he wasn't present for it, and he arrived back at Konami headquarters after the discussion had wrapped up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-speaks-about-the-matrix/1100-2448486/">Kojima and the Wachowskis eventually met up</a> and discussed the similarities between their work, but with the entire story taking place over 25 years ago, some details might have been lost to time here. Several video games based on The Matrix would eventually be developed, and in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-matrix-awakens-an-unreal-engine-5-experience-is-live-now/1100-6498795/">Epic released an Unreal Engine 5 tech demo set in that cyberpunk world</a>.</p><p>As for the film franchise, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/matrix-5-lana-wachowski-executive-producing-1235959174/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a fifth Matrix movie is currently in development</a>, but the Wachowskis won't be directing it. The Martian screenwriter Drew Goddard is working on the script and will direct the film, but it's unclear if series regulars Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, or any of the new characters introduced in 2021's The Matrix Resurrections will return for this installment.</p>
