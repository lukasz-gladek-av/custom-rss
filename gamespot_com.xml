              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In the cavernous convention halls of Gamescom 2025, conference attendees gawk at towering installations of fabricated castle sets and pirate ships. The massive movie set-esque booths inspire awe, but off center and to the side of these constructions rests another installation--one that has managed to draw an equally impressive crowd without a flashy monument. Wrapped around this booth are chattering fans--many who appear to be women and femmes in their 20s and 30s--all queued in a line long enough to wrap around a city block. They'll remain this way for the better part of an hour, a singular goal making this endeavor worth the wait: taking a photo with a cutout of their favorite man from Love and Deepspace.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Papergames, a China-based studio known for its work on the Nikki franchise, Love and Deepspace is a narrative-focused mobile game in which players romance and bond with a cast of five men. Since its release in January of 2024--and in the past year especially--Love and Deepspace has inspired a fervor comparable to those around the most beloved boy bands. It won Best Mobile Game Award at Gamescom 2025 and <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/anime-style-dating-sim-love-and-deepspace-surpasses-750m/" rel="nofollow ">surpassed $750 million</a> in gross player spending within two years of release.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet Love and Deepspace is more than any individual statistic or accolade. It is an absolute phenomenon--one that has also inspired a fandom characterized not just by its sheer size, but by the dedication of its fans. If you have been curious about the game,or rather what makes it so special, here is everything you need to know about the viral sensation, Love and Deepspace.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Love and Deepspace?</h2><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace is a free-to-play otome game available on mobile devices. In case you are new to the genre, the term "otome" refers to narrative-heavy games in which players can romance characters in the game. The game's main story features a sci-fi scenario where the protagonist, known in the game as a hunter, joins an organization that protects the planet from malicious aliens. As you play, the game flits between date scenarios with its swoony men, 3D-action combat challenges, and its overarching story, revealing a depth and wealth of gameplay options.</p><p dir="ltr">At the heart of Love and Deepspace are its five romanceable men: Xavier, Rafayel, Zayne, Sylus, and Caleb. Each has their own personality and fulfills their own archetype. Rayafel is youthful and goofy, whereas Zayne is withholding, but mature. Xavier is protective and calm, whereas Sylus has an almost threatening aura. Depending on how dominant, soft, practical, or creative you like your man, players can spend time with the romantic interest (or interests) that best fit their preferences.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625557" data-ratio="0.56306677658697" data-width="1213" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625557"></a><figcaption>Love in Deepspace.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4625557-love.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Because Love and Deepspace is a live-service game, its developers are constantly giving players new ways to interact with its cast; this leads to there being loads of minigames and different features contained within it. In the main menus, you can interact with the boys almost as if they're little Tamagotchi pets. It's both easy and encouraged for you to use your phone to poke and prod at them, or even breathe on them by using the microphone. All this, and other features like one that plays AMSR-esque audio of a boy breathily talking to you, create a sense of intimacy and connection with the characters in this world--one that has ultimately helped establish it as the go-to otome game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Why is Love and Deepspace so popular?</h2><p dir="ltr">As is the case with most hit games, a combination of cultural factors and specific qualities about Love and Deepspace have helped contribute to its success. On a practical level, the game is easy to begin playing. All an interested player needs is a smart phone with enough empty storage space and they can get started for free. This low entry barrier ensures that the game can accrue players easily. However, there's more to it than that.</p><p dir="ltr">In the past five or so years, gacha games like Love and Deepspace have grown in popularity stateside thanks to the success of Genshin Impact and similar titles. Growing familiarity with the model of gacha games--and other elements like industry reports that show <a href="https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/digital-media-trends-consumption-habits-survey/2024/how-can-gaming-industry-get-more-female-gamers.html" rel="nofollow ">live-service games aimed at women and femmes</a> are an underserved market --have buoyed its overall popularity. Then, you need to think about the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">With Love and Deepspace, Papergames has proven it is possible to pack AAA-level, hyper-realistic graphics into a mobile game. That, paired with its first-person perspective, help the game avoid any kind of uncanny valley sensation, and endear its boys with a sense of genuine liveliness as players interact with them. It makes sense, then, that Love and Deepspace skyrocketed past other similar titles and became the most profitable otome game in the <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/2024-q2-ios-top-5-otome%20games-revenue-us-60789073241bc16eb88c6e7f" rel="nofollow ">United States within a year of its release</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">So are all Love and Deepspace players just really horny for fake men?</h2><p dir="ltr">Love and Deepspace has plenty of racy outfits and spicy moments, but it doesn't portray sex or nudity. When situations do intensify,NSFW content is largely implied rather than explicitly shown, with the game instead highlighting the romantic elements at play rather than any exposed skin. For example, the excitement might come from Xavier taking and kissing the player's hand gently rather than from any implied sex.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm a sucker for a good romance, so having this game is like having a fun, sort of corny, very dramatic romance novel that I can appreciate and enjoy from a million different scenarios," Lon, a Rafayel fan who started playing in the spring of 2025, said. "It's a romance novel that writes its own fanfiction--<em>and </em>I can write my own fanfiction as well."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the romantic elements, those unfamiliar with the audience might assume Love and Deepspace is all about people using fictional men to live out their fantasies. This might be true for some players, but the relationship with these virtual men isn't so two-dimensional.</p><p dir="ltr">Rowan, a Love and Deepspace devotee who started playing in early 2025 after hearing about the game from friends, likened the boys to "court jesters" or "lab specimens." If they get bored, they can use the game to play a card game with one of the boys or watch them "fail at a claw machine."</p><p dir="ltr">"Something I think a lot of people misunderstand is that fans of [Love and Deepspace] generally don't <em>actually </em>think the guys are real or our boyfriends. It really is more like we are all fans of the game, and while we have our--to use Kpop terminology, 'biases'--at the end of the day, we are all just having fun. And yes, there is combat in this game. Really. It can get very hard sometimes,," Rowan laughed.</p><p dir="ltr">Rowan emphasized that it's not just about connecting with the boys on screen, but others who enjoy the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I talk to my friends who play the game every day, and I interact with other fans on TikTok and Bluesky," Rowan said. "We talk about the guys and their habits and voice lines; events that are going on, or levels we are trying to clear. It's a lot like being a fan of a boy band: Part of what makes it popular is being popular, in a way."</p>

<section><p>And it's really tough to tell if that's a good thing or a bad thing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit.</p><p dir="ltr">Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot happened in Fortnite during the past year. To make it all a little easier to digest, let's go through the biggest developments one by one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135"></a><figcaption>Brainrot is taking over Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Rise of the Brainrots</h2><p dir="ltr">The Creative part of Fortnite got its first genuine blockbuster in 2025 with Steal the Brainrot, a licensed clone of one of Roblox's most popular modes. Steal the Brainrot was an instant success in Fortnite, and it consistently averages enough concurrent players that it can compete with Epic's battle royale modes. Now, Epic is planning to capitalize on Brainrot's success by allowing creators using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">V-Bucks transactions to their islands</a>, something the Roblox version of the Brainrot game has that Fortnite's currently does not.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the success of this mode means Epic has decided to use it as a focus in its marketing for Fortnite as a whole, as well as promoting it generally by placing it in the in-game news feed. That's proven to be incredibly off-putting for folks who aren't interested in that mode--which is pretty much everyone who doesn't already play it.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Brainrots apparently here to stay, there's reason to worry that Fortnite might soon be flooded with this sort of goofy nonsense aimed entirely at children. Epic has already made it unnecessarily difficult for folks who just want to play BR to sift through all the Creative islands and other modes they don't care about in Fortnite's messy Discover tab.</p><p dir="ltr">The problem is that Fortnite does not offer any way to tailor your Discover tab at all except favoriting modes and maps that you like. You can't, for example, tell it that you're not interested in Steal the Brainrot, so there's no way to escape the noise or pretend it doesn't exist because Epic is constantly promoting it to you. It's not fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG, Reload, Blitz, and Delulu are all here to stay, apparently.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The fracturing of battle royale</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite added several new battle royale spinoff modes in the past year, starting with the permanent OG mode that has been revisiting Chapter 1. In addition to more or less recreating the game as it existed seven years ago, this mode even got its own new battle pass, the OG pass, for each of its seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Then we had Blitz Royale, which arrived during the summer with a focus on mobile players, thanks to its short matches on a small island. Epic has done tons of fine-tuning on Blitz Royale since it launched, trying all sorts of novel mechanics, like granting all players a super-powered medallion to start a match--though since the beginning of November, Blitz is more like a tiny version of standard Battle Royale, without as many gimmicks. But Blitz has changed so frequently that it's never had a real status quo--which is a great way to keep players' interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic followed that up with Delulu, a weekends-only mode with proximity voice chat that allows players to form impromptu teams--and then betray each other if they want to.</p><p dir="ltr">Somehow, these new modes--alongside Reload, OG, and regular Battle Royale--have all managed to maintain healthy populations at the same time. They absolutely do cannibalize each other a bit, but not so much that it affects matchmaking in any particular mode for most folks. It's tough to imagine that Epic could get away with any more new BR modes without a bump to Fortnite's overall population, but Epic clearly knows this too--that's probably why Delulu is only available on the weekends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137"></a><figcaption>Fortnite got really into releasing new music skins this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Going all in on celebs</h2><p dir="ltr">Being a rhythm game, Fortnite Festival was never going to pull hundreds of thousands of concurrent users over the long term in the way Battle Royale does. These days, the mode has a small but dedicated playerbase, but the cosmetics associated with the mode--skins of pop stars in the item shop and the seasonal music passes--have clearly been a big success for Epic, because the company has been doing a lot more of those types of collabs in general this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Just in the past few months, Fortnite has introduced new collaborations with five musical artists (Deadmau5, Daft Punk, Doja Cat, Tyler the Creator, and Playboi Carti) that were not Festival headliners, and then Epic punctuated its newly ramped-up celeb obsession by adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian</a> in December. Considering how popular these celebrity and popstar skins have been lately--it feels like we've been battling Sabrina Carpenters nonstop in BR this year--you can probably expect even more crossovers of this type in 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will sell you in-game pets now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">New virtual toys to spend money on</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic Games has been gradually introducing new types of cosmetics over the last couple of years. Back in Chapter 5, it added cars, musical instruments, and various Lego things. Kicks popped up just before the start of Chapter 6 a year ago, and in 2025, we got sidekicks--essentially pets who follow us around and get excited when we perform certain in-game actions. While the new Chapter 5 cosmetics struggled so much out of the gate that Epic had to lower some of their prices--it turned out that 4,000 V-Bucks was kind of a lot for a Fortnite car--kicks seem to have done well, and sidekicks are a definite hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, there's been plenty of grumbling about both of the most recently added new cosmetic types--folks who aren't sneakerheads tend to scoff at kicks, and there was a lot of frustration that you can only customize your sidekick's appearance once before it locks permanently. But folks are buying them nonetheless. It's rare that I have a teammate who doesn't have a pet dog or cat (or chicken) following them around.</p><p dir="ltr">And speaking personally, as somebody who's been playing for years and has tons of skins, I like being able to branch out with new stuff. I really don't need more skins at this point, but having Itchy from The Simpsons follow me around and celebrate my kills is delightful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141"></a><figcaption>Fortnite let us have some uncanny conversations with Darth Vader in May.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The AI slop is coming?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite is not currently any sort of wasteland of AI nonsense, the first red flags popped up this year. Epic's most notable AI-driven creation was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">Darth Vader NPC in Battle Royale</a> during the Star Wars mini-season in May, who could respond dynamically, in the voice of the late James Earl Jones, to things players said to him. It was definitely weird, but at least it was something that might have been impractical to try <em>without</em> AI.</p><p dir="ltr">Other apparent AI things have begun popping up here and there within Fortnite since then. Epic gave out a free jam track in October that had <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI-generated cover art featuring Hatsune Miku</a>--even though the track had nothing to do with Miku. There are some pieces of art in the game in Chapter 7 that have commonly been accused of being AI-generated, like a poster of a Yeti in a hammock in which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one of his feet has five toes while the other has four</a>. And <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20956" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an emote</a> on Lisa's music pass uses a licensed 2025 song so obscure that nobody even knows who made it--and it sounds very much like it's AI-generated. Oh, and those Brainrots? All of those are AI-generated meme designs from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/09/19/robloxs-italian-brainrot-trend-explained/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Italian Brainrot trend</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">To be honest, all of that really doesn't add up to very much. But when you take those things alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/" data-ref-id="1100-6536526">recent comments from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>--in which he said it's absurd for Steam to require disclosure if AI-generated content is used in a game's development because AI will soon be involved in all dev work--there's certainly some reason to worry that Epic might be planning to unleash the slop in its never-ending pursuit of the children who play Roblox.</p>
