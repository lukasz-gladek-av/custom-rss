                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Season 5 update arrives on August 7, bringing the Reckoning as the final Zombies map for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>. Treyarch has <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" rel="nofollow ">released a new video</a> to discuss some of the new features and details players can expect for this Zombies finale, which includes parachutes, upgradable traps, and the brand-new Wonder Weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's latest video gives a deep dive into the Reckoning map, which takes place at Liberty Fall's Janus Towers location. The map features three tall towers for players to fight the undead. These spaces can be navigated with teleporters, anti-gravity launchers, and parachutes, marking the first time parachutes are featured on a traditional round-based Zombies map.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Get an inside look at the conclusion of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> Zombies üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>Treyarch takes us inside Reckoning, breaking down the final map and the new features that deliver an unforgettable finale üî• <a href="https://t.co/pdQpcmv1XV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/pdQpcmv1XV</a></p></div>  ‚Äî Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The video also teases that parts of the Reckoning map will feature low gravity. This seems to include the map's Pack-a-Punch room, as the Pack-a-Punch machine can be seen floating around with some zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new feature is the ability to upgrade traps on the map. Players can interact with a new machine on the map called Caster, which lets them upgrade various traps. The video shows off one of the new traps, which is a wall-mounted cannon that shoots dark aether energy, and the developer says the trap can be updated with parts to make it more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows the map's unique Wonder Weapon in action. The Reckoning map features the Gorgofex, which is a pistol-type weapon that fires Aether-based energy. This Wonder Weapon will feature two possible upgrades to make it even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Uberklaus is the name for the map's new elite enemy type. Uberklaus will have two phases to fight. The enemy starts off inside a giant mech suit, and dealing enough damage will cause the robot inside to eject from the suit for the second fight phase.</p><p dir="ltr">This Zombies conclusion arrives along with plenty of new updates for multiplayer and Warzone. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/">Call of Duty Season 5</a> brings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-5-every-new-map-and-mode-coming-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer/2900-6825/">new maps and modes</a> to Black Ops 6 multiplayer, and the rooftop of Warzone's Stadium POI is finally opening up to provide a new playable area.</p>

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September. Diablo 4 was also recently cleared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release in China</a> after receiving governmental approval.</p>

<p>"Game wont load now," said one player on the game's Steam forum. "Maybe it's just me, but I was playing 20 minutes before the update and now it wont launch."</p><p>Another player said, "I downloaded the 1.3.0 patch and ran the game, but it suddenly stopped working. I reinstalled it and ran it again, but it still won't work. It worked fine before the patch."</p><p>For those experiencing the same issue, a Stellar Blade developer who goes by 'Wolfcastle' on Steam has offered a possible solution to the problem (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/stellar-blade/update-problems" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>).</p><p>"If you are having issues launching the game after updating, there may be an incompatibility with UE4SS or mod you are using," Wolfcastle <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/eventcomments/604163526655818928?snr=1_2108_9__2107#c604163526655825025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. "Please try completely removing these files and seeing if the issue persists." However, a different player said the suggestion didn't work even after removing their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stellar-blade-mods/2900-6696/" data-ref-id="2900-6696">Stellar Blade mods</a>.</p><p>Shift Up hasn't responded to this issue just yet, but one user on the Stellar Blade <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1mh1oli/stellar_blade_gets_surprise_patch_on_the_weekend/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has suggested a temporary fix that requires players to edit their UE4SS files in the game's directory.</p><p>Among the list of bug fixes, patch 1.3.0 also adds an improved photo mode and players will now need to restart their game when enabling the FSR frame generation. You can check out the full patch notes below, along with the PS5 patch notes.</p><h3><strong>Stellar Blade PC Version 1.3.0 and PS5 Version 1.013 - Patch Notes</strong></h3><p><strong>PS5 &amp; PC Shared update details</strong></p><ul><li>Improved Photo Mode so that when selecting a logo, the logo control indicator is now displayed</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to exit the shop after purchasing the 'Polarized Sunglasses' from Clyde‚Äôs shop</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve‚Äôs hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytiba cutscene when wearing the 'Fluffy Bear' or 'Pink Bear' outfits</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve's final Korean voice-over line was cut off during the 'Lost Items from Heaven' conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert</li><li>Fixed an issue where Eve‚Äôs arm would occasionally appear unnatural in Photo Mode when wearing the 'Black Pearl' or 'Red Pearl' outfits</li></ul><p><strong>PS5</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where entering the 'Demogorgon' battle with 'Ranged Auto Aim' turned OFF would cause the camera to shift away from its intended position, making it impossible to aim</li></ul><p><strong>PC</strong></p><ul><li>When using FSR upscaler, restarting the game is now required to enable frame generation</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Fusion Weapon was not visible when beginning the fight against the Airborne Squad after defeating Providence</li><li>Fixed an issue where using the numpad on the keyboard to trigger skills in the Training Room caused the training system to become unresponsive</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when fishing for the 'Betta' fish with mouse and keyboard, the gray striped pattern of the progress bar would obscure the reel-in progress bar</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when using the 'Stinger', target lock-on would not function correctly under specific input conditions</li><li>Fixed an issue where the zoom function in the Hair Salon menu would not respond to controller or keyboard input</li><li>Fixed an issue where dialogue would occasionally not display after interacting with Adam in the Eidos 9 Atelier</li><li>Fixed an issue where Dororong would occasionally not appear during their introduction scene in Xion</li><li>Fixed an issue where newly unlocked items would not immediately appear after increasing shop affinity level</li><li>Improved the save timestamp system so that time since last save is now accurately displayed based on successful saves, rather than attempted saves</li><li>Enhanced the save failure message by changing it to yellow for better visibility</li><li>Various other bug fixes</li></ul>
