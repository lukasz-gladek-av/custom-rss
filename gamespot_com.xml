                <p dir="ltr">It might look like Advance Wars. It might even play similarly to Advance Wars. But <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warside</a> is its own game, and it's coming out in roughly a month on PC: April 14. Meanwhile, a console release should be coming soon, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher First Break Labs revealed Warside's release date in a new trailer for the game--seen below. As you can see, the turn-based title resembles Advance Wars, featuring infantry, tanks, and airplanes that can be moved around a tile-based map. The pixel art even shares similarities with the long-running Nintendo franchise.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Warside - Release Date Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Warside is touted as a "fast-paced, turn-based tactics game" and will offer a story campaign alongside multiplayer support. First Break Labs is also promising 14 playable commanders (possessing their own passive skills and powers), over 30 unit types, and a map editor.</p><p dir="ltr">This appears to be the first title from developer Lavabird Games. The team actually launched a successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lavabird/warside-a-pixel-art-turn-based-tactics-game" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter for Warside</a> in 2023 and ultimately signed with First Break Labs in 2024. A free demo was released for the game in September on PC.</p><p>In addition to PC, Warside is also planned for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. As for Advance Wars, Nintendo last revisited the franchise with the remake package <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/advance-wars-12-re-boot-camp-review-war-games/1900-6418056/">Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</a> in 2023. The Switch exclusive was supposed to launch earlier but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/advance-wars-1-2-re-boot-camp-delayed-due-to-world-events/1100-6501375/">got delayed in March 2022 because of "world events"</a>--commonly believed to be the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p>

                <p>After launching the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amd-radeon-9070-gpus-have-arrived-but-retailers-are-selling-out-fast/1100-6529943/" data-ref-id="1100-6529943">Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9070 XT GPUs</a> last week, AMD has now officially launched the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D processors. Early reviews are praising the components as some of the most powerful CPUs on the market--so if you’re piecing together a premium gaming rig, they’re likely a good fit for your needs. However, they’re bound to be a hot commodity, so if you find one in stock, it’s a good idea to pick it up while you can. The 9950X3D costs $699, while the 9900X3D costs $599.</p><h3>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D/9900X3D Restock Tracker</h3><p>These two CPUs are the successors to the popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, which launched last November and quickly became the must-have processor for gaming and high-end development applications. The 9950X3D and 9900X3D aim to offer an even more well-rounded experience. The 9800X3D has been hard to find in stock, but if you want to save some cash, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/pc/229189?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">current No. 1 best-selling CPU</a> for $480 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>.</p><p>The 9950X3D is the more premium of the two, offering up to 5.7GHz, 16 cores, and 32 threads. It also gets you 64MB of 3D V-Cache to enhance its performance when running demanding gaming. The 9900X3D, meanwhile, features 12 cores, 24 threads, and speeds up to 5.5GHz. It also benefits from a 64MB 3D V-Cache.</p><h3>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D and 9900X3D at Amazon</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-9950X3D-16-Core-Processor/dp/B0DVZSG8D5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 9 9950X3D</a> -- $699</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-9900X3D-12-Core-Processor/dp/B0DWGWN8GY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ryzen 9 9900X3D</a> -- $599</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4458229-amdryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458229" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4458229-amdryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458229"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4458229-amdryzen.jpg"></figure><p>While these will likely be popular models with gamers, AMD is hoping they’ll be a hit with content creators and programmers requiring loads of processing power. The early consensus is that the two CPUs are absolute powerhouses and overkill for most users--but if you need the best on the market, they’re certainly worth a closer look.</p><p>We’ve already seen the Ryzen 9 9900X3D and 9950X3D go out of stock multiple times, so be sure to check back often for inventory updates.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/akira-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-edition-gets-nice-launch-discount-at-amazon/1100-6528513/">Akira 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Edition Gets Nice Launch Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/1972-piece-lego-mario-kart-display-model-revealed-on-mario-day/1100-6530000/">1,972-Piece Lego Mario Kart Display Model Revealed On Mario Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-hd-remaster-collection-is-steeply-discounted-for-pc-on-launch-day/1100-6526150/">Suikoden HD Remaster Collection Is Steeply Discounted For PC On Launch Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-master-sword-replica-on-sale-for-big-discount-at-amazon/1100-6523376/">Zelda Master Sword Replica On Sale For Big Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The investment group, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">previously urged Ubisoft management to make drastic changes</a>, said Ubisoft needs to disclose a "clear roadmap for recovery" amid "declining shareholder value, lackluster operational execution, and failure to adapt effectively to market trends."</p><p>Krupa went on to say that the private financial market platform MergerMarket carried a story that claims Ubisoft was talking to Microsoft, EA, and other companies about potentially acquiring unspecified franchises from Ubisoft. Krupa said Ubisoft management failed to disclose these discussions publicly.</p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">reiterated what it said months ago</a>, which is that Ubisoft is in the process of conducting a strategic review of "transformation strategic and capitalistic options," but that the company does not plan to make public announcements until a possible deal materializes.</p><p>In addition to possibly Microsoft and EA, Ubisoft is reported to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">possibly be in discussions with Tencent about some kind of financing deal.</a> It remains to be seen how this might all materialize, but one possibility that's rumored is Ubisoft selling off individual franchises.</p><p>Krupa added that the latest delay for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> to March 20 caused Ubisoft's stock to decline in value, but mainly retail investors were harmed by this--not institutional investors like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Because Ubisoft did not act "appropriately," as AJ Investments sees it, the company is asking frustrated investors to join a protest planned for May.</p><p>Krupa said AJ Investments will call of its protest if Ubisoft's strategic review leads to an end result that increases shareholder value. It also hasn't ruled out suing Ubisoft.</p><p>"Ubisoft has continued to underperform compared to its industry peers, and it is time for the company to listen to its shareholders. This demonstration will be a powerful statement from investors who believe in the company's potential but demand urgent change," Krupa said.</p><p>As mentioned, Ubisoft's next big release is Assassin's Creed Shadows on March 20. It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210"> shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p>
