                <p dir="ltr">In a surprise announcement, Kojima Productions has revealed that Death Stranding is now available on Xbox Series X|S. The first game produced by Hideo Kojima and his studio after he left Konami, Death Stranding was released five years ago on PS4 and would be followed by PC and iOS ports in 202 and 2023, respectively. As a launch special, publisher 505 Games is offering Death Stranding at a 50% discount on Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the director's cut edition, which added enhanced graphical options, gameplay changes, and new content on top of the original game. Set in a world where humanity had barely survived an extinction-level event, Death Stranding follows Sam Porter Bridges on a post-apocalyptic trek as he explores the USA and works to reconnect its various cities.</p><p dir="ltr">The game also featured a star-studded cast, with many of the characters not only being voiced by famous faces but also adopting their likenesses for Death Stranding. Bridges was played by Norman Reedus, and other roles were filled by Lea Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Troy Baker, Guillermo del Toro, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the face of all of Death Stranding's violence, its dead things, its surreal horror, and the bleakest, salted-earth portrayal of the post-apocalypse, there has always been this strong mote of hope and love and bonding and connection that's never been more necessary," Justin Clark wrote in GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746"> Death Stranding: Director's Cut review</a>. "If nothing else, Death Stranding: Director's Cut is the best excuse to return to the valley of the shadow of death, and find the grim beauty waiting there. What the new features and content bring to the table is simply making that return easier and more welcoming than ever."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/" data-ref-id="1100-6509825">A sequel was officially revealed in 2022</a> after months of teases, and while<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214"> Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> doesn't have an exact release date yet, it does look like it'll be a wild follow-up to the original. Film and television company A24 also announced last year that it'll be working with Kojima Productions to produce a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-and-a24-are-teaming-up-to-create-a-death-stranding-film-universe/1100-6519941/" data-ref-id="1100-6519941"> live-action adaptation of Death Stranding</a>, and Kojima is hoping<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-win-prestigous-film-festival-awards/1100-6520961/" data-ref-id="1100-6520961"> it'll pick up a few prestigious awards</a> on the film circuit.</p><p>On top of that Death Stranding work, Kojima has also teamed up with Get Out director Jordan Peele on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/od-trailer-seems-to-contain-silent-hills-reference/1100-6519914/">OD</a> for Xbox Game Studios and he's also developing on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">Metal Gear-like game under the working title of Physint</a>.</p>

                <p>Last year, Epic Games brought back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale-review-laying-the-foundatio/1900-6416891/" data-ref-id="1900-6416891">Fortnite</a>'s original island in a month-long event called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-4-season-5-update-revealed/2900-4930/" data-ref-id="2900-4930">Fortnite OG</a>. The chance to revisit the earliest version of the game was wildly popular with players, and now reports are emerging that Fortnite OG will be returning on a permanent basis starting in December.</p><p>Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/hypex/status/1853920988594930095?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HypeX</a> were the first to report the news. The first 10 seasons of Fortnite, which collectively make up Chapter 1, are said to be returning on a monthly basis, and only the OG loot will be supported. Additionally, both Fortnite's battle royale mode and Zero Build modes will be incorporated into OG.</p><p>When Fortnite OG launched in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-breaks-its-all-time-player-records-at-launch/1100-6518929/" data-ref-id="1100-6518929">over 44.7 million users logged in to play</a>, which marked the most popular single day in the history of the game. That massive response surely played a role in the decision to bring Fortnite OG back alongside the current incarnation of the game.</p><p>None of this has been confirmed by Epic Games yet, but the report suggests that the official reveal may occur during Fortnite Remix's finale on November 30, or during The Game Awards on December 13. Mind you, this is all likely to occur alongside the presumed Chapter 6 map, too.</p><p>But before Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 comes to an end, rapper <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">Eminem will return to the game</a> on November 7. If players can defeat Eminem in battle, they'll earn his new Mythic RG Minigun, which can fire bullets and lines from Eminem's raps. And if that's not enough for players, Fortnite Chapter 6 is set to launch on December 1, shortly after the Remix finale event concludes.</p>
