The game <a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1932361295849767201" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">briefly went offline</a> after launch for patch 1.1.0.11 to be applied, mainly targeting improvements to servers and stability.</p><p>Despite requiring downtime, the 1.1.0.11 patch notes are brief. The changes detailed include "another set of changes to further improve the game server and client stability," and "more localization." The patch also fixes a handful of minor, but annoying, bugs.</p>

<p>Dune: Awakening has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">big numbers</a> on Steam so far--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lot-of-people-are-playing-dune-awakening-despite-being-in-premium-early-access/1100-6532178/" data-ref-id="1100-6532178">even in its paid early-access</a> period. At the time of writing, now that the game is officially released for all players, Awakening is the 10th-most-played game on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 142,000 players. The game also has very positive reviews on Steam, though even the positive reviews note a bit of wonkiness with the game's current state, especially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">when it comes to performance</a>.</p><p>Without the extensive early-access period <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-isnt-early-access-but-will-let-you-pay-to-play-early/1100-6530320/" data-ref-id="1100-6530320">often used</a> for this kind of online survival-crafting game, Funcom has been using the paid earl- access period to rapidly patch issues as they arise--including <a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1931366318730625479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">adding new servers</a> as they become necessary.</p><p>The 1.1.0.11 patch notes can be found in full below, but it seems likely Funcom will continue to regularly patch the game as issues arise in its early lifespan.

                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, Microsoft opened the final day with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> that threw the spotlight on titles coming to Xbox Series X|S either this year or next. Following the presentation, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer briefly addressed the challenges of "running a good business" while remaining accountable to Microsoft's expectations for the division.</p><p>"Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business," said Spencer during his appearance on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a>. "We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we're doing. It does mean we have to make tradeoffs through the year on things that we're going to invest more in. [And] things that we're not going to invest as much in, because we are the business that we are. But the business is having really good success."</p><p>Spencer touted Game Pass as "having an amazing year" and praised Xbox's first-party games for their performance in 2025. It's worth noting that Spencer has used similar language about running "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">a sustainable business</a>" to explain the closures of studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.</a> The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">successfully revived by its new owner</a>, Krafton, but other studios weren't as lucky and numerous devs lost their jobs.</p><p>Additionally, Spencer has explained repeatedly that the decision to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and other former Xbox-exclusive titles to PlayStation was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">a business call</a>. That proved to be a fortuitous choice for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a>, both of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topped PSN charts in April</a>.</p><p>During his podcast appearance, Spencer said that watching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a> come together for the Xbox Games Showcase "reignited my Double Fine love."

                <p>Gamers may have noticed a recent email about instructions for getting their share of a legal settlement with GameStop.

And if you've purchased something online from GameStop in the last five years, then the company may owe you some money.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Settlement%20Agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a class-action settlement</a> filed earlier this year, GameStop <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has put forth $4.5 million</a> to resolve the issue of whether the company improperly disclosed customers' personal information to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel (now Meta Pixel) without their permission.</p><h3>Who can file a claim for their share of the settlement?</h3><p>There are two primary criteria for getting a share this settlement. Recipients are only eligible if they purchased a video game from GameStop's site between August 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025. Players also need to have maintained a public Facebook profile with their real names at the time the purchase was made.</p><h3>What's the settlement amount per person?</h3><p>GameStop customers who qualify for the settlement can choose between a cash payment of up to $5 in cash or up to $10 as a voucher that can be used on GameStop's site. Players who opt for the former can receive payments through Paypal, Venmo, and Zelle. Those who opt for the voucher will receive the credit through their GameStop account. The voucher will expire one year after it is received.</p><h3>How can a claim be filed?</h3><p>There are two options to file a claim. Customers can either <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Home/SubmitClaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fill out this online form</a> or print out <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this PDF form</a>, complete the requested information, and mail it to the following address:</p><p>GameStop VPPA Settlement Administrator</p><p>P.O. Box 4129</p><p>Portland, OR 97208-4129</p><h3>What's the deadline to file a claim?</h3><p>The deadline to file a claim or to object to the class settlement is August 15, 2025. The date of the final approval hearing is September 18, 2025. All payments and vouchers are expected to be distributed 55 days after the final approval of the deal and the conclusion of any appeals.</p>

                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars. While Microsoft has yet to elaborate on how the company will celebrate that milestone, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has indicated that 2026 will be "really special" for Xbox fans with returning franchises.</p><p>"When you think about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">Fable</a>, when you think about Gears, when you think about Forza, I mean, these are franchises that have been really part of what makes Xbox what it is today," said Spencer on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. "And it's going to be a nice lineup next year. I love the games that we've launched so far in [2025]. I think, as you already went through, we have a strong finish to 2025. And then when I look at [2026] and our 25th anniversary and the franchises that we're going to launch in that year, I think it's going to be a really special year for Xbox next year."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a> is one of the Xbox titles expected to arrive in 2026 alongside Fable and a new Forza game. Last fall, Microsoft shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">ambitious plans for the Halo franchise</a>, but it's unknown if a new title in the franchise will arrive in 2026. It's possible that another remake or remaster of the original Halo will be released next year.</p><p>Spencer's latest interview didn't mention whether next year's marquee Xbox titles will also be coming to PlayStation 5. The decision to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a> on Sony's console led to both games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topping the PSN charts in April</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>--which was published by Microsoft-owned Bethesda--also placed among PSN's top 20 titles for April, and DLC is coming later this year.</p><p>The original Xbox launched on November 15, 2001 in North America. Presumably Microsoft will disclose its anniversary plans before that date in 2026.</p>
