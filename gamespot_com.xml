                <p>The life-sim game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529953/" data-ref-id="1100-6529953">InZoi</a> is coming this month, and the game's developer has finally confirmed additional key details, including the price of the game at launch.</p><p>Game director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim said during the InZoi global showcase that the game will debut on Steam in early access for $40, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzoi-will-cost-as-much-as-a-sims-4-expansion-pack-and-until-it-leaves-early-access-all-dlcs-and-updates-will-be-free/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. He said the game still has "a lot to improve on," which is part of the reason why it's launching in early access.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kjun also confirmed that InZoi will receive four free updates throughout 2025, while smaller updates will add things like new outfits and furniture--the plan is for these smaller updates to come at a pace of every three months. However, the final plan is not finalized and things could change, he said.</p><p>An update planned for May will allow players to visit a gym where they can change their character's body shape; an August update will add a "cat-themed city" for <a href="https://awareness-days.co.uk/awareness-day/international-cat-day/2025-08-08/#:~:text=August%208%2C%202025&amp;text=This%20day%20encourages%20cat%20lovers,a%20leading%20cat%20welfare%20charity." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">International Cat Day</a>. Updates will also add things like modding support, in-game cheat codes, an adoption system, the ability to swim, freelancer jobs, hotkey customization, and the ability to change the temperature of indoor environments.</p><p>InZoi is a Sims-like life sim from InZoi Studio and published by PUBG company Krafton. Like The Sims, players create, control, and observe the lives of "Zois" who are living in a simulation of the player's design.</p><p>InZoi releases in early access for PC on March 27. It's also in the works for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but a release date for those console platforms has not been announced.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">Scopely confirmed that it's buying the gaming division of Niantic</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> and other hit mobile games. It was a $3.5 billion deal, and one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">largest gaming buyouts in history</a>. But for any fans who are worried about Scopely imposing certain unwanted changes on Pokemon Go, the game's senior director, Michael Steranka, wants to assure them that won't be the case.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/541768/scopely-niantic-interview-michael-steranka" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Steranka indicated that he's spent months talking with Scopely's team, and he related that they don't want to rock the boat of Pokemon Go's success. For example, he indicated that Steranka won't shift the game from a free-to-play model, or force intrusive ads into the experience.</p><p>"[Intrusive ads are] not happening in Pokemon Go--not now, not ever," said Steranka. "Again, Scopely really recognizes how unique this game is, and they've told us themselves that they would be foolish to try to change the recipe of what's made this such a huge hit and a success. So yeah, absolutely not. We will not be building into our games any type of obtrusive ads or anything like that. I just really want to reiterate Scopely as a company, the way that they operate is they give all of their teams the agency to make the decisions thatâ€™s right for their games. And that is not something that we feel would ever be right for Pokemon Go."</p><p>Regarding player data, Steranka reiterated that the company doesn't sell that to third parties, and offered assurances that it won't be changing that policy now or in the future. He also confirmed that Niantic's in-person events, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-fest-heads-to-paris-this-summer/1100-6529961/" data-ref-id="1100-6529961">Pokemon Go Fest</a>, will continue to be held. Steranka went on to explain that Scopely is very interested in examining why Pokemon Go remains popular, and wants to integrate some of the lessons from that into its own games.</p><p>For the immediate future, Steranka noted that he's currently planning the celebration of Pokemon Go's 10th anniversary, which will arrive in 2026.</p><p>"We've been planning on this for a long time, so I really want to make sure that next year is as big of a celebratory moment as possible for Pokemon Go," said Steranka. "And as you probably know, it's also the 30-year anniversary for Pokemon as a brand. So I think next year as a Pokemon fan, you are going to have just the best year of all time."</p><p>Fans won't have to wait that long for Pokemon's next game on Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> will arrive later this year, and Nintendo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-three-starters-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/1100-6529758/" data-ref-id="1100-6529758">unveiled a few of its starter Pokemon</a>.</p>
