                <p>Celeste developer Extremely Ok Games has announced that its next project, Earthblade, has been canceled. The decision was made back in December, but the the team said it needed to process the news before announcing it publicly.</p><p>Director Maddy Thorson provided more details in a <a href="https://exok.com/posts/2025-01-22-earthblade-final-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">final blog post</a>. One of the main reasons for the cancelation revolved around disagreements over the Celeste IP rights, the details of which the studio has decided not to disclose. While a resolution was reached, founding member Pedro Medeiros parted ways with Earthblade in <a href="https://x.com/saint11/status/1857481536335131092" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">November</a> and is now working on his own game, Neverway.</p><p>Medeiros's departure led Thorson and programmer Noel Berry to reevaluate Earthblade, which was still promising but not as far along considering its long development period.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298" data-ratio="0.96611445783133" data-width="1328" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432298"></a><figcaption>Thorson left a parting gift for Earthblade: its earliest piece of concept art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4432298-image_2025-01-22_165112344.png"></figure><p>"Celeste's success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with Earthblade, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting," Thorson explained. "Pedro isn't to blame for this--in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief."</p><p>The situation has caused other developers on Earthblade to leave as well, with both Thorson and Berry now working on smaller scale projects and prototyping again. Thorson admitted that scaling the team up after Celeste's success was a failure, but is hopeful that the studio will regain its footing and learn lessons from Earthblade's development.</p><p>Earthblade was first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-developers-reveal-new-exploration-action-game-earthblade/1100-6490315/" data-ref-id="1100-6490315">revealed back in 2021,</a> and was slated for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-developers-next-game-earthblade-delayed-out-of-this-year/1100-6522269/" data-ref-id="1100-6522269">2024 release</a>. However, it was delayed out of that year with no further updates until now.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the line between handheld and home consoles blurs there's been more of a need--and want--for docks that can bridge the gap between small and big screen gaming. For most people, it's an experience that is familiar thanks to the Switch, but these days it's not a feature exclusive to Nintendo's devices. Everything from beefy hardware like the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-extreme-gets-200-discount-comes-with-free-travel-case/1100-6524126/" data-ref-id="1100-6524126">Asus ROG Ally</a> to comparatively modestly powered emulation handhelds like Anbernic's various devices are capable of being plugged into a large screen for a more traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Docks, then, are almost essential these days. Beyond functionality, I look for the aesthetic advantage a dock can provide. I like my devices nicely placed and positioned as something that looks good in a room, instead of just hanging out near a power outlet while on charge. With that in mind, my docks of choice have always come from JSAUX, which offers the ability to turn the Steam Deck, Ally, and any other PC-handheld into something that can actually function as a computer. Along with a HDMI out and few USB ports to connect peripherals to, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JSAUX-Compatible-Ethernet-Charging-Deck-HB0603/dp/B0B7HVZNMB?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">JSAUX docks</a> include an ethernet port, making both working and gaming with good internet stability much more viable.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Handheld-Dock-Chroma-Connectivity-Passthrough/dp/B0DS4GDVW2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's Handheld Dock Chroma</a> isn't very different from these, despite being more expensive at $80. However, it does address a couple of key issues I always have with docks. The first of these is docks aren't typically very nice to look at and the second being the stability can often be an issue. Razer sent over a dock for testing; I've been using it for about a week and, as a whole, I'm impressed with it as an overall package. It doesn't do anything unique, but it does offer everything you would want and need from a hardware and connectivity standpoint while also being designed in a thoughtful way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432290"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Steam Deck</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432290-razerhandhelddockchroma.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432291,1300-4432292,1300-4432293,1300-4432294,1300-4432295,1300-4432296" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432291-razer_handheld_dock_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432292-razer_handheld_dock_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432293-razer_handheld_dock_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432294-razer_handheld_dock_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432295-razer_handheld_dock_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432296-razer_handheld_dock_6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First and foremost, those looking to use the Handheld Dock Chroma as more than just a charging device with HDMI out capabilities will be able to make the most of the three USB 3.2 and/or the USB Type C ports to plug in keyboard, mice, controllers or anything else that's required to make a PC-handheld function as a desktop computer. There's a HDMI port that supports 4K at 60hz for external screens, and a gigabit ethernet port. There's also 100w passthrough for power. Again, it's mostly standard features and available in both JSAUX's docks and Valve's official dock for Steam Deck.</p><p dir="ltr">However, where Razer's dock stands out is the mechanism used to hold devices in place. It's a back plate that covers the rear of most devices and provides good support and prevents any wobbling or tipping. This might sound like a simple thing that isn't really a big deal but, for me, I've always disliked the way the JSAUX and Valve docks I've used don't have a back and rely on how the base is shaped to keep devices in place. These all function perfectly fine for most people who don't really think about it, but I always felt my devices were somewhat precariously placed.</p><p dir="ltr">The back plate design Razer has used gives me much more confidence and, better still, it's adjustable so the angle at which your device is placed can be changed. The backplate can be raised and angled to fit into rubber grooves in the base to lend further stability, but also better accommodate a range of devices. Like other stands, the USB connector that plugs into your device has a goose neck design, so you're limited by how far it can extend, but most gaming devices, phones, and tablets should be able to settle in without issue. I have taken to positioning the back plate at its steepest angle and then placing my ROG Ally X on it for a viewing angle that is much more comfortable on a desk. Adjusting the placement also means that there's a variety of viewing angles available, which is handy if you want people to crowd around a single device for multiplayer (I ain't doing that).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289" data-ratio="0.41683501683502" data-width="1485" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4432289"></a><figcaption>Razer Handheld Dock Chroma with Asus ROG Ally</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4432289-razerhandhelddock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not in use, the back plate can be flattened horizontally to serve as a top surface, giving the dock a box-like form factor that makes it much easier to transport. While most docks are lightweight enough to throw in a bag and take with you, the flat, rectangular design makes it much easier to place in sleeves and pockets in bags without worrying if it's scratching something else or being crushed by other things. It also makes it easier to take out and put in. The aluminium chassis makes it feel lightweight and sturdy, and matte black texturing means it can easily blend into most setups. Of course, there's also a button that you can hit to activate and cycle through RGB lighting options on the bottom of the base. It's worth noting that the package only includes the dock--so it's up to you to provide the power source.</p><p dir="ltr">All that means that the Razer Handheld Dock is a dock that I feel good about having, instead of something that just does the job. It's a versatile, stylish, and sturdy dock that can be used with a variety of devices. It covers its bases by ensuring the hardware has what it needs to leverage the power of your devices for more than just gaming, should you want to, and it's easy to pick-up-and-go with. As previously mentioned, at $80 it's on the higher-end in terms of pricing--the official Steam Deck Dock is $79--but it justifies this with quality that is evident from the moment you take it out of the box.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><em>Disclosure: Razer provided the Handheld Chroma Dock to GameSpot for testing.</em></p>

The game invites players to spend real money on virtual Pokemon cards, although Pokemon TCG Pocket can also be played for free. However, at least one player has thrown the maximum amount of money at the game since its debut, and the result is an astounding collection of cards.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-player-shares-outcome-of-hitting-the-games-daily-spending-limit-every-day-since-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Japanese player Hajimesyacho has disclosed that they spent the daily limit on Pokemon TCG Pocket between October 30, 2024 and January 19, which led to over 50,000 cards in their virtual collection. </p><p>There is apparently a daily limit for spending real money in Pokemon TCG Pocket, which is approximately 14,000 yen/$120. If Hajimeshacho reached that limit from October 30-January 19, then he spent around 1.12 million yen/$7,155. That's a lot of money to invest in anything, much less virtual cards that don't exist on paper. Regardless, Hajimeshacho seems happy, and that's really all that matters.</p><p>But if there were ever any card Hajimeshacho needed to get from someone else, then they would probably be happy to hear that Pokemon TCG Pocket <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-finally-adding-a-trading-system/1100-6528883/" data-ref-id="1100-6528883">is getting a trading system</a>. That feature is supposed to be added to the game later this month. In other Pokemon news, the Japanese mob is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using Pokemon cards to launder money</a>. But that probably means that the virtual nature of Pokemon TCG Pocket will probably keep the mob from trying the same trick with that game.</p>
