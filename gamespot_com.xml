                <p dir="ltr">Today is Pokemon Day, the annual celebration of the original Pokemon games--Red and Green--releasing in Japan. With it comes a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/" data-ref-id="2900-6286">Pokemon Presents video</a>, and today's ended with a new look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with a release window of "late 2025."</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Z-A will take Trainers on a tour of Lumiose City, the bustling Paris-themed city from Pokemon X and Y's Kalos region, which in this game is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment" by a company called Quasartico for both people and Pokemon to enjoy. The city will feature multiple open areas for exploration, including rooftops--which players can jump off and glide back down to the ground--and Wild Zones where new Pokemon can be battled and caught.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_KNDtKJJ-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We see multiple Pokemon encounters during the trailer, some of which resemble the turn-based battling featured in many previous games, as well as the "throw a Poke Ball without battling" mechanic seen in Legends: Arceus. Along with those came a new type of battling system where distance and movement play a key role, as attack moves have a certain amount of reach, and moving a Pokemon out of the way will cause the attack to miss.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A will also mark the return of Mega Evolutions--which originated in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo DS. Multiple Mega Pokemon are shown in the trailer, including Mega Lucario, Mega Ampharos, and Mega Kangaskhan.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also introduced many of the characters inhabiting this version of Lumiose City, which include both new and returning faces. We see the player character's friends Urbain and Taunie, Quasartico CEO Jett and her bodyguard Vinnie, and the return of AZ--the mysterious former king of Kalos--as the owner of the hotel the player-characters stays in during the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends Z-A is the second installment of the Pokemon Legends franchise, as it follows 2022's Pokemon Legends: Arceus. It is scheduled to release in late 2025.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was a huge success for the company, and the franchise is coming back this year with potentially even more features that the studio didn't get into 2024's game.</p><p>EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p><p>For CFB 25, many people mentioned how the single-player career mode, Road to Glory, felt underwhelming, so that's one area that fans will hope to see expanded upon in 2025's game.</p><p>CFB 25 came to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but not PC. Sources told The Athletic that CFB 25 skipped PC due in part to how the game's primary audience is in North America, whereas launching on PC is more important for global releases. Holt said EA "started" with Xbox and PlayStation, but said, "We'll look at other opportunities, other platforms" for future releases.</p><p>EA never disclosed a sales number for CFB 25, but it was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US</a>, only eclipsed by Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. Holt said the game "outperformed all our expectations" and became "part of the cultural landscape of college football."</p><p>Another change for CFB 26 could be how much the student-athletes are paid to be part of it. The original deal for CFB 25 was a payment of $600 and a free copy of the game to more than 11,000 players, amounting to a total cost of more than $6 million for EA. Some players got more money for promoting the game. For CFB 26, a Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) company called Pathway Sports &amp; Entertainment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">attempting to sign players with $1,500 up front with the potential for a revenue-sharing deal as well</a> based on copies sold. EA has not commented on Pathway's proposed plans.</p>

                <p>Capcom has revealed the release window of Title Update 1 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and teased some of what players can expect from it. Specifically, it looks like more content is coming to the game for players who beat the story and want more of a challenge.</p><p>Title Update 1 will come out in early April, placing its launch over a month after the base game's release. That might seem like a big gap between launch and the first update, but the official Monster Hunter X account explains that Capcom wanted to "give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them!" Capcom had previously teased this update with a vague Spring 2025 release window <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">during a State of Play</a> earlier this month.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1895092830176952494" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Title Update 1 – Release Date!</p><p> We’re pleased to confirm that TU1 for Monster Hunter Wilds will arrive in early April! <br>This will give hunters enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges, that await them! <a href="https://t.co/xbbPY2z5B9" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xbbPY2z5B9</a></p></div>  — Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1895092830176952494?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While Monster Hunter Wilds is one of the most approachable games in the series yet, Capcom will also add more-difficult monsters in TItle Update 1. There will be two new monsters for players to hunt, including one with strength "at a level above Tempered." During the State of Play, it was confirmed that Mizutsune from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-generations/" data-ref-id="5000-433646">Monster Hunter Generations</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a> will be one of these monsters.</p><p>Capcom also <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1895097872502190478" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased on X</a> that this update will add "a new place to communicate, have meals together, and more with other hunters," although it clarified that players will have to complete Monster Hunter Wilds' story before they can access this. With this addition and those tough new monsters, Title Update 1 looks like it will strengthen the endgame of Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p>You can start playing the game and preparing for Title Update 1 yourself when Monster Hunter Wilds launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S tomorrow, February 28.</p>
