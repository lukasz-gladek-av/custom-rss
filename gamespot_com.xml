                <p>The Xbox brand is having an interesting year so far, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-3-million-players-right-away-and-the-majority-of-them-are-on-game-pass-apparently/1100-6531702/" data-ref-id="1100-6531702">hot launch of Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and several Microsoft-published games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">finding success on PlayStation</a>. The future of Xbox is uncertain, but the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, scheduled for Sunday, June 8, should give us an idea of what's coming soon from Microsoft's first-party studios and its partners.</p><p>The showcase, which streams a couple days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>, will have a Direct presentation devoted to Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming RPG The Outer Worlds 2 immediately following it. Previous Xbox summer showcases in 2023 and 2024 have featured extended looks at Starfield and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, respectively, as closers.</p><h2>How to watch the Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExsVDr2CU40" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExsVDr2CU40" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>You can stream the Xbox Games Showcase and the following Direct for The Outer Worlds 2 on GameSpot's YouTube, as well as the official Xbox </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a><span> pages. Bethesda is also hosting the presentation on its </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span> and </span><a href="http://twitch.tv/Bethesda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a><span> channels, as is Obsidian Entertainment on </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/ObsidianEnt" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a><span>. The YouTube streams will be in 4K resolution at 60fps. And in a first, Xbox is also streaming the event on </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a><span>, featuring live commentary from host Ethan Rothamel and TikTok creator Senpapi Gabe.</span></p><h2>Xbox Games Showcase and The Outer Worlds 2 Direct start time</h2><p>The Xbox Games Showcase begins at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Sunday, June 8. The Outer Worlds 2 Direct starts immediately after the showcase concludes. Microsoft has not specified the duration of the presentation, but previous Xbox showcases have typically lasted around an hour, followed by a 30- to 45-minute Direct for a featured game.</p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>6 PM BST</li><li>3 AM AET (June 9)</li></ul><h2>What to expect</h2><p>Besides The Outer Worlds 2, the Xbox team hasn't explicitly mentioned any other titles that will appear in the showcase. However, the studios under the Microsoft Gaming umbrella have several anticipated titles in development that we are aware of, which we could see this year.</p><p>Previous showcases have given us peeks at Gears of War: E-Day and a Perfect Dark reboot, and this showcase would be a perfect opportunity to reveal launch dates for both. And while the new Fable game from Playground Games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">pushed back to 2026</a>, the showcase could still provide us with some new gameplay footage.</p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-soon/1100-6531706/" data-ref-id="1100-6531706">getting a free update this summer</a>, so it's also possible that studio Ninja Theory will detail when it drops and what's included. The highly acclaimed Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is also getting story DLC this year, titled The Order of Giants, so it would be unsurprising to see a trailer and release date for it at this showcase.</p><p>On the Activision Blizzard side, there still hasn't been an official announcement on what this year's Call of Duty game will be, though it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">rumored to be a new Black Ops game</a> set in the future--a reveal could come at the showcase.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/herdling/" data-ref-id="5000-640542">Herdling</a>, the next game from the Far: Lone Sails team, Okomotive, is coming this summer to consoles and PC, but you don't have to wait any longer to play a portion of it yourself. The free Herdling demo is out now on Steam, as was just announced alongside a new gameplay trailer during the Future Games Show.</p><p dir="ltr">In Herdling, players control a nameless child who takes on the responsibility of herding a pack of fantastical mammoth-like creatures, called calicorns, to their home. Players must guide them to safety and will benefit from their help in puzzles. The trick will frequently be getting the calicorns from A to B without losing any to narrow passageways, train tracks, and other (sometimes deadly) obstacles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPaS2fmFEAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KPaS2fmFEAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">I played an early portion of the game at PAX West last year and have since been anticipating it hitting me like a ton of bricks when it arrives in full--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-love-for-incredibly-sad-games-has-me-very-excited-for-herdling/1100-6529824/">in a bittersweet way that I appreciate, mind you</a>. It's going to be sad, no doubt, but if there <em>is</em> a way to play it without losing any furry friends, you can bet I'll be trying to find it. It reminds me of Journey in that the objective is a mountain far off in the distance, and getting there is a road trip of beautiful music to listen to and sights to see.</p><p dir="ltr">You can download the free Herdling demo here. It's unclear if the demo will stay on Steam or disappear after a time, so if you're interested, don't hesitate. Herdling comes to Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, and PS5 this summer.</p>
