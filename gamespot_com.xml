                <p>Blue Prince from Dogubomb and Raw Fury has emerged as the highest-rated game of 2025 thus far on GameSpot sister site Metacritic.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a>, players explore a manor with shifting rooms. In practice, players must navigate this manor, solving the puzzles within each room before deciding which one to go into next. It has a roguelike structure, so the rooms within the manor reset each day and can slowly be upgraded over time depending on the player's actions. You might not have heard of Blue Prince before because it's an indie first-person puzzle game. That said, critics love its experimental structure and are heaping it with praise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Goj5usM4tGM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Goj5usM4tGM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had," GameSpot's Steve Watts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-prince-review-an-intricate-layered-roguelike-puzzle/1900-6418355/" data-ref-id="1900-6418355">wrote in a glowing review</a>. "It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric. Like each of my dozens of permutations of the Mount Holly manor house itself, it is truly one of a kind."</p><p>Blue Prince currently sits at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/blue-prince/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">92 on Metacritic</a>, making its aggregate score the highest of 2025. It dethroned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, which currently has an aggregate score of 91. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-roottrees-are-dead-2023/" data-ref-id="5000-664554">The Roottrees are Dead</a> round out Metacritic's top five <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-reviewed games of the year</a> so far. That's some impressive company Blue Prince finds itself in, and suggests it will be this year's indie darling, just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was last year.</p><p>Blue Prince isn't out yet, and if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you won't even have to pay for it when it launches. It will be released on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on April 10, and it will be available as part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has said that Switch 2's eShop won't have any theme music, just like the first Switch didn't, as a result of not wanting to disrupt the user experience.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said, "Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games." Before the Switch, systems like Wii and Wii U had music themes playing as users browsed their respective eShops. "We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there."</p><p>Kawamoto added that he wanted to make sure that browsing the Switch 2 eShop was a smooth experience, that the list doesn't stall, and that pages load fast. Due to those factors, the eShop won't have any theme music.</p><p>He also admitted that he booted up the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any other application on the Wii system. The Wii Shopping channel is known for its catchy theme, and it's so popular that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-labo-players-cover-wii-shop-music-and-bil/1100-6458475/" data-ref-id="1100-6458475">players created covers of it in Nintendo Labo</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, some Nintendo Labo kits are one of the few games that aren't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatible</a> on Switch 2. More specifically, it's the Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This kit requires players to insert the Switch tablet into the Toy-Con device. Since the Switch 2 tablet is larger than the original Switch, it won't fit.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Direct</a> last week, tons of new info dropped. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">defended Mario Kart World's staggering $80 price tag</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649">Switch 2 carts still taste bad</a>, just like the carts of the first Switch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launches on June 5.</p>
