                <p>One of Microsoft's next big games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a>. From developer Obsidian, the RPG is set for release on October 29, but it's playable five days earlier for people who pay extra. The early-access and global release times have now been revealed, so you can find out exactly when you can start playing.</p><p>The early-access launch starts at midnight Eastern on October 24, which works out to 9 PM PT on October 23. As for the full global launch, that begins on October 29 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. You can see a full breakdown of the launch times below, as shared by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-global-release-times-confirmed-including-early-access" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><h2>The Outer Worlds 2 early access launch times</h2><h3>Thursday, October 23, 2025</h3><ul><li>9 PM PT</li></ul><h3>Friday, October 24, 2025</h3><ul><li>12 AM ET</li><li>5 AM BST</li><li>6 AM CEST</li></ul><ul><li>7 AM EEST</li><li>12 PM HKT</li><li>1 PM JST</li><li>3 PM AEST</li></ul><h2>The Outer Worlds 2 public launch times</h2><h3>Wednesday, October 29, 2025</h3><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>5 PM BST</li><li>6 PM CEST</li><li>8 PM EEST</li></ul><h3>Thursday, October 30, 2025</h3><ul><li>1 AM HKT</li><li>2 AM JST</li><li>4 AM AEST</li></ul><h2><strong>Preorder The Outer Worlds 2</strong></h2><p>The Outer Worlds 2 is available to preorder now on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. You can get the standard edition for $70 or the Premium edition for $100. The latter includes a variety of extras, along with a Season Pass that comes with two story expansions to come later. The Premium edition also unlocks up to five days early, beginning on October 24.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 is available with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as well. Subscribers to Game Pass Ultimate can upgrade to the Premium edition for $30. Be sure to consult GameSpot's The Outer Worlds 2 preorder guide to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access/1100-6532295/" data-ref-id="1100-6532295">see all the preorder bonuses and more.</a></p><h2 dir="ltr">The Outer Worlds 2 was supposed to be $80</h2><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft said it was raising prices on some of its 2025 new releases from $70 to $80, noting that The Outer Worlds 2 would kick things off at the higher price point. However, the company later<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374"> backtracked and announced the game would stay at $70</a>. The game's $100 Premium edition did not go down in price. With The Outer Worlds 2 no longer retailing for $80, that makes Nintendo's Mario Kart World the only major new release from a big publisher going for $80 this year.</p>

                <p>Released in 2011, Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim was a success at launch and continued to grow in popularity over the years. It's now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as the No. 8 best-selling game in history.</a> Why has the game had such enduring appeal? Lead designer Bruce Nesmith said on the <a href="https://linktr.ee/frvrpodcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FRVR Podcast</a> that the game's open-world design was done in a way that "nobody had ever done before" and that only "very few" games have tried to do since.</p><p>"By all rights, a year later, some other game should have eclipsed it. And then two years later, three years later, five, 10. It's like, 'What the hell is going on here?'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-lead-designer-is-eternally-shocked-at-the-games-lasting-appeal-saying-i-think-skyrim-did-open-world-in-a-way-that-nobody-had-ever-done-before" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><p>Nesmith, who has since left Bethesda, said he remembers when Bethesda boss Todd Howard--who directed Skyrim--would host in meetings in which he would tell staff about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">how wildly popular the game continued to be some 10 years after launch.</a></p><p>Nesmith went on to say that Bethesda accepted that Skyrim would have bugs and quirks, and fans did too. "You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond," he said.</p><p>Before this, Howard said of Skyrim's ongoing appeal and all the subsequent re-releases for new platforms: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/millions-still-play-skyrim-every-month-todd-howard/1100-6460286/" data-ref-id="1100-6460286">"If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it."</a> It's become something of a joke that Bethesda will release the game on any and all platforms, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-jokes-about-skyrim-on-amazon-alex/1100-6459648/" data-ref-id="1100-6459648">including Alexa devices. </a></p><p>Bethesda is now developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, but it's likely still a long time off. The company is also developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5.</a></p>

The global launch times for the upcoming Switch exclusive have now been posted.</p><p>The game launches on October 16 at midnight Eastern, which works out to 9 PM PT and 11 PM CST on Wednesday, October 15. You can see the full release times below, as posted by<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-global-release-times-confirmed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> IGN.</a></p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Z-A release times:</h2><h3>Wednesday, October 15, 2025</h3><ul><li>9 PM PT</li><li>11 PM CST</li></ul><h3>Thursday, October 16, 2025</h3><ul><li>12 AM for everywhere else in the world</li></ul><h2><strong>Preloading and preorder info</strong></h2><p>Preloading for Pokemon Legends: Z-A is now available for people who acquired a copy from the Nintendo eShop. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-za-release-time-date-edt-pdt-preload-preorder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Polygon</a>, it requires 4GB of space on Switch 1 and 7.7GB of space on Switch 2.

The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1148917741" data-promo-id="0"
