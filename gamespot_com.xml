However, Capcom's franchise has hit some serious turbulence in the form of declining sales, which may be why the publisher is releasing Monster Hunter Wilds' expansion sooner than expected.</p><p>Capcom has moved up the release of Wilds' expansion from the end of September to August 13. This update will introduce a new level of difficulty, a new rewards system, adjustments to weapons balance, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021<br>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p>  — Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Capcom has also shared its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly report for investors</a>, and the numbers aren't good for Monster Hunter Wilds. Between April 1 and June 30, Wilds sold only 477k copies, which was only slightly above its predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, with 389k copies. Even Devil May Cry 5 outsold Monster Hunter Wilds in that period, with 1,782,000 copies. The high number for that game may be due to the Netflix anime adaptation.</p><p>According to Capcom's report, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10,585,000 copies since its release earlier this year. There have been signs that players weren't satisfied with Wilds, especially the PC port. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/" data-ref-id="1100-6532587">Monster Hunter World had more Steam players than Wilds</a> earlier this summer. Players also left a large number of negative reviews on Steam over Wilds' performance issues and lack of endgame content.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sees-huge-jump-in-pc-players-after-free-title-update-2/1100-6532910/" data-ref-id="1100-6532910">experienced an increase in players on Steam</a> after Capcom's most recent major update, but not all of the game's issues were addressed. It remains to be seen if the new expansion will turn things around for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
