                <p>While you might be looking to reestablish your gym routine now that the festive season is over, at least you can count on your Switch 2 console having an extra layer of stability thanks to a new firmware update. Nintendo has rolled out a new system update for the Switch 2 that brings it up to version 21.2.0, and as you've probably guessed, it doesn't do much.</p><p>"General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience," the very succinct <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update notes</a> read.</p><p>Since its launch, the Switch 2 has mostly focused on small updates like this to keep the console running smoothly for users. That's not to say there haven't been any substantial updates so far, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-and-switch-get-new-system-updates-and-they-add-more-than-just-stability/1100-6536122/">November firmware upgrade</a> added better visual clarity on the home menu to indicate whether a game is owned physically or digitally.
