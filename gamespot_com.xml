                <p>In just over a month, players will have a better idea of what to expect from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> when it's showcased during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>. Because Nintendo had to share certain technical specs with the Federal Communication Commission ahead of time, players are now privy to a few additional details about the upcoming console.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/625931/nintendo-switch-2-fcc-nfc-wi-fi-6-usb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the FCC has <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=eI2H2dVQ5qDgaEf8hlh%2FwQ%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKEBEE001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted some of the Switch 2 technical specs</a> online. While most of these reports are very dry with technical jargon, they do indicate that Switch 2 will support near field communication, or NFC, which is how the Amiibo figures were able to connect with Nintendo's previous console to unlock new in-game content. It's also been confirmed that the radio-frequency identification (RFID) feature is located in the right Joy-Con, just as it was in the first Switch. While that's not 100% confirmation that Amiibos will continue to be utilized with the Switch 2, it certainly seems likely that they will. </p><p>The FCC filings indicate that Switch 2 will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth. That's an upgrade from the original Switch's Wi-Fi 5 capabilities, but not as fast as Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. These reports also confirm that Switch 2 has two USB-C ports, one at the top and one at the bottom. The system can be charged through either of those ports.</p><p>A previously released Japanese patent application revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-patent-application-seems-to-confirm-switch-2-joy-con-feature/1100-6529310/" data-ref-id="1100-6529310">Switch 2's Joy-Cons will have mouse-like capabilities</a>. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa recently suggested the company must push "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-switch-2-coming-nintendo-explains-why-it-must-go-beyond-traditional-games/1100-6529363/" data-ref-id="1100-6529363">beyond video games</a>" to get people to engage with more than just its games and consoles. It's not entirely clear what that means for Switch 2 yet, but hopefully more answers will be shared soon.</p>
