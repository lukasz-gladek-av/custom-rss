                <p>Real-time-strategy games still have a dedicated audience, but these days, the focus seems to mostly be on the competitive side. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-coming-next-year-to-pc/1100-6534085/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4</a> developer King Art Games is bucking that trend, as the studio behind Iron Harvest wants to prioritize the single-player campaign over multiplayer, returning to the roots of what made Dawn of War--and several other popular RTS games--so popular in the first place.</p><p>"We are known for making narrative-driven games, and the campaign for Iron Harvest was very well received," game director Jan Theysen said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/dawn-of-war-4-developer-king-art-knows-what-you-all-really-want-overwhelmingly-its-singleplayer-content-and-the-campaign/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>. "So for us, this was super clear: campaigns will be one of the big pillars for the game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dawn of War 4 Wants To Revitalize The RTS Genre and I think it can</p>
      </div>
<p>Dawn of War 4 will feature not one but four campaigns when it launches. The Space Marine, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus will headline their own series of missions, and each one of these groups bring unique units, buildings, and advantages to the battlefield.</p><p>The combined campaigns will feature over 70 missions, and the story is being co-written by Warhammer 40: Black Library author John French. Theysen added that multiplayer won't be forgotten and is being worked on, but the studio is primarily focused on crafting a single-player campaign that evokes a sensation of stepping back into the golden age of RTS games. "What we look most fondly back on when playing RTS games when we were all younger, or how that shaped our tastes in the genre, the single-player campaigns were one of the things that stuck the longest with us," Theysen added.</p><p>In addition to the single-player campaign, the game will also feature Last Stand and Skirmish modes alongside 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3 multiplayer when it launches in 2026 for PC. In related news, Amazon's Warhammer 40,000 live-action adaptation--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/">with Superman actor Henry Cavill attached in a starring role</a>--is continuing at a steady pace, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-40k-show-is-likely-still-years-away/1100-6533551/">but it's still years away from making its TV debut</a>.</p>

                <p>Season 10 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Festival is starting on August 26, and that means a new headlining artist--Gorillaz--a new music pass with paid and <em>free</em> items, and the first major update for the Festival mode in a couple months. Say goodbye to outgoing headliner Bruno Mars, and say hello to 2D, Noodle, Russel, and Murdoc. This is the first time aside from Metallica last summer that the Festival headliner has been a group rather than an individual, and Epic is handling the Gorillaz a little bit differently than they did those elder statesmen of metal.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gorillaz in the Fortnite item shop</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555027"></a><figcaption>This bundle of Gorillaz cosmetics will be in the Fortnite shop all season long.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555027-fest_10_gorillaz_itemshop_2dnoodle_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>When Metallica was the headlining artist, there were skins for each member in both the shop and in the music pass. With Gorillaz, the four fictional, cartoon members of the group are split between the pass and the item shop, and it's 2D and Noodle who will be on shop duty throughout Season 10. Naturally, all the Gorillaz skins are cel shaded.</p><p dir="ltr">Those two brought some stuff with them, of course, as they each have a back bling and musical instrument: a mic stand for 2D and a guitar for Noodle. The selection of shop stuff is rounded out by a camo wrap, a contrail, a jam track for the song Clint Eastwood, and both an emote and a jam track for the song Dare. Everything listed in this paragraph, <em>except for the Clint Eastwood jam track,</em> is included in one big ole bundle, but you'll also be able to buy everything individually if you only want one or two things.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gorillaz music pass</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555028"></a><figcaption>The Russel skin unlocks instantly when you purchase the Gorillaz music pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555028-fest_10_gorillaz_musicpass_outfit_russel_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>The rest of the Gorillaz cosmetics can be found on the new music pass, which costs 1400 V-Bucks and is included with a Fortnite Crew subscription. Buying the pass immediately unlocks the Russel skin, and progressing through the pass by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode will unlock a series of other cosmetics--with the Murdoc skin coming at the end. Along the way you can also unlock back blings, instruments--Russel's drums and Murdoc's bass--and four licensed jam tracks:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>On Melancholy Hill</strong> by Gorillaz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Interstate Love Song</strong> by Stone Temple Pilots</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Run It Up</strong> by Hanumankind</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Montagem Tomada</strong> by MXZI</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">Free stuff!</h2><p dir="ltr">As is Fortnite tradition, there's a decent bounty of free stuff on the new music pass as well, like a keytar, an additional drum kit, an aura, and four new Epic-produced jam tracks, including the full version of the song from <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=3918" rel="nofollow ">this emote</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Festival updates</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555029"></a><figcaption>The new Gorillaz-themed Festival Main Stage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4555029-fest_10_gorillaz_newstagereveal_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Epic rarely makes major changes to the Festival mode during each season, and so for fans of the rhythm game, the beginning of a new season is an exciting time because this is when we get quality-of-life improvements. For Season 10, we've got several small but fundamental changes that address some specific complaints.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">They redesigned the look of lift notes in hopes that it will make them easier to read for folks who struggle with them. This change can be toggled in settings if you don't like the new look.</li><li dir="ltr">They added a "Good" popup for when you miss the center of the note to go along with the existing "Perfect" popup, to make it easier to track those in your peripheral vision.</li><li dir="ltr">You can sort by length and difficulty when browsing songs on the Main Stage.</li><li dir="ltr">Folks with guitar controllers and other non-gamepad devices can now strum when they calibrate using the in-game "tuneup" tool.</li></ul><p>The Festival Main Stage got a makeover, too, as you can see above.</p><h2 dir="ltr">A tease for next season</h2><p dir="ltr">In a surprising move, Epic's announcement for Season 10 also included a tease for what comes next, which it described as a "celebration" of Festival with "Fortnite-original rewards and awesome music." That could very well mean it won't have a headlining artist like Gorillaz or Bruno Mars, and Epic wants to mentally prime us for that in advance.</p>

                <p><em>Until Dawn is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, August 25, 2025. Below, we explore the fascinating legacy and origin of a classic horror game.</em></p><p>Video games are an incredible medium for horror stories. Some of the greatest games of all time are firmly planted in the horror genre. While games such as Resident Evil and Silent Hill showed audiences the importance of tension in gameplay, the advancement in gaming technology allowed for more cinematic experiences in gameplay design and storytelling.</p><p>In 2015, one of the best examples of horror storytelling in gaming was released and left a lasting legacy that can be felt to this very day. That game was Until Dawn.</p><p>Developed by British developer Supermassive Games, Until Dawn actually started life as a game for Sony's scarcely supported PlayStation 3 peripheral: the Playstation Move. Supermassive sought to create the experience of living through a slasher film and designed the game to appeal to couples in their early 20's, promising a game that would deliver the blood, guts, and scares that come with slasher films.</p><p>This early version of the game had players controlling on-screen flashlights from a first-person perspective, guiding their characters through dark environments and interacting with objects with the motion controls to progress the game. The version of the game did not make it out of alpha testing, and Supermassive went back to the drawing board.</p><p>When Until Dawn finally reemerged, it was a title for the newly released PlayStation 4. Gone were the first-person perspective and motion controls. They were replaced by fixed, cinematic camera angles and more interactive gameplay design, akin to the works of Quantic Dream like Heavy Rain and Detroit: Become Human. Supermassive also made the transition to the Decima engine, a proprietary PlayStation engine that would eventually power games such as Horizon Zero Dawn and Death Stranding, that would help provide photorealistic graphics. Until Dawn went from being a title that potentially would not have found an audience due to requiring a motion peripheral to a game that would provide a more loving tribute to horror films that could be played using just the controller.</p><p>With this change in direction, the game was entirely recast with actors whose likenesses were used in the game, including Academy Award winner Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere (Scream 4 and 6), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, John Wick: Chapter 2), among many others. Supermassive tapped writers Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick, known for their work in horror films, to pen the script, providing an even deeper layer of authenticity to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694" data-ratio="0.56279988710133" data-width="3543" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554694"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn (2015)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554694-2359174350-29263.jpg"></figure><p>Until Dawn's story starts off as a treasure trove of slasher tropes and eventually evolves into something far more sinister and supernatural. Characters begin as one-note cliches and archetypes and eventually blossom into fleshed-out people with meaningful relationships. Thanks to that strong writing, it's devastating when one accidentally dies due to a bad decision by the player. While most horror games of the era emphasized action, Until Dawn provided players with a sense of dread and a fear of the unknown unlike anything else at the time.</p><p>Until Dawn ended up being more of a movie-like experience that let player's' decisions affect the ultimate outcome of the story. The game featured a "butterfly effect" mechanic that showed players the exact moment one of their decisions or a character's death affected the story and helped incentivize repeat playthroughs to see the other possible narrative paths. Until Dawn also held onto some of its roots as a PlayStation Move title, DualShock 4 controller's motion control capabilities, and even included a "Don't Move" mechanic that asked players to hold their controllers as still as possible to determine certain outcomes and fates.</p><p>Until Dawn was a massive success both critically and commercially. It helped turn Supermassive into a reliable source for interactive horror experiences and the studio went on to make more cinematic games, such as The Dark Pictures Anthology and The Quarry, but none of these titles ever quite reached the high bar set by Until Dawn.</p><p>Supermassive revisited the Until Dawn universe with the virtual reality games Until Dawn: Rush of Blood and The Inpatient, the latter of which was set around 60 years before the original game and brought back Fesseden and Reznick as writers.</p><p>Until Dawn would receive the full remake treatment in 2024 when Sony announced a version for the PS5. The remake, developed by Ballistic Moon (which was founded by former Supermassive employees), features a new third-person camera angle, a new musical score, and extended prologues and new endings. One of those endings is open-natured retconning the original's conclusions, implying that a direct sequel to Until Dawn could one day be possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554695"></a><figcaption>Until Dawn's remake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4554695-untildawnremake.jpg"></figure><p>But the remake was not received well. It featured a myriad of performance issues, minimal improvements over the PS4 original, and felt unnecessary overall, when the original still holds up to this day.</p><p>Until Dawn's legacy would come full circle in 2025, when Sony released a film adaptation of the game. There was speculation when the film was announced about how exactly the movie would adapt the game, since a prime part of Until Dawn's storytelling was the possibility for narrative branching based on the player's decisions and their success or failure in gameplay at key moments. Would the film adapt a "canon" version of the game's story? Would it reuse the same actors? Would it be a secret project connecting to the recently released remake?</p><p>The answer, it turned out, was none of the above. Instead, the movie Until Dawn tells a wholly original story that pays tribute to video games in numerous respects. The film tells the story of Clover (Ella Rubin) and her friends travelling to a mysterious cabin in search of her missing sister. While there, they encounter numerous threats, and every time the characters are killed, the day resets, trapping them in a time loop.</p><p>Facing a new threat every night, the group realizes the only way to break the loop is to survive until dawn. While the film features some tributes to the original game (and even features Stormare reprising his role), it ultimately ends up a mishmash of ideas and cliches that fail to capture the experience of the game.</p><p>That is perhaps what's most fascinating about the legacy of Until Dawn: It's a video game inspired by horror films that spawned a horror film inspired by video games. What started off as a PlayStation Move game took on a whole new life and cemented its legacy not only in video games but the horror genre in general.</p><p>While numerous attempts have been made to recapture the magic of the original game, none have reached the high levels of sincerity, rich storytelling, and gameplay that Until Dawn delivered. A decade later, Until Dawn remains one of the definitive horror gaming experiences.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic has announced some big changes to the mobile game, as starting in October, progression is being completely overhauled. Not only is the level cap being raised substantially from 50 to 80, but players can also expect several other changes geared toward making progression feel more meaningful with new rewards and cosmetics.</p><p>The update will go live on October 15, and existing players will have their levels determined based on their total earned XP to date. <a href="http://pokemongo.com/en/post/pgo-leveling-update-announce-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Niantic says</a> no player will go down a level and there'll also be a limited-time update with XP bonuses and a Timed Research event. Here's a breakdown of all the changes:</p><ul><li>Level cap increases from 50 to 80</li><li>Tasks for Level-Up Research for levels 41 to 50 will be removed</li><li>New Level-Up Research tasks will be added to levels 71 to 80</li><li>Players at level 70 and higher will have an increased chance of becoming Lucky Friends with other players</li><li>New rewards will be added to level-up progression, like increased storage capacity for Pokemon, items, and gifts.</li><li>New avatar items can be earned starting at level 25</li></ul><p>Players who experience a jump up in level will receive rewards associated with reaching those levels at that time, and Niantic will share details on these at a later date. Before the update goes live, players can also earn new cosmetics by reaching levels 40 through 50. The items include a Level 50 Jacket and an all-new avatar pose, and these will not be available once the leveling overhaul is implemented. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4555893"></a><figcaption>You only have until October 14 to get these Pokemon Go prizes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4555893-poke-go-prizes.jpg"></figure><p>From now until October 14, several bonuses will be available to help players level up more quickly in Pokemon Go. These include:</p><ul><li>2 × Catch XP from Nice, Great, and Excellent throws</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning raids</li><li>+3,000 XP from winning Max Battles</li></ul><p>Time Research quests that can net up to 7 million additional XP. Additionally, an existing level 47 Level-Up Research task will be changed so it's easier to complete; rather than exploring 25km eight times in a week, the task only asks you to do so twice.</p><p>In case you missed it, the final month of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-events-raid-bosses-spotlight-hours-community-day/1100-6533384/">Pokemon Go's Delightful Days season is almost over</a>.

<p>Nintendo hosting a Nintendo Direct in September would not be surprising at all given Nintendo historically hosts Direct events in September. Regarding the potential September 12 date, that timing is conspicuous given it is one day before the 40th anniversary of the release of 1985's original Super Mario Bros.</p><p>As for what Nintendo may have to show or discuss at a potential Nintendo Direct in September, people are speculating that the company may finally reveal the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-is-still-scheduled-to-launch-within-the-next-150-days/1100-6533663/" data-ref-id="1100-6533663">confirmed for release in 2025</a> but doesn't have a specific date on the calendar yet.</p><p>It is one of the Switch 2's big games coming in 2025, alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> on October 15. Many have been expecting Nintendo to share more information about the inevitable next 3D Mario game, but as of yet, there is nothing to suggest an announcement will come in September.</p><p>A Nintendo Direct in September could help Nintendo set the stage for the all-important holiday shopping season and help give people further reason to buy a Switch 2. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">Switch 2 got off to a hot start upon launch in June</a>, experts said early sales were always going to be strong due to pent-up demand and how the enthusiast crowd is not as price-sensitive. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-was-not-an-issue-at-launch-but-next-test-is-this-holiday-analyst-says/1100-6533403/" data-ref-id="1100-6533403">"next test" for the Switch 2</a>, some have said, will be how the console performs during the holidays with the mass-market consumer.</p><p>The latest Nintendo Direct took place on August 19 and it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/" data-ref-id="2900-6889">beefy broadcast focused exclusively on Kirby: Air Riders.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-hikes-announced-for-the-us-every-system-going-up-by-50/1100-6534127/" data-ref-id="1100-6534127">Microsoft and Sony have raised console prices this year</a> due in part to US President Donald Trump's tariffs, but Nintendo is keeping the Switch 2 at $450 or $500 for the Mario Kart World bundle. However, one industry expert said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">Nintendo could raise the price of the Switch 2 in 2026.</a> Nintendo itself, meanwhile, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">cannot rule out a price hike for the Switch 2.</a></p><p>Nintendo has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-increasing-price-of-switch-and-other-devices-in-the-us/1100-6533633/" data-ref-id="1100-6533633">raised prices on the original Switch and some Switch 2 accessories</a> due to market factors.</p>

                <p>Last year, Coffee Stain Studios brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/satisfactory/" data-ref-id="5000-483395">Satisfactory</a> out of its half decade in early access with an announcement <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-is-now-in-the-works-for-consoles-following-1-0-launch-on-pc/1100-6526360/" data-ref-id="1100-6526360">that console versions would follow</a>. Now, the studio is inviting players on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S to join PC players on planet MASSAGE-2(A-B)b when Satisfactory launches on consoles on November 4.</p><p>In Satisfactory, players assume control of Pioneers who have traveled to an alien world on behalf of the mega corporation FICSIT Inc. to build factories and exploit the natural resources of MASSAGE-2 (A-B)b. You'll construct increasingly elaborate sets of automated machinery to mine, craft, and expand.</p><p>It's a big job, but luckily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a> is supported across all consoles and PC, and up to four players can work together via co-op.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TURoNOy6eC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TURoNOy6eC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The console versions of Satisfactory will launch with everything in the PC version up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/satisfactory-gets-a-1-0-release-and-flushable-toilets-in-september/1100-6524709/" data-ref-id="1100-6524709">the 1.1 update that debuted in June</a>. For example, the toilets will be flushable from the very beginning. The Xbox version supports game suspend, while on PlayStation, there is support for the integrated controller speaker support and haptics. There will also be performance presets, including Quality mode target at 30fps, Balanced at 40fps, and Performance at 60fps. Additionally, players can utilize cloud saves to take their assembled factories across consoles or PC, depending on which platform they choose to use.</p><p>Satisfactory isn't the only factory simulation game that's set on an alien world. Earlier this summer, developer Creepy Jar shared a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starrupture/" data-ref-id="5000-590982">StarRupture</a>, a game that seems very similar to Satisfactory, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starrupture-early-access-trailer-looks-more-dangerous-than-satisfactory/1100-6534020/" data-ref-id="1100-6534020">also more dangerous</a>. The alien inhabitants in this game appear to be very lethal. StarRupture will debut in early access on January 6, 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Horizon 5 - Horizon Realms Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Earlier this month, an Australian car import company uploaded an Instagram post showing off a Playground Games employee digitally scanning a rare compact Japanese car, adding more fuel to the fire when the post mentioned that it was for a new Forza Horizon game. The Tokyo Game Show takes place September 25-28, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5799/" data-ref-id="2900-5799">Microsoft has in the past held dedicated showcases</a> during the event.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-horizon-5-review-its-about-four-wheeled-family/1900-6417778/">Forza Horizon 5 launched back in 2021</a>, and it saw the game's titular festival move to Mexico and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">the best-selling game on PS5 this year, per gaming analyst Alinea</a>. The game was well-reviewed and featured hundreds of vehicles to collect with frequent content updates, eventually <a href="https://x.com/GAMERNEWSonX/status/1958214507739922667" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reaching 50 million players across all platforms</a>.</p><p>Recently, the cadence of those updates has slowed down, leading many to suspect that developer Playground Games was gearing up for a sequel, in addition to its work on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-4-everything-we-know/1100-6485774/" data-ref-id="1100-6485774">next Fable game</a>. Japan has been a frequently requested location for a Forza Horizon game to take place in, as the country has a rich history and appreciation for car culture, car meets, and an infamous underground racing scene.</p><p>The rumors come after numerous layoffs and the cancellation of several games at Microsoft's game studios, and Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 was hit particularly bad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">with reportedly 50% of its staff affected</a>. The studio says that it still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-studio-turn-10-breaks-month-long-silence-on-its-future-following-recent-layoffs/1100-6533793/">plans to support the more-realistic counterpart to Forza Horizon</a>, with several events for the game having already kicked off recently.</p>
