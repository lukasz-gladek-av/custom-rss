Back as f**k" in regards to the Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal trailer. He clarified in another post that it's <a href="https://twitter.com/locust9/status/1950990958914363485" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too soon to say</a> if Battlefield 6 will indeed be the return to form that it may appear to be. "For sure, we are not back until, you know, we can verify firsthand. But optically, we are back," he said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Battlefield series is known for destructive environments and combined-arms combat across large-scale maps, but for the first time in several years, Battlefield 6 returns the franchise to the modern era for an entry that has the potential to be a proper successor to Battlefield 3 and 4. Major environmental destruction is back, and the game steps away from the unpopular specialist operators of Battlefield 2042 in favor of the more traditional class system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We loved Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and we wanted Battlefield 6 to be inspired by that," VP and executive producer Christian Grass said when discussing the studio's focus for the game. "We wanted to make sure we nailed the tactical destruction system, we wanted the classes to be great, and we wanted the core combat system to be the best we've ever created."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Combat, Classes &amp; Destruction Breakdown Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We knew what we knew what we needed to do in the beginning," Ripple Effect creative director Thomas Anderson added. "To take the best parts of Battlefield 3 and 4 and just push those to quality."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 dives back into this modern setting with a global conflict that provides a pleasant variety of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/">map locations</a>. We were able to get hands-on with five different maps across various modes. We fought gritty, close-quarters fights in the streets of New York on the Empire State map, while Liberation Peak served as a large, mountainous landscape with tons of wide-open spaces for snipers. Siege of Cairo is a sprawling desert map for large-scale modes like Conquest, but we also played a smaller slice of the locale for the more condensed Squad Deathmatch mode. These smaller maps are pulled from the larger map designs, but placement of objects and how destruction is used has been altered to fit the smaller play area.</p><p dir="ltr">The Squad Deathmatch mode provides the opportunity to step away from Battlefield's typical large-scale warfare and go for a more hectic pace with in-your-face action moments that feel more in line with an experience you’d get from a Call of Duty multiplayer match. These feature four squads of four fighting on small maps to be the first to rack up a certain number of kills. You still have roles to play in Squad Deathmatch, and with such close-quarters action and more opportunities to die, the medic-style Support class is very useful here.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Battlefield 6's large-scale modes are where the game shines. Our multiplayer session included the familiar modes of Conquest, Domination, and Breakthrough. This is where the destruction feels more impactful, as certain buildings can serve as power positions to hold flags, but you can change the direction of the fight by simply collapsing all the floors with well-aimed rockets or a grenade launcher. I've always found the destruction in older Battlefield games to be extremely satisfying, and it feels even more so in Battlefield 6. Targeting a building often doesn't just take away the frontside or a specific chunk; you can collapse several floors and sometimes an entire building of a structure on top of opponents. And that makes it a significant hazard to watch out for when moving through interior spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">Tanks can now more easily drive through structures as well. Enemies behind a wall? No problem: You can just drive a tank right through concrete walls to take them out, while also forging new pathways for your teammates. Tanks were really fun to drive and use to bully right through enemy defenses. As for air support, I'm the pilot most likely to crash and wipe my whole squad. From what I can tell, flying vehicles seem like a blast to use; helicopters and jets were crashing everywhere in a way only Battlefield does.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these destructive and cinematic moments come at a cost, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-skipping-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6533611/">Battlefield 6 is moving away from last-generation consoles</a>. When discussing the improvements in technology, Christian Grass said, "It's really difficult from a technological and balancing point of view to create the package that is Battlefield. There are so many things that are competing in terms of computation power that we need. The vision of Battlefield 6 wouldn't have been possible on the previous generation."</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the destruction elements, another Battlefield signature is its class system with weapons tied to each role. Being an Engineer once meant you had to use a submachine gun if you wanted to repair tanks, or you'd need to wield a light machine gun if you wanted to play a support role for the match. Now, Battlefield 6 aims to break that mold without losing the feel of the class-based roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165"></a><figcaption>Tanks in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542166,1300-4542167,1300-4542168,1300-4542169,1300-4542170,1300-4542171,1300-4542172,1300-4542173" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The traditional class system was one of the loudest talking points prior to Battlefield 6's reveal. Originally, the developers announced that every weapon would be available regardless of class, but there was backlash from the community, as many players didn't want the game to lean away from the traditional Battlefield class system. Battlefield Studios listened, and now players will have the freedom to choose between having weapons unlocked or choosing a classic weapon-locked system for Battlefield 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who's played a ton of Battlefield games over the years, I was curious which way I'd lean in the great class debate. We spent around seven to eight hours playing the Battlefield 6 closed beta, and I often found myself choosing to go outside the specialized weapons for the Support and Engineering classes. Honestly, call me a Battlefield disloyalist if you want, but I rarely wanted to use a light machine gun when playing Support, and I almost never wanted a submachine gun when playing as an Engineer on the large-scale maps and modes. That's not to say that the submachine guns don't feel great, but I preferred to use them when playing in close-quarters scenarios on the smaller Squad Deathmatch maps.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says the choice for locked or unlocked weapons will be available in the beta and at launch. Additionally, there are no XP penalties for choosing one option or the other. "We're confident in our design," Andersson said, "But if people don't agree or a niche of players don't agree, they can play [weapons locked.]” "They can play however they want," Grass said, jumping in. "We're happy as long as you're having a good time playing Battlefield 6."</p><p dir="ltr">Each class will still have its own role to play, and my time with Battlefield 6 never felt like I wasn't playing a meaningful class type when I did swap my weapons. However, it can be beneficial to stick with a class's specialized weapons, as you get trait bonuses for using that weapon type. For example, the Recon class rewards snipers with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope speed, and improved breath control to stabilize aim for longer. Non-Recon players who use a sniper might feel at a slight disadvantage, but they can still complement that weapon choice with other tools available to their class.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the specialization bonuses, each class comes with its own unique gadgets and a special class-specific Active Ability that can be used and recharged over time. For example, the Recon class features the Active Ability to call in a UAV, and the Engineer Active Ability allows you to repair more efficiently for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement is also improved in Battlefield 6. The game features what Battlefield Studios call a "Kinesthetic Combat System," which is basically a whole mouthful just to say there are new maneuvering actions to help you excel on the battlefield. With this updated system you can now peek and lean around corners, mount weapons against a surface to reduce recoil, hitch a ride on the sides of tanks, and even drag teammates while simultaneously reviving them. These actions are very situational, but the most impactful is the ability to drag and revive downed friendlies while moving them to the safety of cover. I definitely saved more lives during my time with Battlefield 6, and it really makes you feel like a hero while performing these revives .</p><p dir="ltr">These are early impressions that point to a strong start for Battlefield's return to a modern landscape. It's also worth mentioning that this beta build of the game felt extremely polished, and I didn't encounter any lag or performance issues. Out of the several hours played, I only experienced one instance of a bugged optic on my assault rifle, which caused a prismatic color pattern to appear in the scope and block my view.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only got to play a handful of maps and modes, with a total of nine maps confirmed for launch, including the return of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. The popular game mode Rush is also confirmed to return, but we didn't get a chance to play it at the reveal. There is still content yet to be seen, and we also don't yet have a good indication of what the game's post-launch content might look like.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if the game would keep thematically appropriate skins and bundles for Battlefield 6, or if they had plans to add wacky Call of Duty-style bundles, Grass said, "Battlefield 6 is a modern military shooter." The developer also referenced the skins designed for the premium Phantom Edition of Battlefield 6, which are soldiers in black suits that still keep the style and gear of modern military uniforms. Of course, that doesn't mean the future won't include something a bit more outlandish. "We're talking about now and not necessarily the future, but we are a modern military shooter," Grass reiterated.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, my early impressions for Battlefield 6 suggests a strong return to the modern-day setting and a positive step towards balancing the classic experience with updated mechanics and freedom for all playstyles. All the big action moments are there, the destruction is exciting and more impactful than ever, and the gunplay feels solid. So far, it's shaping up to be the more direct successor to the beloved Battlefield 3 and 4 that many fans have been waiting for.</p>

                <p>Adult games--and games with adult themes--have been delisted from digital game sales portals Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> recently, following pressure from companies that process those platforms' payments to remove them. After an extended period of silence on the matter, Mastercard has released a statement and says that its recent actions are based on the "rule of law" and aren't an attempt to enforce censorship.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's worth noting that there has been no evidence that the games removed from Steam and Itch.io included illegal content, and for an even deeper breakdown, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/steam-itch-takedowns-credit-cards-1.7597563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC have detailed timelines</a> on the entire situation so far. Visa also put out a pre-written response to complaints (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" rel="nofollow ">Polygon</a>), adding that it didn't aim to "make moral judgments on legal purchases" and that it was also adhering to the letter of the law.</p><p>The pressure from payment processors was apparently the result of a campaign by the Australian anti-porn lobbying group Collective Shout, which has taken credit for the actions. Collective Shout released an open letter claiming that Steam and indie games storefront <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> hosted games with "rape, incest and child sexual abuse" content.</p><p>It has also released statements claiming to have sent about 1,000 emails and calls to payment processors, urging them to threaten to pull support from those portals unless those games were removed. But the result has been the delisting of any game with vaguely defined adult content. Developers say that games with LGBTQ themes or content have been caught in the purge, and many have criticized the payment processors for arbitrarily enforcing their moral standards--and Collective Shout's--on what adults are allowed to buy and play.</p><p>In the weeks since payment processors have stopped supporting payments for adult content, several sites have been forced to take drastic measures. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam began purging content</a> from its storefront--and it made a vague update to its terms of service--while Itch.io <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-is-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-following-ban-on-adult-games/1100-6533545/">also began to de-index content from the site</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the site began to "re-index" adult and not safe for work content, adding that it is still in ongoing discussions with payment processors. Itch.io has long used Stripe as its payment processor, but the financial site will no longer support the sale of adult content that fits the description of “content designed for sexual gratification" on Itch.io.</p><p>The last couple of weeks have seen massive pushback against payment companies, as game organizations, developers, and artists have rallied together. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">has called for "greater transparency and fairness"</a> in the moderation of adult games, while other groups have urged people to put pressure on the two payment processors and flood them with calls to register their concerns about censorship.</p>

Miele said EA tried to "not get distracted by what was happening around us," but at the same time, the company did purposefully plan to avoid other major releases.</p>

<p>"We always said that with all of this investment and with all the potential of this franchise, we would not have put it in harm's way, and we would not have put it out in the blast radius of something really large," she said. "We were pretty unblinking, and we weren't allowing ourselves to play the, 'What if?' game with the schedules and development. We were like, 'No, we have to get this done,' because the opportunity is so big and the potential is so significant for the company."</p><p>GTA 6 was originally scheduled to release in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed the game to May 2026. After the GTA 6 delay, EA management said the launch window for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">"clearer than before."</a></p><p>As for Black Ops 7, Activision has not announced a release date yet, but a report said the game will launch on November 14, which would give Battlefield 6 about a month's space.</p><p>Timing is important for game releases, and some have theorized that another EA game, Titanfall 2, launching sandwiched between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare back in 2016 negatively impacted that game's sales. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/amrf7h/jason_schreier_on_the_tf2_release_date_mishap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more to the story</a>, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10. An<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515"> open beta</a> kicks off very soon, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is coming later. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the calendar transitions from summer to fall, one thing is on the mind of every sports game fan: the release of a new EA Sports FC. EA Sports FC 26 is set to release in a couple of months, and it's going to introduce a slew of new gameplay mechanics and features, while returning with all of the game modes that fans know and love. We've already seen a solid chunk of what the game is going to offer, but there could still be some surprises from EA over the next two months.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about the next entry into EA's soccer franchise, so we're going to take a deep dive into everything we currently know about EA Sports FC 26. Here's what to expect when the game launches later this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_EA_Sports_FC_26_be_released_">When will EA Sports FC 26 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">EA has confirmed the release date of EA Sports FC 26 is Sept. 26. This is almost one year to the day of when EA Sports FC 25 was released, which came out on Sept. 27, 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you can't wait that long to play EA Sports FC 26, you can gain up to seven days of early access and start playing on Sept. 19--but only if you pre-order a specific edition of the game. The early access period features the full game, and you'll keep all of your progression during this period after EA Sports FC 26 has been released worldwide. So if you wanted to get a head start in Ultimate Team, for example, the seven days of early access is a huge boon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_preorder_EA_Sports_FC_26">How to preorder EA Sports FC 26</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two editions of EA Sports FC 26 you can preorder: the Standard and Ultimate Edition. Preordering either edition will net you some exclusive bonuses that aim to give you a head start across a variety of game modes. However, preordering the Ultimate Edition is how you gain the seven days of early access that begins on Sept. 19.</p><p dir="ltr">You can see the prices and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-preorder-guide/1100-6533269/">preorder bonuses for the Standard and Ultimate Editions of EA Sports FC 26 in GameSpot's preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">You can preorder either one of these editions of EA Sports FC 26 on your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, EA App). Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official EA FC 26 section of EA's website</a> and preorder using your system account through there.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_EA_Sports_FC_26_trailer_here">Watch the EA Sports FC 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want to see some actual gameplay of EA FC 26, then you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">official reveal trailer</a> below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was received generally well by fans, with many calling it the best reveal trailer for the franchise in years. However, there was a consensus that EA needs to focus on Career Mode with the new game.</p><p dir="ltr">EA went a little deeper into the gameplay side of EA Sports FC 26 with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE8YCIQF2M">Gameplay Deep Dive trailer</a>, which you can watch if you want some more detailed explanations of the changes the game is introducing and how they play out in real time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_platforms">EA Sports FC 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for fans across the video game community, EA Sports FC 26 will be available on every major platform when it releases in September. This includes PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2. EA has decided to make the game available on both Switch consoles, an interesting move considering it isn't doing the same for Madden 26, which is only coming to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to play EA Sports 26 FC on PC, you have the choice of playing on either Steam or via the EA App for Windows. Neither platform has an edge over the other, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_gameplay">EA Sports FC 26 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">EA Sports FC 26 will offer the core content that the franchise has become known for over the years. You'll be able to play Player and Manage Career, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Live Events, as well as basic Quick Play matches.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to gameplay, EA is making some stark changes to how you play EA Sports FC 26. For starters, there are now two separate gameplay presets: Competitive and Authentic. These presets determine the difficulty level at which you'll be playing, and each is designed for a specific area of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Competitive preset features increased responsiveness and player control with an added emphasis on smarter passing, more intuitive rebounds, and so on. This preset is designed for online game modes, such as Ultimate Team and Clubs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053" data-ratio="0.55620316402998" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053"></a><figcaption>EA Sports FC 26 is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, the Authentic preset is designed for offline game modes, like Career. You'll find added realism in this preset, making opponents more difficult to play against, and bringing a higher match speed to coincide with how players actually manage the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">Between these two new gameplay presets, you can also take advantage of freshly tuned gameplay fundamentals. EA has taken community feedback and made sweeping changes across a variety of mechanics to make them feel smoother and more responsive. You'll experience better dribbling, more intuitive AI player positioning, and improved animations, among a flurry of other changes. You can read about all of the mechanics EA has changed in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-gameplay-deep-dive#gameplay-fundamentals" rel="nofollow ">dedicated blog post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, EA has also updated goalkeepers in an attempt to make them more fluid and realistic. Goalkeepers have been given new animations and optimized with machine learning to improve their stances and attack readiness. They also have new deflection control mechanics, so you should see balls go where they're supposed to after a goalkeeper makes a nice save.</p>
