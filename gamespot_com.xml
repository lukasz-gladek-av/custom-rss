                <p>It appears <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> has received a stealthy backend update that tweaks the way your player stats are tracked. Now, EA's military shooter will seemingly no longer count the bots you kill in a match, but if you get blasted by a bot, that death will still show up in your stats sheet for now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1990889499979632848" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 18 X post</a> by the community news source Battlefield Bulletin, the update was deployed to make the game's stats accurate and fair. If you visit your profile page now, you may see a significant drop in your kill-death ratio, possibly suggesting that many of the kills in that stat were merely on bots.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Retired competitive pro player Otto "ottr" Boström <a href="https://x.com/ottrTweets/status/1990809560110584184" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">highlighted this change on his X account</a>, posting a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be his Battlefield 6 profile page on November 18. In one image, he had 88,838 kills, with a 92.950 average K/D. In the subsequent image, his kills dropped to 24,227, with his K/D falling to 3.814. Boström believes this will "expose a lot of players out there."</p><p>While bot kills seem to mean nothing to your overall kills now, Battlefield YouTuber DannyonPC <a href="https://x.com/DANNYonPC/status/1990891124697727425" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mentioned in Battlefield Bulletin's replies</a> that bot deaths--that is, you getting murked by a bot--still count toward your overall deaths. Battlefield Bulletin noted this, saying that it should be addressed "eventually" as well.</p><p>Battlefield Studios hasn't commented on the change yet, but its communications department did <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1991168660103180339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take to X on November 19 to post about other adjustments</a> it recently made to the game. This includes increasing the effective hitboxes of defibrillators, bumping the AFK kick timer in Sabotage from 60 seconds to 180 seconds, temporarily disabling bot backfilling in Sabotage, and clarifying Assignment and Challenge descriptions and criteria to make them easier to achieve and obtain.</p><p>All of these fixes appear to be Battlefield Studios' attempts at curbing bot farming. Since its October 10 launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">rampant use of bots as XP cattle</a>. An October 21 update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-bot-xp-farms-are-no-more/1100-6535606/" data-ref-id="1100-6535606">dropped a grenade on these farms</a>, with a hotfix the following day <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-battlefield-6-update-aims-to-shoot-down-bot-filled-matches/1100-6535629/" data-ref-id="1100-6535629">reducing bots from filling matches</a>. Despite the gates limiting them, lead producer David Sirland explained on November 5 that bots play a crucial role: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/without-battlefield-6-bots-youd-be-waiting-a-lot-longer-producer-says/1100-6535956/" data-ref-id="1100-6535956">They help get games going</a>. And with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">a new Casual Breakthrough mode</a> that introduces a more relaxed way to play Battlefield 6, it's safe to assume they aren't going anywhere. They're just becoming a bit redundant.</p><p>Outside of this hush-hush change, Battlefield Studios did release a new patch for the game across consoles and PC on November 18. Dubbed Update 1.1.2.0, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-patch-notes-include-a-major-change-for-aim-assist/1100-6536292/" data-ref-id="1100-6536292">the patch substantially alters aim-assist</a>, making it "feel smoother and more predictable."</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> return this December, but how were the nominees selected and who determines the games that actually win? And does the public have any say? All of these are questions you might be wondering ahead of the event next week, and here's what we know about the key details.</p><h2><strong>What games are eligible?</strong></h2><p>To be <a href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eligible</a> for The Game Awards this year, games must be "available for public consumption" on or before Friday, November 21. Any game releases after then will be eligible for next year's show. This also means that games released on or after November 22, 2024 are eligible for this year's event.</p><p>Live-service games that released in a previous year are eligible for all categories, provided the voting jury determines that "their inclusion is merited due to new content, improvements, or service updates." There is also a dedicated category, Best Ongoing Game, which recognizes such titles.</p><h2><strong>How are nominees selected?</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards website states that an international jury of more than 100 media and influencer sources--including GameSpot--form a coalition that votes to decide on the nominees.</p><p>"Each voting outlet completes a confidential, unranked ballot based on the collective and diverse opinion of its entire editorial staff, listing out its top five choices in each category," reads a line from the website.</p><p>Ballots are counted and the five games that appear the most on ballots get selected as the nominees. Any category that comes up tied gets pushed to six (or more) nominations. This year, there were six nominees for multiple categories, including Game of the Year, Best Performance, Best Independent Game, and Best Family Game.</p><p>For the eSports, accessibility, and Best Adaptation categories, a "specialized" jury comes together to select those categories.</p><h2>How are winners selected?</h2><p>The Game Awards are ultimately decided upon by the same voting jury, but public fan voting factors in as well, which is why you may have seen developers call upon their fandoms to vote for their game. The voting jury controls 90% of the vote, with public fan voting making up the other 10%.</p><p>People can vote on The Game Awards website, or in China, people can make their selections on Bilibili. Voting closes on Wednesday, December 10 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET.</p><p>Some have called on The Game Awards to adopt a 100% pubic fan vote stance where the fans have all the say, but the organizers say this would create "several challenges."</p><p>"First, given that some games are exclusive to one platform, a public vote puts single-platform games at an inherent disadvantage over multi-platform titles. In addition, it is important that winners cannot be socially engineered in any way. We find that a blended vote is the most credible and authentic way to select winners," the team said.</p><h2><strong>No fees</strong></h2><p>All games are "automatically eligible" for The Game Awards, with no submission process at all, and this means there is no fee for a publisher or developer to put their game forth for consideration. "The Game Awards strongly believes that no game developer or publisher should have to pay to have a game considered for nomination," the team said. Not every awards show works this way, as developers/publishers <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/program/gamescom-award" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay to have their games considered at the Gamescom Awards</a>, starting at €440 ($508 USD).</p><h2><strong>Is Geoff Keighley involved?</strong></h2><p>Geoff Keighley is the creator and host of The Game Awards, but he is not a member of the voting jury. He has been very public about his close friendship with Death Stranding director Hideo Kojima, which has raised some eyebrows over the years at The Game Awards.</p><h2><strong>Other bias concerns</strong></h2><p>The Game Awards is funded, in part, by sponsors--some of whom have games in the running for awards. The organizers claim "there is no connection" between sponsorship and nominations/awards. The voting jury is "wholly unaware of who is sponsoring or participating in other elements of the program," according to The Game Awards. The group also claims that the nominees and winners are not shared with the developers beforehand, with teams finding out "at the same time as the public."</p><p>"The Game Awards does not disclose winners in advance of the live ceremony. There are no exceptions to this rule," the group said.</p><hr><p>The Game Awards will be held on December 11, and streamed live around the world. In addition to naming all the award winners, the event promises game announcements, trailers, and other reveals.</p>

The mode does exactly what you'd expect: allows you to replay the entirety of Atsu's revenge tale with all of the gear and skills you've already unlocked, giving you an edge--or a bullet--on the battlefield, which means you don't have to unlock the two different guns again. You'll start Atsu's journey already strapped.</p><p>You can also replay challenges with stat tracking to set scores for certain duels, experience harder difficulty options in the settings menu, and purchase new gear (like charms, dyes, and cosmetics) from a new merchant.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY8MXfksWuw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vY8MXfksWuw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sucker Punch Productions' senior communications manager Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/19/new-game-plus-comes-to-ghost-of-yotei-november-24/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed more details about the free update</a> on the PlayStation Blog. He explained that patch 1.100.000 will also feature new accessibility options (such as directional button remapping), an enhanced photo mode, two new Trophies, and an extra upgrade tier for your existing armor and weapons.</p><p>In other Ghost of Yotei news, we recently learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-scaling-back-a-key-game-feature-was-difficult-but-the-right-call-dev-says/1100-6536303/" data-ref-id="1100-6536303">the game's cool time-bending mechanic</a>--which allows Atsu to return to her past to relive key story beats--was scaled back. The original plan was to let you do this whenever you wanted, but with it demanding extra work, creative director Jason Connell said the "right choice" was to narrow its scope, which honed its efficacy.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei has been a success for Sucker Punch Productions and Sony. The action-adventure game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/" data-ref-id="1100-6536128">sold 3.3 million copies since its October 2 launch</a> on PS5 and has been generally well-received by critics and fans alike. We awarded it a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, calling it a sequel that truly "builds and improves upon its predecessor."</p>
