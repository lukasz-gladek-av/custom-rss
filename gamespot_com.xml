It'll be in role queue format, with 2-2-2 rules, meaning that teams need to be split into an equal number of tanks, damage, and support characters. The experiment will last until January 6.</p><p>There are also plenty of new holiday-themed skins to earn for characters. Playing three, six, and nine games will reward you with the Merry Marionette Echo Legendary, Cassidy's legendary, and Widowmaker's legendary skins, respectively.</p><p>Some games received holiday and winter-themed updates recently--this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-gets-a-cheerful-holiday-update-this-week-with-new-minigame/1100-6528497/" data-ref-id="1100-6528497">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-new-free-winter-wonder-level-on-thursday/1100-6528374/" data-ref-id="1100-6528374">Astro Bot</a> have gotten their own.</p>
