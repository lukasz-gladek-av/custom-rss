                <p>An official set of pre-painted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldurs Gate 3</a> minis has been doing the rounds on the internet after fans received their sets to find their favorite companions unrecognizable at best, and hideous at worst. They are so bad, in fact, that refunds are being offered. </p><p>The D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 box set by WizKids featured characters Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, and Lae'zel, along with fan-favorite undead companion Withers. While the paint job featured in WizKids' <a href="https://x.com/wizkidsgames/status/1907456406778737131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promotional imagery</a> looked pretty solid, the minis received by fans were anything but. Check out a few examples posted by Larian artist Elodie Ceselli on X:</p><p>Other photos posted by fans in the replies shows that, while the jank levels seem to vary piece by piece, the quality is pretty abysmal across the board. Pre-painted minis aren't generally known for being works of art, however in this case, WizKids issued a formal apology and is offering full refunds to any customer who isn't happy with the quality, which we assume means all of them. </p><p>"Please accept our sincerest apologies for the frustration and disappointment these quality issues caused our customers," WizKids says on its <a href="https://wizkids.com/recent-announcements-2/baldurs-gate-3-character-boxed-set-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. "We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner."</p><p>The product listing for the BG3 minis has been pulled down for now, as WizKids seeks to "ensure these issues do not recur in future products and reprints." The company has also offered unhappy fans the option to request a replacement instead of a refund, and has promised to make sure that the replacement product "meets the standards expected."</p>

Players reportedly had issues with the game crashing or failing to load entirely, and also experienced issues with multiplayer gameplay.</p><p>Players also had complaints about the content introduced in Version 1.5, claiming that the developer was introducing more-aggressive monetization practices, and even retconning parts of Nikki's story in order to sell new outfits. The controversial update released on the same day Infinity Nikki launched on Steam, meaning the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews</a> are currently mostly negative, with the reviews now a laundry list of players' frustrations with the direction of the game.</p><p>Infinity Nikki developer Infold Games apologized for the issues in an <a href="https://x.com/InfinityNikkiEN/status/1923937697745469653" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">extensive X post</a>, which outlines the issues, the team's plan to fix them, and the compensation players will be able to receive.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1312814879" data-promo-id="0"

and unsatisfactory content," the post reads. "We fully acknowledge that this is our responsibility, and addressing these shortcomings remains a top priority for our team moving forward."</p><p>Infold says it will be extending the current version, effectively delaying the release of Version 1.6 to give the developers more time to address these issues. Bubble Season and the various events associated with Version 1.5 will now be extended until June 12.</p><p>The studio also offered an explanation for changes to the game's narrative, saying, "The Threads of Reunion storyline's absence in this version was never intended as a removal from Infinity Nikki's narrative--its associated outfit remain on our development roadmap." The post says that these story elements are still planned for a future update.</p><p>It's a relatively common practice to offer in-game currency as compensation for issues in the world of gacha games. Players will be able to redeem 120 Diamonds and one Energy Crystal every day from June 5-12, for a total of 960 Diamonds and eight Energy Crystals. Players will also receive 360 Starlit Crystals as compensation for the Starlit Pursuit feature being pushed back until Version 1.6.</p>

Apple has since blocked the submission, and Epic is appealing to the court to uphold its injunction against Apple.</p><p>After Apple left the Fortnite submission unaddressed for over a week, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-wont-be-coming-to-ios-soon-as-apple-blocks-epics-app-store-submission/1100-6531588/" data-ref-id="1100-6531588">finally responded to Epic</a> to block Fortnite's return in the US. Apple has said that it won't take action on the Fortnite submission "until after the Ninth Circuit rules on our pending request for a partial stay of the new injunction," a move Epic believes is in violation of the injunction itself. In response, Epic has filed a second Motion to Enforce Injunction with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">California district court in question</a>.</p><p>Epic Games managed to get Fortnite back on iPhones <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-back-on-iphone-after-4-years-depending-on-where-you-live/1100-6525849/" data-ref-id="1100-6525849">in Europe last year</a>, thanks to the European Union's Digital Markets Act, but the game is currently offline again in the EU due to the ongoing drama with the US App Store.</p><p>In a letter sent by Apple, the company suggests Epic resubmit Fortnite only for EU territories "to prevent our discussions surrounding the US storefront of the App Store from impacting Fortnite in other geographies." The letter further recommends submitting Fortnite to the US App Store "separately through an entity other than Epic Sweden," but Epic's <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1923558197802971459" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response</a> suggests this recommendation is in violation of Apple's own guidelines.</p><p>"That's not the standard Apple holds other developers to and it's blocking us from releasing our update in the EU and US," Epic says. "Apple is again retaliating against Epic for challenging the legality of their anticompetitive behavior and we will fight on."</p><p>The next step in this legal battle is now with the courts, with Apple having filed a request for partial stay with the Ninth Circuit Court, and Epic filing a Motion to Enforce Injunction with the US District Court for the Northern District of California. The district court judge who filed the latest injunction against Apple has also referred the case to a US criminal attorney for possible contempt charges.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Fortnite's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-start-date-star-wars-battle-pass-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6530938/" data-ref-id="1100-6530938">Star Wars-themed Galactic Battle event</a> reintroduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">Darth Vader</a> to the game with a twist. Thanks to an AI-generated voice based on the late <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-and-lion-king-actor-james-earl-jones-dies-at-93/1100-6526373/" data-ref-id="1100-6526373">James Earl Jones</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">players can speak to Darth Vader</a> in real time and get the Dark Lord of the Sith to respond <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">within certain limitations</a>. Now SAG-AFTRA--the actors union which is currently engaged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-and-publishers-clash-over-best-and-last-offer-to-end-the-strike/1100-6531336/" data-ref-id="1100-6531336">in a protracted voiceover performers strike</a> against video game publishers, largely over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">the use of AI voices</a>--has filed an unfair-labor-practice complaint against Epic Games for Fortnite's use of Darth Vader's AI voice.</p><p>Two years before Jones passed away in 2024, he retired as the voice of Darth Vader and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-earl-jones-steps-back-as-darth-vaders-voice-as-ai-takes-over-the-role/1100-6507813/" data-ref-id="1100-6507813">signed a deal that allows an AI program to recreate his iconic voice</a> in perpetuity. SAG-AFTRA's filing contends that the deal with Jones' estate doesn't extend to other voice actors who have portrayed Darth Vader in its filing with the National Labor Relations Board.</p><p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles," noted a SAG-AFTRA spokesperson via <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/sag-aftra-fortnites-ai-darth-vader-unfair-labor-complaint-1236405218/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader’s iconic rhythm and tone in video games."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA contends that Fortnite's parent companies, Llama Productions and Epic Games, committed the unfair labor act by failing to disclose its intent to replace a human performer with AI and for not coming to an agreement with the union ahead of time.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the filing will have any effect on Vader's presence in the game. In the meantime, fans have posted numerous videos on social media that encourage the AI Vader to say off-the-wall and sometimes-offensive things. </p><p>Fortnite's Star Wars Galactic Battle event will continue until June 7.</p>
