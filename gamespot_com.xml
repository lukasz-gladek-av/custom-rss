                <p>Ubisoft has announced Vantage Studios, which is a "creative house" at the company that will spearhead the development of the Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises.</p><p>This is the name of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">new subsidiary that Ubisoft and Tencent announced earlier this year</a>. It's being led by Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, along with Christophe Derennes. Charlie Guillemot is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-new-spun-off-division-is-being-led-by-yves-guillemots-son-and-he-loves-genai/1100-6533205/" data-ref-id="1100-6533205">aware of the nepotism concerns and said he just wants to get to work.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161" data-ratio="0.55928646379853" data-width="953" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578161"></a><figcaption>The franchises that Vantage Studios is focusing on.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578161-screenshot2025-10-01at9.26.13%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>"Vantage Studios will take on development and expansion of these brands, building on the foundation of Ubisoft's experience and expertise, sharing services and technical resources, all while giving developers more hands-on control over the games they are building," Ubisoft said.</p><p>The company added that Vantage Studios is Ubisoft's "first step" in the company's ongoing transformation efforts. There are also plans currently underway to make "additional creative houses" and a push to "group its brands and franchises under the banner of a shared DNA and development expertise."</p><h2><strong>So, what does Vantage Studios do?</strong></h2><p>Vantage Studios, along with any future "creative houses" that may come, have the directive of being the teams to "facilitate stronger and deeper connections between developers and players."</p><p>"This streamlined approach allows for both a higher level of autonomy for developers and a shorter pathway between gathering and implementing player feedback, while still offering the benefit of Ubisoft's expertise, services, tools, and tech," the developer added.</p><p>Vantage Studios is comprised of teams working on the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises for its teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia.</p><p>Finally, Ubisoft said people should "keep your eyes peeled for future announcements."</p><h2><strong>How Ubisoft got here</strong></h2><p>Ubisoft was facing financial hardships and undertook cost-cutting efforts that included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a> The company was accused by some of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">"horribly managed,"</a> and reports emerged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">EA (now itself being acquired)</a> and Microsoft were among those said to be interested in acquiring some or all of Ubisoft prior to Tencent coming in with its offer.</p><p>In March 2025, Ubisoft announced a new "dedicated subsidiary" that is focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six, with Tencent providing more than $1 billion to acquire a stake. Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prototype-2009/">Prototype</a> fans believe that they've found new clues suggesting a remaster is on the way, as several updates to the game were recently spotted online.</p><p>As seen on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/10150/history/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a> and through recent data-mining (via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prototype subreddit</a>), the game's credits have been updated to include Iron Galaxy and Ubisoft Connect. <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/WV75q76C/" rel="nofollow ">The new credits</a> highlight hundreds of additions and there are references to "downloadable content" and "Ubisoft Connect Version" teams.</p><p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-will-sell-activision-cloud-rights-to-ubisoft-in-latest-attempt-to-secure-its-acquisition/1100-6517056/" data-ref-id="1100-6517056">Microsoft sold Activision's cloud-gaming rights to Ubisoft</a> after it acquired Activision Blizzard. "For Prototype 1, they have added some test maps and quite a few new names in the credits. There might be some hope for a remaster after all," Redditor StanleyMitchel added.</p><p>Prototype was first released in 2009, and the game saw you take on the role of Alex Mercer, an amnesiac bioweapon seeking to uncover the secrets of his past. The only catch? New York City was under heavy quarantine since the Blacklight virus outbreak, leaving him caught in the middle of a war between the infected populace and a secret US army division tasked with containing the virus by any means necessary.</p><p>A sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prototype-2/">Prototype 2</a>, was released in 2012 and it featured a new protagonist, former US soldier James Heller. The franchise has been dormant since it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prototype-1-and-2-xbox-oneps4-now-available-indivi/1100-6429726/">ported to PS4 and Xbox One in 2015</a>.</p>

                <p>A new streak for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> called Gravemaker gives players the ability to one-shot kill enemies through walls, and it looks extremely powerful and annoying to be on the receiving end of.</p><p>Gravemaker is a one-shot sniper rifle. It was originally announced in August, but it wasn't until Call of Duty: Next this week that we actually got to see how it works in a real match. Footage from Call of Duty League professional player SimpXO shows how devastating the streak can be. Gravemaker shows an enemy's silhouette through walls when aiming down sights, and as you can see in the video, it's very deadly.</p><p>Beyond its default setup, it has <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">two overclock settings</a> that juice it up further. Overlock 1 is a larger magazine for more ammo and Overlock 2 allows it to have reduced charge time before firing.</p><p>The developers are said to be <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1957910013030354954" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">watching feedback closely</a> to possibly make changes to Gravemaker if it's deemed to be too powerful or negatively affects the experience overall. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 beta begins on October 2</a>--and Gravemaker is among the included streaks--so Activision will soon have lots more data to look at.</p><p>People are also pointed out that Gravemaker appears to be just the <a href="https://perfectdark.fandom.com/wiki/FarSight_XR-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest evolution of the FarSight gun from Perfect Dark</a> that also allowed players to shoot through walls and aggravate their enemies.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta begins October 2 and runs through October 8, during which people can try out a selection of the game's modes and maps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/" data-ref-id="1100-6534980">along with Zombies. </a>The full game, meanwhile, launches on November 14 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> got off to a hot start earlier in 2025 with 10 million copies sold in its first month before suffering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">a dramatic decline in sales</a> as well as lingering performance issues on PC. Now, Capcom is warning players that the impending conclusion of support for Windows 10 means that three of the most recent Monster Hunter games will no longer be guaranteed to work on that operating system.</p><p>Capcom shared a message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that reminded players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-ditches-32-bit-support-as-windows-10-nears-its-end/1100-6534864/" data-ref-id="1100-6534864">Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10</a> on October 14. Consequently, the publisher states, "we will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-world/" data-ref-id="5000-465583">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and Monster Hunter Wilds will run on Windows 10 systems."</p><p>The publisher went on to say that the games will still be playable on that operating system after that date. But any future game updates for those titles may render them incompatible with Windows 10 machines.</p><p>A Capcom executive recently blamed Monster Hunter Wilds' drop in sales on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">the high price of PS5 </a>consoles. Capcom acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-monster-hunter-wilds-update-finally-addresses-poor-pc-performance/1100-6532814/" data-ref-id="1100-6532814">the game's problems on PC</a> in June, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sees-huge-jump-in-pc-players-after-free-title-update-2/1100-6532910/" data-ref-id="1100-6532910">Wilds saw a surge in players</a> after a subsequent update. Capcom dropped another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> last month, but the game's larger PC issues won't be directly addressed until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Capcom debuted a crossover collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-new-update-adds-final-fantasy-14-jobs-and-more/1100-6535012/" data-ref-id="1100-6535012">Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14</a>, which was released earlier this week. The publisher also teased the return of the elder dragon Gogmazios in December's Free Title Update 4.</p>

                <p>A new firmware update--Version: 25.06-12.02.00--for the PlayStation 5 console has gone live, and unsurprisingly, it doesn't do much. What this new update does is improve the security on your device, but don't expect to see any new major features added to your PS5 once it has been installed.</p><p>"We've made some security fixes to the system software," reads the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-za/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very succinct update notes</a>.

Beyond that, 2025 has been a year of incremental improvements and tweaks to the PS5 user experience.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the first system's launch in the US and Europe, and to celebrate, Sony has unveiled new collectibles.
