                <p>Ubisoft has yet to share its plans for future Assassin's Creed games beyond <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, but that title's dual-protagonist setup with Yasuke and Naoe may not be the last time players get to have multiple characters to choose from.</p><p>"I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future--if we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting," said Assassin's Creed Shadows associate director Simon Lemay-Comtois while speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Yasuke and Noae weren't the first dual protagonists in an Assassin's Creed game. Twins Jacob and Evie were featured in Assassin's Creed Syndicate. Shadows had more pronounced differences between its two heroes than Syndicate did. Yasuke was built for physical confrontations while Naoe was refined for stealth. Lemay-Comtois acknowledged those differences and some of the backlash the team faced because of Yasuke's inclusion.</p><p>"Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It's not just a, 'Well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke,'" said Lemay-Comtois. "Some people just don't like one character over the other, and they don't like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it's more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too."</p><p>For future titles, Lemay-Comtois called out parkour as something will be given a greater focus. He acknowledged that parkour hasn't been a priority in past Assassin's Creed games before adding, "We're trying to rectify that in post launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, 'parkour matters.' Let's really push parkour forward."</p><p>Lemay-Comtois recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/" data-ref-id="1100-6536570">Shadows will not get a second DLC expansion</a> like most of its predecessors. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also stated that Shadows was pushed back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ac-shadows-delay-was-result-of-yasuke-backlash-ubisoft-says/1100-6536000/" data-ref-id="1100-6536000">because of the backlash against the game</a>. The company has acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exceeded-expectations-for-ubisoft-mirage-hits-10-million-players/1100-6536470/" data-ref-id="1100-6536470">Shadows and the back catalog of Assassin's Creed over-performed</a> in the last fiscal quarter.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows players are currently able to access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-free-limited-time-attack-on-titan-quest/1100-6536489/" data-ref-id="1100-6536489">a free Attack on Titan-inspired mission</a>, but only through December 22.</p>

                <p>The PlayStation 5 dominated Black Friday sales in the US, according to new data shared by Circana, which tracks gaming sales in the US.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7du6uaaec2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Sony's console made up 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, outpacing the Switch 2 (24%) and Nex Playground (14%). He didn't share any data about how Xbox performed.</p><p>"So, yeah, Black Friday week is extremely promotional for video games. Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none). BF Week performance can correlate closely to what's being promoted and by how much," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjdbqz7s2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piscatella said</a>.</p><p>He <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m7gjfbjdb22b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added</a>: "On the hardware side, PS5 saw the most extensive discounting. So, it got a big sales lift. Wouldn't take much more away from the week than that, tbh."</p><p>Indeed, the PS5 was discounted substantially for Black Friday, with Sony selling the consoles for about $100 off. Retailers offered discounts on Xbox consoles and the Nex Playground as well. For anyone unaware, the Nex Playground is an AI-powered console similar to Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. The Nex Playground <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/" data-ref-id="1100-6536701">outsold every PS5 and Xbox model</a> the previous week in the US.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegamebusiness.com/post/3m7cl2uibp227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In the UK</a>, the PS5 dominated as well, making up 62% of all console sales. By comparison, Switch 2 made up 23% of sales, with Xbox following with 10%. The PS5 Pro in particular was a big hit in the UK for Black Friday, recording its best week for sales since launch in November 2024.</p>

                <p>Microsoft originally rejected a pitch to bring Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 to PlayStation consoles, but the company eventually agreed, and this led to a "whole avalanche" of Xbox games on PlayStation. That's according to Head of Microsoft Flight Simulator Jorg Neumann.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-ps5-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XDA-Developers</a> that it was his own idea to bring Flight Simulator to PlayStation consoles, culminating with the launch of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 today, December 8, on PS4 and PS5.</p><p>The 2020 Flight Simulator game eventually grew to become 300 GB in size, and there was so much content planned that Neumann said the game could grow to become 1 TB. So instead of doing that, the team made a new game, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and the game now only has 8 GB of space for a requirement, with everything else sent to the cloud. This way of packaging the game allowed the game to come to other platforms, Neumann said.</p><p>"So I proposed, probably two and a half years ago, to go to PlayStation," he said. "It was probably a little bit before its time because I was told no. Then, somebody from Sony who grew up with flight simulation thought it would be a great addition to the Sony portfolio. They reached out proactively to our president, who then came back to me and said, 'Hey, remember when we talked about the PlayStation thing a year ago? Sony is also interested.'"</p><p>It was this very conversation that Neumann believes "kicked off a whole avalanche of Xbox titles coming to PlayStation," even if Flight Simulator wouldn't end up being the first.</p><p>Microsoft started bringing more of its games to PlayStation (and Switch in some cases) earlier in 2025, including Grounded, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft also brought Doom: The Dark Ages to PS5 this year, along with The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p>Looking to 2026, Microsoft will release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> on PS5, representing the Halo franchise's debut on a rival console platform. It will launch day-and-date with the Xbox edition of the game next year.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft has said it decided to bring Xbox games to PlayStation and Switch because it wanted to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/02/21/new-platforms-new-players-xbox-games-switch-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meet players where they are</a>. The PS5 has sold considerably more units than the Xbox Series X|S, so bringing Xbox games to that platform is a boon for Microsoft's business.</p><p>Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has reportedly mandated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Xbox make more money</a>, which may help explain the push for more multiplatform releases, along with the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">Game Pass price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox console price increases</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, studio closures</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-doom-devs-confirm-romero-games-is-not-closed-despite-game-cancelation/1100-6533006/" data-ref-id="1100-6533006">publishing deal cancellations of late</a>.</p>
