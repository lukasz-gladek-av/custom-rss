Titled Visions of Eternity, it will have players setting sail for a mythical island, one where they'll be able to unlock a new beachside Homestead and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In Visions of Eternity, players will journey into the unknown to the fabled island of Castora, where they'll need to put a stop to a group of evildoers looking to use the island for their own nefarious ends.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4cdnrLCs-M" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A4cdnrLCs-M" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">On launch day, Visions of Eternity will add a swath of new features to the 13-year-old MMORPG, including two new maps to explore, new legendary weapons, updates to the Skimmer mount, new Homestead housing system features, and additional elite specializations for each profession to allow for more build possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">A fantasy beach house is one great reason to travel to Castora. Players will turn an island shipwreck into their island getaway, and new Homestead features will make it so players can quickly and easily share their housing creations so that they can instantly be recreated by others (as long as they have the requisite decorations).</p><p dir="ltr">This is the second Homestead for Guild Wars 2, after the game's previous expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-2-is-getting-player-housing-in-new-janthir-wilds-expansion/1100-6523933/" data-ref-id="1100-6523933">Janthir Wilds</a>, introduced the feature. While players can only have one active Homestead at a time, they will be able to use the layouts feature to instantly restore their home customizations when swapping between homes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4531941-guildwars2visionsofeternityhomestead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531941" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4531941-guildwars2visionsofeternityhomestead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531941"></a><figcaption>A look at Visions of Eternity's new beachside Homestead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4531941-guildwars2visionsofeternityhomestead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Janthir Wilds, Visions of Eternity will receive three major updates for free throughout 2026. These updates will add additional story content, maps, legendary weapons, and endgame content to the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Guild Wars 2: Visions of Eternity is available for <a href="https://buy.guildwars2.com/en-us/visions-of-eternity" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder</a> now, with a number of different editions to choose from. Pre-purchasing the $25 standard edition comes with various preorder bonus items like a Sea Captain Hat headpiece, the Eternal Alchemist titled, a shared inventory slot, and a level-80 character boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The $50 deluxe edition of Visions of Eternity includes the Castoran Tentacled Skimmer skin, an additional character slot, a set of Fairy's Call Gathering tools, and an identity repair kit. The $75 ultimate edition of the expansion includes all previous bonus items as well as 4,000 Gems, Guild Wars 2's premium currency used for purchases in its in-game store.</p><p dir="ltr">If Guild Wars 2 isn't your speed, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/guild-wars-is-celebrating-20-years-with-a-new-and-deeply-discounted-complete-edition/1100-6530852/" data-ref-id="1100-6530852">Guild Wars recently celebrated 20 years</a> with a new complete edition that bundles together all three of the subscription-free MMO's campaigns and its Eye of the North expansion.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Snapshot Games' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2347080/Frosthaven/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Frosthaven</a> (which I'll henceforth refer to as Frosthaven Digital) is a video game version of the tabletop game of the same name. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frosthaven/" data-ref-id="5000-542087">Frosthaven</a>'s predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gloomhaven/" data-ref-id="5000-485475">Gloomhaven</a>, got a similar digital version in 2021 (which was helmed by Flaming Fowl Studios). Unlike games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which adapt mechanics and themes from their tabletop inspirations (Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Cyberpunk RED, respectively) to create a unique gameplay experience, Frosthaven Digital is just Frosthaven--it's the board game minus the need to meet up with friends physically. For someone like me, who primarily hangs out with people virtually, Frosthaven Digital is a boon. I've wanted to introduce the board game to friends for a while, and this lets me without us all having to meet up in person to do it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital was well-received when it came out, and the fanbase has been eager to see Frosthaven make the jump to digital as well. Among the excitement, however, has been a recurring concern: Will Frosthaven Digital have an undo feature? In person, when you make a mistake while playing a tabletop game, the only thing stopping you from fixing it is you and your friends. That's not necessarily the case for a video game if there's no option to do so. In Gloomhaven Digital, it was possible to restart an entire encounter if you wanted, but there was no way to simply start your turn over or undo your last action. It was frustratingly awful, with misclicks resulting in a wasted turn. Fans have wondered if Frosthaven Digital will follow suit, and thankfully, it's not.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Undo] was the most requested feature [for] Gloomhaven," Frosthaven game director Hristo Petkov told me. "It [didn't] exist in Gloomhaven Digital, and according to our engineers, it was impossible [for Frosthaven Digital]. But yeah, we did it."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532513"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital replicates the look and feel of the original board game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532513-ss_3c1d41b42d92ba93a0b33ca5029eabdac3be9f8c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Frosthaven is a dark fantasy RPG that sees you and your fellow players become adventurers who find themselves in the snow-laden town of Frosthaven. Each character class has its own goals and abilities (portrayed as cards). In combat, each player plays two cards to determine what their character does on a turn, and moves through a scenario along a hexagonal grid. During missions, you can also find loot that you can bring back to town to build new structures or improve existing infrastructure, unlocking additional storylines and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Between scenarios, your team can rest to regain spent cards, but over time, you regain less and less. Once every card in your deck is gone for good, your character retires and becomes just another non-player character in town. You pick a new character class, grab their ability cards, and keep going, slowly building the legends of these different adventurers that came to Frosthaven. Your character can also just die, too, but in Frosthaven, most characters retire before succumbing to death.</p><p dir="ltr">Each session of the game takes about two to four hours, and an entire story campaign (if played once every week) will likely take you and your friends a few years to finish. It is a <em>commitment </em>to play this board game, one that should be easier to keep over a virtual call with no physical set-up, if Gloomhaven Digital is any indication. It's not a perfect replacement, though. In going digital, Gloomhaven Digital created new issues to overcome, like the aforementioned inability to undo a simple mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532512"></a><figcaption>You'll return to town often to meet with other characters and build new infrastructure.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532512-ss_95b698ec578ed27844ad3e7a62a913bea1db89fd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Normally, it shouldn't be [too hard] to do something like [an undo mechanic], but we used the code base of Gloomhaven as a starting point," Petkov said. "And [Flaming Fowl Studios'] code base wasn't really suited at all for this. So it basically was rewriting the whole thing. And one of our programmers found a way around it, but it wasn't easy. It took months upon months of work."</p><p dir="ltr">This undo feature is still in development and experimental, so Snapshot Games is looking to the upcoming early access release to see if what it has implemented fits what the fanbase has been asking for. The feature Petkov describes, however, sounds perfect, so I foresee it sticking around in the full version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can enable it in the options [in early access], because there might still be some bugs related to it," Petkov said of the undo feature. "It is pretty well tested--probably no problems with it--but we didn't want to put it in as the default for the beginning of early access. But this is quite amazing--it's not just an undo [for your last turn]. Let's say you are on turn five and in the middle of the round--you can actually undo every action to the beginning of battle. You can undo every single action [at any time]. It is pretty amazing. It works wonders. It was one of the biggest things we needed to do when we started."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532514"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532514-ss_749b16a33263ed2e04a2c4fd7f91067ea83b6303.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like Gloomhaven Digital, Frosthaven Digital seems like it will be a fairly authentic reimagining of the original board game. However, Snapshot Games is going a few steps further with its adaptation, implementing features that don't exist in the original board game but that make for a better video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of the changes that are made are cases where it's quite awkward or difficult to adapt the board game," CEO Julian Gollop told me. "Usually, this is [our] approach and [Frosthaven creator] Isaac [Childres] is generally quite accommodating to this, because he realizes we have to make some adaptations."</p><p dir="ltr">"We have a new tutorial that is three missions, and then we have a four-mission campaign that is the 'Road to Frosthaven,' that is basically created in cooperation with our designers and Isaac," Petkov added. "And the goal for this new campaign is actually to get people who know the board game [or have] played Gloomhaven a little bit [up to speed] on the new things for Frosthaven. They're completely new scenarios to the game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532515"></a><figcaption>Frosthaven Digital will have a brand-new opening that acts as a prologue to the situations found in Frosthaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4532515-ss_bec86b997dc52f6e29ffc6011679e67481d085c3.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Frosthaven Digital will also have difficulty modes, allowing players to curate how challenging the experience is to play. "Frosthaven is pretty hard," Petkov said. "So we created a new difficulty that is basically breaking the rules of the board game. ...It allows you, when you rest--no matter if it's a short or long rest--to not lose cards. It makes it much easier. ...And you have double health--that also helps. From our observations, people who try this difficulty, they don't know about the game. They try the difficulty and they play at least four or five scenarios like this, and then when they feel more comfortable with the game, they can switch the difficulty and go to normal difficulty."</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I'm most looking forward to the artwork and character designs for long-established characters. During my conversation with Petkov and Gollop, they mentioned that though all of Frosthaven's major characters are well-known within the community, there are minor characters that have never been given unique tokens or cards or appeared in artwork for the game. These everyday citizens are being realized for the first time because they now exist in a video game, and not just in players' imaginations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEH2soLIYfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QEH2soLIYfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of the main characters, we have illustrations for them. Some of the main bosses, we have illustrations for them," Petkov said. "But there are quite a lot of characters and environments from the board game that are just described. They're not in the board game, because in the board game, you use placeholder tokens for them--you use a guard token for the blacksmith. All of these are actually created [in Frosthaven Digital], reimagined with new 3D models."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it had a small Steam Next Fest demo, we'll get our first good look at Frosthaven Digital when it launches in early access on Steam and the Epic Games Store on July 31. The early access build starts with eight playable character classes (two of which you have to unlock), and about 40-50 hours of missions to play through. The full game will feature 17 playable character classes and will be a lot longer. "Frosthaven Digital has about 50% more content than Gloomhaven, and about double the complexity," Petkov said. "So it [will be] easily over 200 hours."</p><p dir="ltr">Gloomhaven Digital eventually made its way to Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch a few years after launching on PC. No such plans have been announced for Frosthaven Digital, but the possibility remains.</p>

                <p>Oblivion Remastered's latest update fixes an issue Elder Scrolls lore fans have been wondering about since the remaster's release, though the change isn't listed in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Oblivion ahead</strong>. Those who have previously played the original Oblivion's Dark Brotherhood storyline will likely remember the intimidating door to the Dark Brotherhood's Cheydinhal sanctuary, which sports a relief depicting a woman (the Night Mother) raising a knife against her children. The Night Mother had five children she conceived with the god-like entity Sithis, which is backed up by the fact that inside the Night Mother's tomb in-game, there are skeletal remains of one adult and five children.</p><p dir="ltr">That, however, isn't what the Dark Brotherhood door in Oblivion Remastered looks like. Not only is it lacking the moody red lighting of the original, but it is actually lore-inaccurate as well. In the launch version of Oblivion Remastered, the door shows seven children instead of five.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a change that left Elder Scrolls lore scholars scratching their heads, but it turns out it was likely just a mistake and not a major lore ret-con. While it's not listed in the patch notes, those playing the latest patch Steam Beta 1.2 update have noticed the door has been changed. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/oblivion-remastereds-latest-patch-stealthily-fixed-the-most-lore-breaking-door-in-videogames/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, it now sports a glowing red ambiance that more closely resembles the door from the original Oblivion and is now lore-accurate, depicting the original five children instead of seven.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest update to Oblivion Remastered isn't yet available for all platforms, but can be played early by those who own the game on Steam by opting into the game's Steam Beta version. In addition to the unlisted door change, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-next-update-will-add-a-brand-new-difficulty-option-full-patch-notes/1100-6533089/" data-ref-id="1100-6533089">update also adds a new difficulty option</a> and more performance optimizations.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-gets-its-first-update-with-a-whole-bunch-of-fixes/1100-6532121/" data-ref-id="1100-6532121">Oblivion Remastered's first major update</a> arrived in June and largely focused on addressing bugs and various technical issues. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">Oblivion Remastered review</a>, we said it is a worthy remaster, in part because it keeps many of the original Oblivion's rough edges that, if they were to be sanded down, would strip the open-world RPG of much of its charm.</p>

                <p>What's next for God of War director Cory Barlog and game developer Sony Santa Monica? According to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-394#post-142651128" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reporter Jason Schreier</a>, Barlog's game is the developer's "next big thing," adding that progress is "going well."</p><p>Basically nothing is known about what the game is. Some have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ip/1100-6525531/" data-ref-id="1100-6525531">it is a new IP</a>, but Schreier said that's not true. "It's not a new IP but it might feel like one. Maybe that's why people are confused," he said, adding that rumors that the project is sci-fi in nature are "nonsense."</p><p>Schreier went on to say that Resetera forum user Ashhong "knows what they are talking about." This person previously said Barlog's new game is <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-400#post-142662756" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"not a licensed game."</a></p><p>Sony Santa Monica's latest game was 2022's God of War Ragnarok, which Barlog worked on as the game's creative director after directing 2018's God of War. The studio didn't produce a trilogy to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-ending-the-norse-saga-after-two-games-is-like-the-lord-of-the-rings-box-set-barlog-says/1100-6496283/" data-ref-id="1100-6496283">help avoid the Norse saga dragging out too long.</a></p><p>After Ragnarok was released, Barlog said Sony Santa Monica was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-studio-has-multiple-projects-in-the-works/1100-6509199/" data-ref-id="1100-6509199">"spread out on a lot of different things,"</a> suggesting the company might have had multiple games in the works. In 2021, it was reported that the studio was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1z0r7i/sony_santa_monicas_cancelled_game_was_a_new_ip/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developing an open-world sci-fi new IP</a> before it was reportedly canceled.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica is <a href="https://careers.playstation.com/?keyword=santa%20monica%20studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently hiring for a number of roles</a> to support the development of a "new unannounced title," but the job listings don't reveal much about what the game is.</p>

Once we get our hands on the Pro 3, we'll update this article with our experience. At the moment, the Pro 2 is our top pick for Switch players who prefer this control layout. Similarly, this is how we felt about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate Controller</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-nintendo-switch-2-controller-amazon-prime-day-gaming-deal/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">testing the Ultimate 2 series</a>, which offers a markedly improved experience. In short, the Pro 3 should probably be on your radar.</p><hr><p>The 8BitDo Pro 3 costs $20 more than the Pro 2, but the $70 price point aligns with the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, the manufacturer's flagship controller that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections. The Pro 2, meanwhile, only supported Bluetooth wireless and didn't come with a charging dock. The new version is the first non-Ultimate controller with a charging dock. A 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored in the bottom of the dock. The Pro series has always felt like the alternative flagship option for those who favor PlayStation over Xbox control layouts, and the Pro 3's specs solidify that.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 can be viewed as an alternative to the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a></strong>. Nintendo's official controller feels great and even has a pair of back buttons, but there's no denying that 8BitDo's pair of premium gamepads are more versatile thanks to its suite of physical modifications and programmable customization options.</p><p>The TMR sticks on the Ultimate 2 are awesome, so it's exciting to see the tech added to the Pro series. 8BitDo's TMR sticks are noticeably smoother, more accurate, consume less power, and are said to be even more durable than the Hall Effect sticks found on the Pro 2, Ultimate, and other older controllers in the collection. Like Hall Effect, TMR sticks use magnetic sensors to register movements; this naturally reduces wear and prevents stick-drift issues from arising over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 has magnetic ABXY buttons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the TMR sticks, the Pro 3 mirrors the Ultimate 2's remappable buttons and trigger adjustments. It has two remappable back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons that are activated by microswitches. If you flip the switches on the back, the Hall Effect triggers become non-linear microswitch triggers. The latter shortens the pull distance, effectively turning the triggers into speedy buttons.</p><p>There are a couple of differences between the Pro 3 and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. The Ultimate 2 series has rings around the sticks with adjustable RGB lighting effects. The Pro 3 has an upgraded D-pad with improved tactile feedback. Interestingly, the G Classic edition has a series of raised ridges--three in each direction--whereas the purple and gray models have the familiar directional arrows instead.</p><p>The Pro 3 also has a customization option that will be a big deal for some players: swappable face buttons. Inside the box, you'll find a small tool to remove the magnetic ABXY buttons. You can then reverse A/B and X/Y to fit your preference for Nintendo's and Microsoft's button layout. Though the Pro 3 doesn't offer Xbox console support, you can use it for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well as for games you have installed on Steam Deck, Windows, mobile devices, etc. Xbox's control layout, with Y on top and A on the bottom, is generally considered the default for any platform not made by Nintendo or PlayStation.</p><p>With the Ultimate 2 series, you need to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCWSX17,B0DRCV3SPH,B0DRCWJSKZ,B0F9P4P6HB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the 2.4GHz-only model</a> to get the Xbox layout and the Bluetooth model for Nintendo compatibility. The Ultimate series has always had a separate 2.4GHz model for PC players and a slightly more expensive model that adds Bluetooth and Switch support. There's nothing wrong with that release model, especially for those who aren't interested in Nintendo consoles. But it's cool that 8BitDo created a built-in solution for those who have issues with Nintendo's control layout on other platforms. You could even remap the buttons after switching their locations to use Xbox's layout on Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337"></a><figcaption>The ball-top stick caps match each controller's theme. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532339,1300-4532340" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"></figure><p>According to 8BitDo, the ball-top stick caps were "made purely for fun," but we're looking forward to checking them out. Regardless of whether they feel practical to use, they look pretty cool on the Pro 3 and are themed around the controller's color. For instance, the retro gray NES/SNES-inspired model comes with a pair of red ball-top caps. If you opt for the GameCube-themed purple edition, you'll get yellow ball-tops.</p><p>With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 app, you can adjust stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivities, create dead zones, modify rumble intensity, and remap inputs. Up to three unique control configurations can be saved directly to the controller, and you can cycle through them on the fly by pressing the profile button.</p><hr><h2>8BitDo is having a big year</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353" data-ratio="0.35" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png"></figure><p>The Pro 3 is just the latest major addition to 8BitDo's impressive accessory lineup in 2025.
