                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-guardian-games-2025-adds-new-boss-rush-mode-rushdown/1100-6529969/" data-ref-id="1100-6529969">2025 Guardian Games</a> began earlier this week in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a>, but that event wasn't the only thing to arrive. Somehow, Bungie accidentally released some of its Rite of the Nine activities prematurely during the latest update. But the good news is that players will be able to keep any of the weapons they earned from completing those activities.</p><p>On Bungie's <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_03_13_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official site</a>, the devs chalked up the error to the will of the Nine, and added that, "Their will <em>is </em>their own." The company went on to explain that the Rite of the Nine activities accidentally leaked in Update 8.2.5 were in an extremely early state with temporary art and "fake perk rolls." The final versions of those activities will be more refined, and optimized for Explorer, Eternity, and Ultimatum modes.</p><p>Luckily, Bungie accepted the mistake with good humor, and noted that the early-bird weapons won't be removed from anyone's inventory. That said, the weapons will be modified a bit to prevent any rule-breaking combos. And they will be available when Rite of the Nine launches some time after the beginning of Heresy Act III.</p><p>In the meantime, Guardian Games participants can dive into the new boss rush mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-rushdown-guide-boss-rush-challenge-rewards-and-encounters-explained/1100-6530070/" data-ref-id="1100-6530070">Rushdown</a>. There's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-pvp-mode-heavy-metal-lets-you-finally-pilot-a-brig/1100-6529865/" data-ref-id="1100-6529865">a brand-new, limited-time PvP mode</a> called Heavy Metal that will arrive during Heresy Act III, which will finally give players their chance to pilot a Brig. Additionally, Bungie has shared more info about what to expect from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-new-rite-of-the-nine-event-is-for-dungeon-newcomers-and-veterans-alike/1100-6529863/" data-ref-id="1100-6529863">Rite of the Nine event</a>.</p>
