                <p>Just as the NFL playoffs heat up, Nintendo has announced that Madden NFL 26 will be available to try for free from January 15 through January 21 for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p><p>It's the full game, not a limited slice of it, that Switch 2 owners can play for the duration of the free period. All save data will carry forward if players buy the full game. Additionally, Madden NFL 26 is 60% off through January 25, bringing the price down from $70 to $28.</p><h2><strong>Madden NFL 26 free on Switch 2 times</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Starts:</strong> January 15 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET</li><li><strong>Ends:</strong> January 21 at 11:59 PM PT / 2:59 AM ET (January 22)</li></ul><p>Madden NFL 26 launched in August 2025 and has sold very well. It's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 6 best-selling game of 2025 in the US</a>, and it's no longer the only football game from EA, as the company revived its college football series in 2024. The latter series isn't released on Switch or Switch 2, however.</p><p>The Divisional round of the NFL playoffs begins this Saturday and run through Sunday, before the Conference Championships the following weekend. There will be a week off, and then Super Bowl LX takes place on Sunday, February 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.</p>
