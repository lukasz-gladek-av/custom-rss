                <p>Microsoft has debuted a new advertisement for Xbox Game Pass aimed at reminding people that they don't have to wait very long to play more games. The "New Games Added All The Time" ad focuses on a sad-looking, tired person sitting inside a disc-return box waiting for someone to return a game so they can play it. This is meant to highlight how people used to rent games at places like Blockbuster but had to wait, in some cases at least, for people to return their copies.</p><p>"That was then," the ad states before cutting to the person sitting at their desk at home and booting up a game from the Game Pass library. "Now, new games are added all the time," the ad says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5IJn83bV_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q5IJn83bV_8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft normally adds games to Game Pass across two waves each month, and there are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 850 titles</a> available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>While it's true Microsoft adds more and more games to the Game Pass library on an ongoing basis, the company also removes games twice a month as well. For October, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#consoleleavingsoon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the titles set for removal is Stalker 2</a>, and some people are complaining about this given it was heavily promoted by Microsoft as an Xbox console exclusive.</p><p>It's being removed this month presumably due to the expiration of an agreement, as the game lands on PS5 on November 20, which is exactly one year after the game came to Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced a huge price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, raising the monthly cost from $20 to $30. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">Game Pass Ultimate remains $20 at GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and others.</a></p>

                <p>A new study has revealed its findings on the carbon footprint of physical video games, and unsurprisingly, digitally downloaded games are considered to be more environmentally friendly in comparison to physical. French carbon-accounting firm Greenly studied the environmental impact of various systems and the production of video games, finding that physical copies of games are "100 times more carbon-intensive" than their digital counterparts.</p><p>According to Greenly, the manufacturing and transportation of physical games--with 1 million discs being used as an example--could produce 312 tons of carbon dioxide, while 1 million downloads of the same game--if it were 70GB in size--would equal three tons of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>"Although cloud-based gaming can be detrimental as a result of its need for continuous access to energy-hungry data servers, we also cannot neglect the continued impact of manufacturing and packaging physical video games," study author Stephanie Safdie explained to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/manufacture-and-shipping-of-physical-games-is-100-times-more-carbon-intensive-than-digital-new-study-finds" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "Ultimately, downloading a digital copy imposes emissions linked to electricity use at home, as well as the energy use of the concerned data center--but it does not have the same impact as the emissions created by the industry in terms of landfill and excessive waste, which are primarily still accounted for by physical consoles and hard disc copies of games."</p><p>Ultimately, the production of a physical game disc involves the extraction of rare earth metals and the production of plastic, which in turn requires the usage of machines, processes, and labor that contribute to the drain on resources. This includes the manufacturing of consoles, with Greenly estimating that these devices consume 3.9 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity a year in the US and are responsible for the production of 1.6 million metric tons of CO2e (Carbon Dioxide equivalent). Factor in television sets also running on electricity, and the ultimate impact of gaming across traditional consoles, mobile devices, and cloud gaming is significant.</p><p>So what's an environmentally conscious gamer supposed to do? Greenly found that handheld systems produce far fewer emissions--13.8kg CO2e per year with the Switch, for example--and the firm also suggested that companies look at methods to reduce their overall energy consumption.</p><p>This has been an area where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-energy-saving-graphics-modes-reportedly-being-explored-by-microsoft/1100-6508943/">Microsoft has been heavily focused</a> with its use of recycled materials and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-consoles-can-now-download-updates-in-energy-saver-mode/1100-6501492/">energy-saving power modes</a>.</p>
