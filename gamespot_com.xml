                <p>Even though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">inZoi</a>, the new life sim from Krafton that aims to be the first real competitor to The Sims, won't officially release until March 27, you can get a head start on the creation aspect of the anticipated new game with the free inZoi Creative Studio starting March 20. The Creative Studio won't let you do any of the simulation part of the game, but it <em>will</em> let you dabble with inZoi's character creation and build mode.</p><p>There's a little bit of a catch, though. For the first few days--March 20-23--you'll need to unlock access via streaming drop on Twitch or Chzzk, which will require you to link your Krafton account and watch an inZoi stream for 15 minutes, or on Steam itself. Steam will be the easiest option--you just have to watch a livestream from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inZoi's product page</a> for 30 minutes, and a key for the Creative Studio will be granted without remembering any additional logins.</p><p>There are only a limited number of keys that can be obtained from drops, but if they run out you won't have to wait too long. Starting March 23, the inZoi Creative Studio will become available for anyone on Steam to download for free. And you'll probably appreciate having the chance to go wild on character creation ahead of the release of the rest of the game, since inZoi features a rather intense level of customization built in--you can literally design your own clothing items from scratch, for one thing. It's a lot to absorb even without thinking about the simulation part.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Krafton hosted a very lengthy streaming showcase that went deep on everything inZoi will have to offer at launch, plus the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/" data-ref-id="1100-6530201">game's roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025, and you can check that out below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi launches in early access starting March 27 on Steam for $40. Krafton has said that until inZoi reaches its full 1.0 launch, all updates will be included in that price--so no paid DLC for this one for a while.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developers at GSC Game World have been through a lot, to put it mildly. Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russians-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">full-scale Russian invasion in 2022</a>, roughly 200 developers opted to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, continuing to collaborate with their colleagues in Kyiv. This, in theory, should have led to a more peaceful development process for this group, but a large fire in the Prague office threw another unexpected wrench in its plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The fire, which broke out in late 2023 in the Prague office's server room, partially wiped out one of the floors. No one was hurt, but post-accident images of the damage show scorch marks and ash covering the ground. GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych seems to view the situation as a sort of blessing in disguise, as he explained to us in the latest GameSpot Insider documentary.</p><p dir="ltr">"It actually made us stronger because we got to experience what can happen, how it may look--what we have to do to not let it happen again," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSH5O1KLSI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KSH5O1KLSI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There was certainly a material cost to the accident, though. In addition to the server on the floor being destroyed, developers' work computers were also destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one more challenge to rebuild this game again," lead community manager Yevhen Bazarov said. "One more thing we weren't expecting."</p><p dir="ltr">While he's able to laugh about it now, lead cinematic artist Ingwar Dovgoteles was working on a cinematic-department documentation job that took roughly three days. He had finished it late the night of the fire. About 15 minutes after he got home, he got a call from the office that everything he had worked on was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">"All my work was there," Dovgoteles added. "[Done] in three days with all this documentation. It was just wasted."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for GSC Game World, despite yet another setback, Stalker 2 did eventually release in late 2024, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">best games of 2024</a>.

potential business partners to help the company turn things around</a>, including Tencent. It recently came to light that Ubisoft might be looking at selling off individual game franchises, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA said to be in the mix.</a> Ubisoft has not commented on any of this.</p><p>Some of the pre-release discussion surrounding Shadows has been focused around the game's diverse cast of characters. Controversial business leader Elon Musk weighed in, prompting <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/assassins-creed-shadows-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis Cote to respond</a>.</p><p>According to Van Dreunen, the back-and-forth could benefit the game. "It's free press; this only makes the game more interesting to a lot of players, I'm sure," he said.</p><p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-denounces-online-attacks-after-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy/1100-6524573/" data-ref-id="1100-6524573">recently condemned</a> what he called "malicious and personal online attacks" against some of its developers, though he didn't name Assassin's Creed outright.</p><p>"I am proud to support the amazing work of our teams and partners, and I will always trust in their creative choices. We should all celebrate the hard work and talent that goes into making video games," he said.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a> scored the game an 8/10.

                <p dir="ltr">One of the largest labor unions in North America is creating a new United Videogame Workers union, which aims to allow anyone in the business to join. Communications Workers of America has teamed up with the American Federation of Musicians to launch this new gaming-specific organization to coincide with the start of the Game Developers Conference.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/faq" rel="nofollow ">the group's FAQ</a>, this new gaming union will offer basically anyone in the industry--in the United States and Canada--<a href="https://uvw-cwa.org/membership" rel="nofollow ">the opportunity to sign up</a> and then eventually pay dues. This is also open to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/">the thousands of people who have lost their jobs</a> over the past couple of years. The United Videogame Workers mission statement mentions taking "back our lives, our labor, and our passion from those who treat us like replaceable cogs; to empower our fellow workers; to link up arms with the laid off, with the freelancer, with the disillusioned contractor, with the disenfranchised and the marginalized, with the workers laboring invisibly to keep this industry afloat." The new organization also advocates for creating studio-specific unions, too, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/">like ZeniMax Workers United</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"The creation of this union was not done in isolation; it's a cumulative effort by the thousands of video game workers who have been fighting for years to redefine what it means to stand together and reclaim power in one of the largest and highest-grossing industries on the globe," said CWA's senior director of organizing Tom Smith in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time the CWA has made waves in the gaming industry. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/">Bethesda Game Studios became unionized</a> last year with the help of the organization. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/">the CWA went after Microsoft for allegedly firing QA testers</a> because they were attempting to unionize. Last but not least, in October, the labor union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-shutdown-just-another-example-of-bad-decision-by-highly-insulated-ceos-labor-union-says/1100-6527505/">criticized Sony's decision to shut down Concord developer Firewalk</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">video game voice actors went on strike</a>, and it's now going on its eighth month. Recently, SAG-AFTRA argued there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/"> too many AI loopholes for game publishers to use</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/#1">GDC</a> kicks off today in San Francisco.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Roger Craig Smith has voiced loads of iconic video game characters, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-dream-team/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/batman-arkham-origins/">Arkham Origins</a>' Batman, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/">Apex Legends</a> fan-favorite Mirage. He's perhaps best known for his performance as the ledge-climbing, leap-of-faith-taking Ezio Auditore da Firenze in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-ii/">Assassin's Creed II</a> (and several other games in the franchise), but fans of Assassin's Creed will likely be surprised to learn that Smith is absolutely terrified of ledges.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshualamb/2025/03/19/assassins-creeds-roger-craig-smith-i-have-a-fear-of-ledges/" rel="nofollow ">Forbes</a>, Smith--who is a big fan of gaming--was asked if there's a specific gaming memory in his life that "stands out." For Assassin's Creed fans, his answer was a bit unexpected.</p><p dir="ltr">"Climbing to the top of a tower in Assassin's Creed II and synchronising so the map unlocks for you; that iconic and sweeping entrance [to the game] always gets me," Smith said. "I have a fear of ledges, and this game would give me the heebie jeebies moving around up there. I'd get butterflies in my stomach, but it's such a beautiful moment. Getting to be a part of it and seeing what everyone had worked so hard to create was just such a 'Wow,' moment for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461733"></a><figcaption>Smith is afraid of heights--even in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4461733-eziocollection.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Smith also revealed which game he'd play for the rest of his life, if he were only allowed to play one.</p><p dir="ltr">"I'll cheat and say the entire Assassin's Creed franchise," Smith answered. "That'll give me at least a lifetime of gaming there. Aside from the fact that I got to be a part of the franchise so early on, I've always thoroughly enjoyed playing all of the games. The music, storytelling, visuals, gameplay--it all works so well, and that's rare to have everything fire off and hit the way those games do."</p><p dir="ltr">Smith did add that he hasn't had much time for gaming as of late due to being busy with work, saying that it's "no way to live," and that he needs to "turn [his] gamer card in."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Smith has always had a reputation for genuinely enjoying games. In the wake of Apex Legends' wildly successful 2019 launch, Smith and fellow Apex voice actor Chris Edgerly (who voices Pathfinder) did several livestreams together, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iOUS-vRI00">playing Apex and messing with unsuspecting teammates</a> by using their respective Apex characters' voices in voice chat.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, Smith seems extremely content with the state of his career. When asked if there are any video game voice roles he wishes he'd gotten, he simply expressed gratitude for the opportunities he's had in the industry.</p><p dir="ltr">"Lightning has struck so many times in my life and career," Smith explained. "I've been able to look people in the eye and tell them that I'm the voice of Ezio, Batman, and Sonic. In all honesty, I just look forward to the next project. It's amazing to think that there's somebody out there who loves games and storytelling and is creating something we can't even imagine that could become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/">the next Assassin's Creed</a>."</p><p>Speaking of the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches on Thursday, March 20, but you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">GameSpot's review of the latest entry</a> in the long-running series now.</p>
