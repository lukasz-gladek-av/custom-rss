In addition to firefights in the main cabin, players can climb on top of the train and fire away at enemies all the way on the other side. It's an exposed position, for sure, and there is always the risk of falling off the train as well. Players are also able to climb off the train's roof and down into the conductor's cabin to sneak up on enemies who may not see them coming.</span></p><p>Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/guides/blackops6/multiplayer-maps/call-of-duty-guides-black-ops-6-multiplayer-map-guide-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published an extensive blog post covering the Bullet map</a>, which includes recommendations for loadouts and gameplay tactics to give yourself the best chance to win matches and rack up kills.</p><p>Season 2 Reloaded's TMNT collaboration, meanwhile, brings the famous pizza-eating reptiles to Call of Duty, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-tmnt-skins-will-cost-you-90-to-unlock-in-total/1100-6529628/" data-ref-id="1100-6529628">costs about $90 to unlock all the new TMNT content.</a> As for the Pro Skater tease, the newly launched Grind map references some kind of forthcoming reveal, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">no big surprise given all the leaks so far. </a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a>, a new community feedback program through which the publisher aims to gather notes from fans about the state of the game.

                <p>NetEase is getting more aggressive when it comes to cracking down on the use of third-party plugins while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. It's now banning the use of an application called Blitz, although NetEase is being lenient in that it won't ban players who previously used the software.</p><p>A notice against using third-party plugins was put out on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250220/40955_1213199.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals' website</a> today, February 21. It specifically calls out Blitz, a third-party application that can be used while playing games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> to gain insight into informative data about competitive games that players can't typically see. In Marvel Rivals' case, NetEase says players using Blitz could see damage and healing statistics, predict the use of Ultimate abilities, and use it to help decide which heroes to ban in competitive play.</p><p>While it's not as aggressive as cheating software that helps players see through walls or always have precise aim, NetEase explained that "we deem this program as cheating software and will no longer allow its use during gameplay." Thankfully for the Marvel Rivals players who use Blitz, this ban is not retroactive.</p><p>"Players who have previously used this software will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games," NetEase explained. "To uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account, we strongly urge you to refrain from using any third-party plugins. Together, we can forge a vibrant and heroic gaming environment."</p><p>Marvel Rivals is available for free on PC, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The hero shooter recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-financials-reveal-marvel-rivals-topped-40m-players-before-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surpassed 40 million players</a> and added The Thing and Human Torch as new playable heroes today. Unfortunately, NetEase also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laid off the game's North American developers</a> earlier this week despite its success.</p>

                <p>In late 2019, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds creator Brendan Greene offered the first glimpse of his next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brendan-playerunknown-greenes-next-game-prologue-i/1100-6472284/" data-ref-id="1100-6472284">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>. Unlike PUBG, Prologue isn't a shooter or a battle royale. Instead, it's a survival game that pits players against bitterly cold elements and a treacherous environment. According to Greene, Prologue's extreme difficulty may cause some players to initially hate it, but he also believes they will eventually embrace it.</p><p>"I expect a lot of people will hate it," Greene told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/i-expect-a-lot-of-people-will-hate-it-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-doesnt-care-if-his-new-game-is-too-hard-for-players-to-handle-as-long-as-it-elicits-a-reaction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "But that's ok if it elicits a reaction--that's all I want. People didn't get [Battle Royale] at first, but then they did. And I think it's the same with this, the goal here is creating these big, massive worlds for everyone. We already have a demo on Steam, and people understand what it is. So, if it causes a reaction, fantastic. I'll happily talk to them and go, 'Well, yeah, it doesn't handhold because that doesn't serve a purpose.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447932"></a><figcaption>A camp fire keeps the player alive in Prologue.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4447932-prologuegowayback.jpg"></figure><p>The player's goal in Prologue is to live long enough to reach a weather station that's randomly located on an 8x8 km map. But in order to do so, players need to find the right gear and battle hunger and thirst as well. The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> indicates that there are "millions" of possible maps, so there isn't any single path to making it through alive. Regardless of whether the player succeeds or fails, the map will be different the next time they play. Prologue doesn't currently have a release date, but early access is expected to begin in the second quarter of this year. Players who want to get take part in Prologue's play tests <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2943740/view/523081871000600943" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can find more info here</a>.</p><p>Nearly a year ago, Greene and his colleagues at PlayerUnknown Productions revealed that Prologue is part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-three-game-plan-starts-with-a-survival-game-with-millions-of-maps/1100-6528255/" data-ref-id="1100-6528255">a long-term plan for three games</a>, which also includes a title called Project Artemis. Meanwhile, PUBG publisher Krafton and Nvidia have unveiled plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-and-nvidia-reveal-new-ai-powered-characters-designed-to-act-like-real-people/1100-6528667/" data-ref-id="1100-6528667">AI-powered teammates in PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</a> that can act like real people. Krafton is also working on the first-ever PUBG spin-off, which is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-spin-off-gets-a-new-name-and-more-details/1100-6529319/" data-ref-id="1100-6529319">PUBG: Blindspot</a>.</p>
