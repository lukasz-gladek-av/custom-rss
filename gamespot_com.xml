                <p>Coffee Stain, the publisher behind Goat Simulator, Valheim, and Satisfactory, has announced a new roguelike called Into the Unwell. In development at Swedish studio She Was Such A Good Horse, the game is designed to look like an early 20th-century cartoon.</p><p>Built around cooperative hack-and-slash mechanics, Into the Unwell focuses on chaotic gameplay and over-the-top enemies and environments. Its most striking feature is its art style, which specifically pulls on "rubber hose" animation associated with cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, and early Looney Tunes. Its aesthetic also seems evocative of the imagery of animated films like Alice in Wonderland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tBGtZXwM8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2tBGtZXwM8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>While similar in inspiration to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cuphead/" data-ref-id="5000-285254">Cuphead</a><span>, Into the Unwell is distinct in that it features 3D combat and platforming. The announcement trailer shows off some of the environmental challenges and boss fights that players can expect from the game, which seem from this short glimpse that they might be quite punishing.</span></p><p>According to a press release, the gameplay will also embrace the weird and psychedelic vibes of the aesthetics. Coffee Stain writes, "Players will find themselves in a cartoonish fever dream where they'll encounter eccentric anthropomorphic enemies, and attempt boss fights as bizarre as they are belligerent."</p><p>Into the Unwell is built to be played solo or with up to four players in co-op, and it is launching in Steam Early Access in the near future. It is the debut game from studio She Was Such A Good Horse, which is composed of a handful of veteran developers from across the games industry. No details have been shared about whether it is coming to other platforms beyond PC.</p>

                <p>RGG Studio's Project Century has new trailers and a new name, both revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>. Now dubbed Stranger Than Heaven, the game takes place in Japan during 1915. In the trailer, we get some looks at the scenery and nightlife of the time period, along with some glimpses of hard-hitting, bloody action gameplay.</p><p>The story trailer showcases our main character in a smoky nightclub watching a performance before going outside for a panoramic view of Japan, showing how modernization and increased international influence have transformed the country. While the previous trailer for Stranger than Heaven showed the time setting as 1915--the Taisho Era--this trailer indicates the action is taking place in 1943, which would be in the midst of World War II. This could be a sign that the game will take place over a lengthy period of time. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHUs5_vSYHY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dHUs5_vSYHY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also see our character, Daito, taking on some foes, including a choice of whether or not to show a character mercy--potentially indicating a choice/morality system. At the end, Daito converses with a clearly Western character--who even drops a 1940's slur asking about Daito's ethnic origins--only for Daito to reveal that he has blue eyes, something associated with Western heritage.</p><p>No platforms or a release date were mentioned, but we assume that Stranger than Heaven will be targeting current-gen consoles and PC.</p><p>Developing....</p>

                <p>The Wu-Tang Clan has long since been a multimedia group, putting their name behind comic books, a TV show, video games, and more. Now they're headed back to the world of gaming again with Wu-Tang: Rise of the Deceiver, a co-op brawler that has you rescuing the Clan from the Deceiver. Check out the latest trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826WlpkBZOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/826WlpkBZOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This 3D brawler has three core pillars according to developer Brass Lion: Rebuild Shaolin, Battle with the Wu, and Protect Ya Neck. Ghostface Killah asks you to rescue his Wu brothers so that you can battle alongside them and use their legendary skills to restore Shaolin, the home of Wu-Tang. As you progress, you'll collect jewels to customize your fighting style and from the description of the game, it sounds like you'll see your work reflected in the community of Shaolin.</p><p>The game sports an "afro-surrealist meets anime-inspired" art design and increasingly difficult battles against fantastical enemies through the "Chambers" of the world. The game sports a soundtrack that includes classic Wu-Tang tracks and new material overseen by producer Just Blaze. You can play with up to two friends for three-player co-op gaming.</p><p>No release date is available so far, but the game is set to come to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store when it does release.</p>

                <p>The highly anticipated mecha online shooter, Mecha Break, finally got a release date. Revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> show, players will be able to go toe to giant mechanical toe on July 1. And considering all of the "wonderful" feedback fans gave during its global open beta, the game seems primed to deliver an action-packed experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2MJY08p_ZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z2MJY08p_ZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed by Amazing Seasun Games, Mecha Break is set in an alternate future where various factions fight over Earth's sole energy source: a highly toxic mineral called Corite. Due to its volatile nature, Corite can only be handled by mechs. This forms the basis for the team-based battles in the game's main competitive mode. Potentially compelling story beats aside, players won't need a ton of motivation to jump into these large flying machines and wage war against each other across various battlefields next month.</p>
