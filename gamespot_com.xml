                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic is reportedly in discussions to sell its games division to Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely Inc for roughly $3.5 billion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">Scopely was acquired</a> by Saudi Arabia owned Savvy Games in 2023 for $4.9 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit?srnd=undefined" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, the deal could be announced in the coming weeks, although an agreement has not yet been made, so the deal could fall through. The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go. The company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-wizards-unite-is-shutting-down/1100-6497637/">Harry Potter mobile game</a> shut down in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">Niantic laid off 230 people in 2023</a> after canceling a Marvel project and shutting down NBA All-World.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in games in recent years. In 2022, it was reported that the country was looking to invest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-looking-to-invest-almost-38-billion-in-games-industry-could-acquire-a-publisher/1100-6507917/">$38 billion into video game companies</a> and it has made significant investments in companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/">Nintendo</a>. The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>. Recently, the company announced a partnership between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/" data-ref-id="1100-6529448">Major League Baseball and Pokemon Go</a> to place themed PokeStops in stadiums, in addition to some clubs hosting Pokemon Go nights during the baseball season.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has commented on Microsoft's relatively new strategy whereby it launches some of its first-party games on rival platforms, including PS5. For Microsoft, this is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">making money and bringing its games to more people</a>. It's also a win for PS5 owners, according to Yoshida.</p><p>"I think it's a win for PlayStation owners; they didn't have access [to those games] before," he said on the Sacred Symbols podcast, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshida-xbox-games-on-ps5-a-win-for-playstation-owners/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p>Yoshida was at one point managing Sony's first-party game production pipeline before he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/" data-ref-id="1100-6529536">switched positions to running the indies team</a>. When he was running first-party, Yoshida said it was a "nightmare" scenario for PlayStation to become "the minority platform" because that would make it "impossible to maintain the first-party development because the best creators would leave."</p><p>He added: "They are not just creatives, they are business people as well; they want their games to reach the biggest audience as well."</p><p>Microsoft, of course, is in last place as it relates to console sales among the big three, with PS5 and Switch sales outpacing the Series X|S. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-no-longer-trying-to-move-ps5-players-to-xbox/1100-6529532/" data-ref-id="1100-6529532">no longer trying to get PS5 owners to switch to Xbox</a> but instead wants to bring more of Microsoft's first-party games to PS5 to meet them where they are.</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing a more platform-agnostic strategy for many years already but only recently has the company actually begun releasing more and more games for PS5 and Switch. For its part, Sony continues to focus on exclusives for its own platforms, while also bringing more games to PC, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6143">day-and-date titles for its live-service games. </a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox game to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which comes to PS5 this spring following its debut on Xbox in 2024. After that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> comes out in May for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, launching on all platforms at the same time.</p><p>The RPG Avowed from Microsoft-owned studio Obsidian launched on February 18, but it has not been announced for any platforms outside of Xbox and PC.</p>

                <p>Microsoft and Xbox have <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/19/muse-ai-xbox-empowering-creators-and-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> their new generative AI model, Muse, which is the world's first <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-08600-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World and Human Action Model (WHAM)</a>. Muse's stated purpose is to help out studios by generating gameplay during the development process. Microsoft also claimed the technology might be capable of preserving long-unplayable games on obsolete systems.</p><p>It was trained using developer Ninja Theory's now-dormant and abandoned Bleeding Edge game. The developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-theory-drops-bleeding-edge-to-focus-on-hellblade-2-and-other-projects/1100-6486869/" data-ref-id="1100-6486869">dropped support for the game</a> back in 2021 to focus on newer projects. Ninja Theory partnered up with Microsoft Research due to their close proximity to each other in Cambridge, England. Muse used Bleeding Edge to learn about game physics and reactions to players' controller actions.</p><p>According to Xbox, Muse is used for gameplay ideation, and it's already being used to develop a real-time playable AI model trained on other first-party games. Xbox also mentioned how Muse could possibly take older games lost to time and older hardware from its first-party portfolio and optimize them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c15vxDHJ2lU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/c15vxDHJ2lU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Xbox claimed that Muse would help teams prototype new gameplay experiences during development and introduce new content. Xbox noted that it's up to its studios whether to participate in the use of generative AI based on their goals and vision, and acknowledged that AI won't be the single solution for every project.</p><p>For Ninja Theory, studio head Dom Matthews said, "It's not about using AI to generate content, but it's actually about creating workflow and approaches that allow our team here of 100 creative experts to do more."</p><p>The subject of AI still remains controversial. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">recent study</a> showed that a majority of game studios already use generative AI, but workers are concerned about how AI could impact their roles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft president Brad Smith</a> have said that the rise of AI would displace workers in the short term but lead to more opportunities in the long term. (Although not tied directly to AI, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">Microsoft laid off more than 2,500 individuals</a> in gaming roles last year.) Video game voice actors have also gone on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">strike due to concerns</a> about AI.</p>

                <p>Humble has launched an awesome new video game bundle geared toward retro enthusiasts. The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fcapcom-arcade-classics-fighter-pack&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-69-capcom-retro-games-for-only-20-for-a-limited-time%2F1100-6529572%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Arcade Classics and Fighters Pack</a> for PC is a treasure trove of some the best games from an era of coin-operated gaming. All told, this bundle includes 69 games for only $20,  which breaks down to 29 cents per game.</p><p>Unlike many Humble Bundles, the Capcom retro bundle doesn't have tiers; it's an all-or-nothing collection of Steam games that's available to purchase until March 11. The bundle supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. As usual, you can donate more than the minimum $20 and adjust the ratio of your donation between the charity, the publisher, and Humble.</p><p>If the number of games included sounds abnormally high, that's because the bulk of the inclusions are technically paid DLC within Capcom's pair of Arcade Stadium collections. Capcom Arcade Stadium is a free download, but adding games to the platform requires cash. With this Humble Bundle, you'll get a key for Arcade Stadium and Arcade Stadium 2 that instantly unlocks a wide assortment of games.</p><p>Capcom Arcade Stadium is a well-curated collection of '80s and '90s arcade games, including both Mega Man arcade games, great shoot-'em-ups such as 1943, classic platformers like Strider, and numerous entries from Capcom's popular fighting game series. In addition to several versions of Street Fighter 2, you're also getting the brilliant trilogy of Street Fighter Alpha games as well as Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo.
