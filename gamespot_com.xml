                <p>2026 looks to be a very exciting year for video games. In addition to being the first full year for the Switch 2--we'll surely hear about even more games for the system as we move further into the year--2026 will also see the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, which is widely anticipated as one of the biggest entertainment launches of all time. We'll see plenty of other sequels to popular franchises, as well as a number of brand-new games across everything from console to mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">In order for you to keep track of everything coming in 2026, GameSpot has broken down the entire year by month, showing games with final release dates as well as games given a nebulous "2026" window. As more games are announced, they'll be added to this list, and those given final dates will be shifted into the relevant sections.

                <p dir="ltr">Since the days of the PlayStation 3, players have been earning Trophies in their PlayStation games by completing challenges and finishing games, but outside of their online profiles, there hasn't been a way for the most loyal PS fans to show off those in-game achievements. Today, Sony has provided a solution in Franchise Rewards, a new program where unlocking certain trophies will give a player access to special physical "rewards."</p><p dir="ltr">The program kicks off today with <a href="https://ghostrewards.playstation.com/" rel="nofollow ">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, and it offers two pieces of unique merch for those who earn certain trophies by December 31. Players who have unlocked the "Mono no Aware" gold trophy can preorder a t-shirt for $30, while those who have unlocked the "Living Legend" platinum trophy can preorder a pin for $25.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573099" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573099"></a><figcaption>The Living Legend pin, available to those who unlock Ghost of Tsushima's platinum trophy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4573099-ghost-of-tsushima-living-legend-pin.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/23/ghost-of-tsushima-players-can-now-unlock-special-ghost-rewards-merchandise-for-purchase/" rel="nofollow ">new article on the PlayStation Blog</a> goes into further detail about the special merch, saying that both items were "created with close input from Sucker Punch Productions to make sure they authentically capture the game’s atmosphere and artistry." The blog post also confirms that Ghost of Yotei will join the program "later this year," with details on that merch coming "closer to launch."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Franchise Rewards program is new for PlayStation and Ghost of Tsushima fans, the idea of earning physical merch for in-game feats has been used by other games in the past. One notable example is Destiny 2, which allowed players to purchase exclusive apparel and other items when they finished newly added raids.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost of Tsushima's Ghost Rewards program begins today, while the sequel to Sucker Punch Studios's samurai epic, Ghost of Yotei, is set to launch October 2 exclusively on PlayStation 5.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>As part of the Beyond the Strand event celebrating 10 years of Kojima Productions, the Japanese developer and the original creator of Pokemon Go announced a "new technology partnership" that aims to "redefine immersive entertainment."</p><p>Like with Kojima's Death Stranding series, much remains shrouded in mystery about this new project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKyj6CDUH64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKyj6CDUH64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world," reads a line from the announcement.</p><p>Niantic Spatial is the new name of the Pokemon Go creator, which is now focusing more directly on AI and geospacial technology. The Pokemon Go development team and the game itself, meanwhile, were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">sold to Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>Kojima said his games today "exist on screens" but working with Niantic will allow the studio to "unleash those experiences into real-world experiences."</p><p>"I'm excited to collaborate on creating experiences where you can climb real mountains while finding entertainment there, and connecting with real friends. I'm excited that we can create these new experiences together," Kojima said.</p><p>During Beyond the Strand, Kojima said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-working-on-an-ar-walking-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) that this new experience will be "like the real Death Stranding, in the real world, where you can connect with people or connect with the actual environment there in your city."</p><p>Niantic boss John Hanke, meanwhile, said the company is now working on a "living model of the world that people and machines can talk to." This could allow for a "new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction," Hanke said.</p><p>To promote whatever this new experience is, Kojima Productions commissioned a live-action video called "A New Dawn" that stars actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9582703/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zane Haney</a> and was written and directed by Ei Uehara and Corey Finn.</p><p>Also during the Beyond the Strand event, Kojima Productions released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">new teasers for the Xbox-published game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">Sony-published game Physint.</a> Kojima also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-announcement-is-a-credit-card/1100-6534937/" data-ref-id="1100-6534937">announced a credit card.</a></p>

                <p>As part of the "Beyond the Strand" event this week that celebrated the 10th anniversary of Kojima Productions, Hideo Kojima made a series of announcements, one of which was quite unexpected.</p><p>Kojima is parterning with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to launch a new Kojima credit card. In the second half of 2026, MUFG will offer a credit card that will give users points based on spending that they can use to exchange for merchandise and other goods for Kojima-related items.</p><p>That's all Kojima and the bank had to say about the credit card. Additional details will be forthcoming.</p><p>Presumably this card will only be available in Japan, but if you're interested in a gaming credit card and live in the US, you have a few options to choose from. Microsoft offers an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-credit-card-is-available-now-free-game-pass-bonuses-points-fees-and-everything-else-you-need-to-know/1100-6518085/" data-ref-id="1100-6518085">Xbox credit card</a> and Sony offers a <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-credit-card/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation credit card</a> and each offer bonuses specific to their platforms.</p><p>Also during the Beyond the Strand event, Kojima Productions released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">new teasers for the Xbox-published game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">Sony-published game Physint.</a> Kojima also announced a partnership with former Pokemon Go developer Niantic to create a new experience.</p>

                <p>The console wars have reached a point where it's no longer uncommon for some of the biggest Xbox games to get a cross-platform release on PS5. A small handful of PlayStation 5 titles have also gone to Xbox Series X|S. But if you were hoping that meant games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> were next in line for Xbox releases then you might be disappointed.</p><p>A user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/horizon_zero_dawn_coming_to_xbox/?share_id=FOpL6AxDrIyGryTk06DAx&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found a listing for Horizon Zero Dawn on the German Xbox Store. And it's not the only Sony title to appear there. Unfortunately, as pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/comment/nfeiai3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by other Reddit users</a>, this appears to be an indexing mistake by Google rather than Microsoft. Even some Nintendo games are listed on the Xbox Store because of that error.</p><p>Regardless, porting games from PS5 to Xbox Series X|S may not be a bad idea. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">worked wonders for Helldivers 2</a>, and dramatically driven up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">the number of players in the game</a>. In short, it made Helldivers 2 an even bigger hit. Sony also shares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-comments-on-deal-to-bring-mlb-the-show-21-to-xbox-and-game-pass/1100-6489820/" data-ref-id="1100-6489820">MLB The Show</a> with other platforms thanks to agreements made with Major League Baseball. However, Sony is under no such obligation to bring any of its top franchises to the competition.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox Studios has seemingly opened the flood gates for games that were formerly exclusive titles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> was recently released on PS5, following in the footsteps of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft hasn't put all of its AAA games on PS5 yet, but it's no longer out of the question for franchises like Halo to eventually make the leap as well.</p>
