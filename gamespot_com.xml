The studio fired between 30 and 40 staff members from offices in the United Kingdom and Canada earlier this week. The terminated employees were reportedly attempting to unionize when they were let go.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> broke the story, and added that all of the fired employees were part of a private trade union chat group on Discord. According to a spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, the group was a mix of members who had already joined the union and others who were trying to organize a union at Rockstar.</p><p>"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry," said IWGB president Alex Marshall in a statement. "This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."</p><p>A spokesperson from Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said that it supported Rockstar's decision and alleged that the employees were terminated "for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><p>This seems like the kind of dispute that may ultimately be settled inside of a courtroom, depending on what the British and Canadian courts have to say about it. This may take a long time for this to play out.</p><p>Rockstar Games recently shared a job listing which predicted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/" data-ref-id="1100-6534732">GTA 6 will have the biggest launch</a> in video game history. That seems very likely considering that Grand Theft Auto 5 passed 215 million in sales earlier this year, and GTA Online continues to be a cash cow for the company.</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-talks-possibility-of-another-delay-and-teases-multiple-other-rockstar-games/1100-6533875/" data-ref-id="1100-6533875">he isn't worried about AI competing with GTA</a>, and he's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-says-ai-is-great-but-people-are-overstating-what-it-can-do/1100-6535679/" data-ref-id="1100-6535679">pretty consistent in his assessment of the technology</a>. </p><p>GTA 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

                <p>Today is Halloween, and what better way to celebrate than with a handful of spooky games. Humble Bundle is offering 13 games for $13 ($114 value) with their <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Findie-fears-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Fears Bundle</a>. $13 gets you all the games on offer, but as always with Humble Bundle you can choose to pay more. If you do, portions of the proceeds get donated to charity. The Indie Fears Bundle benefits SpecialEffect, a UK-based charity whose goal is bringing video games to all disabled gamers around the world. This bundle is available until November 21, so you have plenty of time to pick it up.</p><p>One of the most notable inclusions here is Mouthwashing, which took the indie horror game community by storm when it came out last year. It sports a retro PS1-era graphical style and sees you play as a crew member of the space freighter <em>Tulpar,</em> delving into its mysterious crash landing by exploring the ship, chatting with your crewmates, and solving puzzles. It's more of a narrative-focused walking sim than a survival horror game with combat, but it's still a tense, scary game perfect for the season.</p><p>Then there's Arctic Eggs, which also features a purposefully downgraded graphical style (countless indie horror games do this, and I love it). In it, as the name implies, your goal is to fry eggs and cook breakfast for folks in a near-future dystopian Antarctica. The frying mechanics aren't the easiest to master, and you'll often have to fry weird items like bullets and cigarettes for the denizens. It's a relatively short game, but the story and setting and just weird and interesting enough to stay engaged.</p><p>Also available is Terror at Oakheart, a love-letter to 80's and 90's slasher films complete with a rip-off of the nursery rhyme from A Nightmare On Elm Street in the trailer. This is a 2D sidescrolling game with a visual style that would feel right at home on the Game Boy Advance. It's an action-adventure game with a nonlinear story that sees you taking control of both the killer and the victims, a unique take on the genre.</p><h2>Indie Fears Game Bundle</h2><ul><li>Adios</li><li>Arctic Eggs</li><li>The Boba Tea Shop</li><li>Buckshot Roulette</li><li>Daemonologie</li><li>Kiosk</li><li>Massacre at the Mirage</li><li>Mouthwashing</li><li>NO-SKIN</li><li>Order 13</li><li>Terror at Oakheart</li><li>THRESHOLD</li><li>Who's Lila?</li></ul><hr><p>Several other <span data-embed-type="buylink" data-size="buylink__embed" data-collection="%7B%22text%22:%22bundle%20deals%20are%20available%20at%20Humble%22,%22monetizedUrl%22:%22%22,%22rawUrl%22:%22https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/1804712/2059850/25796?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.humblebundle.com/bundles%22%7D">           <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;buylink|embedded-link&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+13+PC+Games+For+%2413+With+the+Indie+Fears+Humble+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+10%3A54%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+15%3A33%3A05&amp;fnarticle_id=6535858&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbundles&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-13-pc-games-for-13-with-the-indie-fears-humble-bundle%2F1100-6535858%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click">bundle deals are available at Humble</a> </span> right now, including a few more with horror, mystery, and dystopian games.

Some players use all four at the same time, while others only connect one on each side. Since they are removable, you have that choice.</p><p>The paddles are the main draw for a lot of players, but the Elite Series 2 also has customizable sticks and directional pads. It comes with six swappable stick caps for the higher-quality metal analog sticks. You can adjust the tension on both sticks with the included tool. It's worth noting these are not Hall Effect sticks, so just like with the Xbox Wireless Controller, stick drift is a possibility. I've never had any issues with my Elite Series 2, but it can happen.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 has a unique, circular 8-way D-pad designed for quick movements. It can take some time to get used to it, but you can swap it out for a conventional 4-way D-pad. In addition to the swappable components, the Elite Series 2 has switches on the back to lock the triggers (RT and LT) to three different stopping points.</p><p>You can create three different control profiles using the Xbox Accessories App. Control layouts save to the controller and can be cycled through on the fly. Along with remapping the paddles and other controls, you can adjust stick sensitivity, vibration intensity, and more.</p><p>Unlike the Xbox Wireless Controller, the Elite Series 2 has a rechargeable battery and can run for up to 40 hours. You can charge it via USB-C or by placing it on the magnetic charging dock. The braided USB-C cable is roughly nine-feet long and can be stored in the carrying case's mesh compartment.</p><p>The Elite Series 2 released in 2019, but it's still the best premium controller for Xbox and PC. I've tested dozens of these types of controllers for all major platforms, and I have yet to find one that matches the Elite Series 2 in the ergonomics and overall feel departments. It's one of the rare controllers where the difference is immediately noticeable due to excellent weight distribution, textured grips, and sturdier shell.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594497" data-ratio="0.72571428571429" data-width="700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594497"></a><figcaption>Xbox Elite Series 2 Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594497-eliteseries2accessoreis.jpg"></figure><p>The Elite Series 2 previously retailed for $180, but it received a $20 bump in May when Microsoft raised the price of Xbox hardware and first-party accessories in response to the US tariff situation.

<section><p>Typing games have come a long way since Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Keyboards have more than 100 keys, but there are four that are most important to people who play video games: W, A, S, and D. There are games that use more than these keys, yes--StarCraft, League of Legends, and World of Warcraft use all sorts of combinations--but the majority of games rely on a small sampling of numbers and letters on the keyboard. There are practical reasons for this, to be sure: Computer games often require one hand on a mouse, the other on a keyboard. There are a ton of keys that are simply out of reach. If you've got two hands on the keyboard, you're probably not playing a video game. But you <em>could </em>be.</p><p dir="ltr">Typing games have existed for decades, once largely considered educational tools designed to help kids learn to use a keyboard. Millennials played games like Typer Shark and Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing in their computer lab classrooms, before computers were commonplace in home offices. As computers, namely laptops, started to proliferate, computer labs started to disappear--and so did the need for educational typing games. But from the ashes of the computer lab, typing games have reemerged, pulling from the educational genres toolbox while putting a new spin on the niche genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, released in 1987 and developed by Software Toolworks, is <em>the</em> quintessential typing game. It wasn't the first typing game, but it was among the first. Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing is certainly the most prominent; Mavis herself is the face of the typing genre, even today.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the high concept--the idea that the world's best typing teacher was at your side, correcting mistakes and offering encouragement--was a big part of the appeal [of Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing," developer on the game Michael Duffy told GameSpot. "The 'game' sensibilities that we successfully employed in Chessmaster--graphics and music--made the rote repetition required to learn a new motor skill fun. The typing hands showing finger placement were highly innovative in a time of primitive graphics, and kept people from looking at their hands while typing. But the illusion of Mavis herself was a big draw."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594001"></a><figcaption>Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing courtesy of Softonic, one of the few online store fronts hosting the software.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594001-ff%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing had several games that made it more than just a typing program: Road Race, Space Junk, and Ragtime. Each of these were largely the same--typing a prompt that scrolled across the screens--but applied different effects. Tying fast made the text scroll faster in Road Race; accurate typing helped shoot more stuff in Space Junk; and Ragtime required the player to type in rhythm with a metronome. The small tweaks to how typing impacted the states of these games is what makes them satisfying, and those same practices in making typing feel responsive and tactile in games continues to drive what makes a typing game good.</p><p dir="ltr">Z-Type is a classic type-to-shoot game originally developed in just one week by Dominic Szablewski. He said his game is appealing because of the immediate feedback. Z-Type is an arcade-style space game in which players must shoot enemy spaceships. If they hit you, you're done. It plays in rounds, with each round adding more enemies coming at you faster and faster. What makes this a typing game is that each of the enemy spaceships has a word, and some shoot letters. When you hit the first letter of a word, your spaceship shoots. So when you hit a lot of letters--typing about the letters that spell "condescending," for instance--explosions abound.</p><p dir="ltr">"Typing/shooting and seeing lots of explosions is just cool," Szablewski said. "The timing, sound effects, and graphics have to be just right to make it feel good. I spent a lot of time fiddling with these things until I had something that I liked. It's very hard to put into words, but once you have a good game loop, it just clicks."</p><p dir="ltr">He continued: "I love games that are 'easy to learn, hard to master.' Once you get better at these games, you can reach this almost zen-like state where you totally forget where your actions just 'flow' without thinking." Z-Type is perfect at creating that feeling--it just feels really good to be good at this game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594003"></a><figcaption>Phoboslab's Z-Type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594003-ff%282%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's exactly the feeling Elecom developer Mike Smith wanted to employ in his upcoming typing beat 'em up Keys of Fury. "I got very excited about the idea of making a typing game that was face-meltingly awesome," he told GameSpot.</p><p dir="ltr">Smith's Keys of Fury, which had a demo go live during the most recent Steam Next Fest, is part of the next generation of typing games, following classics like Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing and Z-Type and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484680/typing-keyboard-indie-games-textorcist-nanotale" rel="nofollow ">more recent typing hits like Nanotale and Keyboard Sports</a>. Developers are pushing the boundaries of what typing games can be, often blending genres to create something entirely new. In Keys of Fury, typing enacts the action-packed fighting. In Touch Type Tale, by Pumperknickle Studio, real-time strategy meets typing. Blood Typers, from Outer Brain Studios, used typing to power its survival horror gameplay, whereas in Glyphica: Typing Survival, typing is how you blast off waves of enemies in roguelite rounds, like an amped up Z-Type. Final Sentence, which ended the Steam Next Fest at the top of the charts, blends the battle royale formula with the genre.</p><p dir="ltr">The keyboard is not just a means for playing the game; it's central to it. "I wanted every keystroke to matter so that you get a lot of satisfaction just as you push a 'punch' button on a controller," Smith said. "I wanted every keystroke to matter. There's that immediate, satisfying attack and sound effect."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyboards are essential to many PC games, so it makes sense that typing as a mechanic would translate into all different sorts of genres. For Malte Hoffman of German developer Pumpernickle Studio, which made the 2024 release Touch Type Tale, a real-time strategy game made perfect sense to blend with typing game elements--RTS games like Starcraft 2 already use a whole lot of keyboard buttons for their various hot keys. That's how the Pumpernickle team started thinking about the idea: What if you could play a real-time strategy game with the keyboard alone? No mouse necessarily, not even to control the menus.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas a lot of older typing games focus primarily on typing fast, it's more important to be accurate in a game like Touch Type Tale. "It certainly helps if you're very fast at typing, but there's a limit," Hoffman told GameSpot. "Beyond that, typing faster doesn't help you much. Your brain is slower, because you have decisions to make." A great typing game, he said, has more opportunity than just fast typing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594004"></a><figcaption>Button Mash's Final Sentence.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594004-ss_de700af3d234ba5f74ba4c791345628e59af30cf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Sentence, from Button Mash, is another game that rewards accuracy; the battle royale certainly requires the typist to go fast, but typing accurately is equally as important. That's because, like other battle royales, Final Sentence is a multiplayer online game, and only one person can win. The setup is quite intense: Groups of 40 to 100 players enter a dimly lit room, each with their own typewriter and man with a gun. Typewriter for typing, sure. But the man with the gun? He's there to shoot you if you make too many mistakes. The catch, however, is that if you don't type fast enough, you also die. The game got so popular during the Steam Next Fest that developer Dmitry Minsky spent the entirety of the event pushing buttons on the game's Amazon Web Services console to add more and more servers.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a lot like the typing minigames from Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing, actually. Except for the gun. Minsky said he knew the audience was huge for typing trainers like MonkeyType or TypeRacer, where people can test their words-per-minute. But there's backspace there. It's tense, he said, but you can always fix your mistakes. "Here, the tension is so huge that you feel it," Minsky said. "You're always stressed."</p><p dir="ltr">It's that sort of tension that drives Blood Typers, the survival horror game from four-person developer Outer Brain Studios. Blood Typers, which was released in February and had a new update go live in October, is clearly inspired by Typing of the Dead, but entirely off rails and high-stress, bloody survival, cooperative gameplay. The feeling of a gurgling zombie stumbling toward you creates a similar rush and tension: You type or you die.</p><p dir="ltr">"Typing is such a physical activity," Blood Typers developer Dmitry Pirag told GameSpot. "The physicality of it just works with the horror, and taps into something where it feels even more immersive, because you know that you're in control of every action. It's extremely skill based."</p><p dir="ltr">But Pirag said that Blood Typers had different modes that change the way the player experiences difficulty. You can make the typing elements more forgiving, giving you time to hunt and peck for keys, while also turning up the survival horror elements to make the game more difficult in a different way.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, though, if a game's system doesn't "get out of the way and let the player type," as typing roguelite Gylphica: Typing Survival developer Xuanming Zhou said, it doesn't matter how innovative it is. Mixing roguelite with typing works because neither piece gets in each other's way, he said, adding, "One is a control system; the other is a progression system."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594005" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594005"></a><figcaption>aliasBLACK's Glyphica.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4594005-ss_cdd249dc74d96291c52d4baadad2f829f6a42c67.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The goal of Glyphica is to get out of the players way and let them type," Zhou said. "A roguelike progression system enables exactly that. Unlike genres defined by control schemes that might conflict with typing, roguelike mechanics fit perfectly without compromise."</p><p dir="ltr">Glyphica: Typing Survival feels like Z-Type in some ways--the player controls a turret that fires at enemies flying toward you in the middle of the screen. Each enemy has a word displayed on it, and typing that word means firing at them. Hit them before they hit you. But Glyphica: Typing Survival adds onto the classic game with its roguelite elements: the upgrades, loot, and weapons that scale with the hordes. There's a frenetic tension between the skill and speed of typing, blended with the dice roll of roguelite upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">This next generation of typing games is pulling what it needs from like eras before. But it's that past that's helped lay the groundwork necessary for the future of typing games--a future where the keyboard is a peripheral and a gameplay mechanic. Zhou said it could be called a resurgence. "Several typing games have done reasonably well recently, helping to gather a ready audience for the genre," he said. "That's probably created more confidence in the commercial vitality of typing games, reducing the risk for developers exploring them."</p><p dir="ltr">Typing games are still a niche genre, and may remain so: Typing on a keyboard isn't nearly as ubiquitous as it once was--smartphone and tablet typing has replaced the physical keyboard for some people. But a generation of people have that nostalgia for typing, and that's worth something.</p><p dir="ltr">"What connects all these games is the joy of typing, right?" Touch Type Tale developer Hoffman said. "Typing just feels satisfying. It's a great mode to connect with something that's already done, which is games. Exploring the space [and] using this great input method of typing [to play games] has a lot of opportunity."</p>

                <p>Last month, Supergiant Games officially launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2</a> out of early access, and sent the princess of the underworld, Melinoe, on a quest to defeat the titan Chronos. The original ending of the game wasn't very well-received. But in Hades 2' first post-launch patch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-coming-to-post-launch-patch-1-for-hades-2/1100-6535684/" data-ref-id="1100-6535684" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-coming-to-post-launch-patch-1-for-hades-2/1100-6535684/">the true ending</a> may give fans a better conclusion than the previous finale.</p><p>There have been some sizable additions to build up to the true ending, including new events and voiceovers, as well as changes to the fated prophecy adjustments, and the ability to use a cauldron incarnation to take you back to an earlier point in the game. However, the true ending will require a higher number of Underworld clears than before. The game's epilogue isn't being changed.</p><p>The specific changes involving the special encounters have been marked as spoilers by Supergiant. Without giving any story points away, one character may appear less frequently, and one will appear more often.</p><p>Although the game's initial ending proved divisive, GameSpot's review for Hades 2 gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">a perfect 10/10 score</a>. Near the end of September, Hades 2 reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-passes-110000-concurrent-players-on-steam-doubling-all-time-peak-for-original/1100-6535081/" data-ref-id="1100-6535081" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-passes-110000-concurrent-players-on-steam-doubling-all-time-peak-for-original/1100-6535081/">a new peak of concurrent players on Steam</a> with over 112,000. Supergiant has also thanked players <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/505090299391902120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for all the community feedback</a> that led to the improvements in the first patch.
