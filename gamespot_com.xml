                <p>In 2013, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-resigns/1100-6405525/" data-ref-id="1100-6405525">stepped down as EA's CEO</a> following a tumultuous six-year run on top of the company. During Riccitiello's reign, Activision's Call of Duty franchise overtook Battlefield in terms of popularity, and it didn't help when Riccitiello <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/article/unitys-ceo-devs-pay-per-install-charge-fps-gamers-per-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that Battlefield players should be charged to reload</a>. Now, ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has shared his belief that Riccitiello was the worst CEO in the video game industry.</p><p>During a joint appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit</a> with former EA Chief Creative Officer Bing Gordon, Kotick revealed that Activision was afraid that Gordon would assume control of EA and prove to be a good leader for the company.</p><p>"I'm not saying this because [Gordon is] sitting here," said Kotick. "Our fear was always that Bing was going to run [EA]. And we would have paid for Riccitiello to stay a CEO forever... like we thought he was the worst CEO in video games." Gordon also noted that Riccitiello may have hastened his departure from EA as well.</p><p>Regardless of his feelings about Riccitiello, Kotick said that there were multiple attempts in the past to bring EA and Activision together as a single company.</p><p>"[EA] tried to buy us a bunch of times. We had merger conversations," recalled Kotick. Later in the podcast, Kotick admitted that Activision thought that EA's "business [was] in a lot of ways was better than ours," before Gordon pointed out that Blizzard's business is even better than EA's.</p><p>During that same interview, Gordon recalled that EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/" data-ref-id="1100-6529398">passed on the chance to buy Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and Blizzard</a> before Activision ultimately swept up all three. Kotick also called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">the Warcraft film one of the worst movies</a> he's ever seen and explained why it was a mistake for Blizzard to focus so much attention on that project.</p>

                <p>According to Activision founder Bobby Kotick, Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger was at one point in time interested in buying Nintendo, or at least interested in exploring the idea of buying Nintendo.</p><p>Kotick said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MN7nJdijzjfcP232NsHZF?si=mHGPjwjXQMiFbuZZEWcgqA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grit podcast</a> that Munger was not a fan of video games, but saw an opportunity to potentially make a bid for Nintendo. Munger is said to have floated the idea of spending some of Berkshire's immense holdings on making moves in the video game space. One of Munger's ideas, apparently, was to buy Nintendo.</p><p>"He goes, 'You know, I was looking at a couple other companies in your sector. I think if we bought yours, we should buy that company Nintendo, too,'" Kotick recalled. "He said, 'Have you guys looked at it? I was like, 'Yeah.' It was trading [at the time] at like 13 billion, with 7 billion in cash. He goes, 'You know, I don't think anything is gonna go really bad before I'm dead, and then if it goes bad after I'm dead, they'll just chalk it up to the folly of an 82-year-old, so you don't have to be so concerned about disappointing me."</p><p>This came about at a time when the French conglomerate Vivendi was forced to sell its stake in Activision, and Berkshire Hathaway was in the mix to buy it. That didn't happen, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-completes-buyback-from-vivendi/1100-6415550/" data-ref-id="1100-6415550">Activision ultimately bought itself back from Vivendi</a>.</p><p>During one of his weekly Friday lunches with Munger, Kotick asked for advice on how to structure a buyback from Vivendi. It was at this time that Munger reportedly said he wanted to fund the buyback. When he got up to go to the bathroom, Activision's Brian Kelly said to Kotick that if Munger--an adept investor--wanted to buy the stake, then he and Kotick should want that as well. And that's eventually what happened.</p><p>"He didn't like the business [of video games]," Kotick said of Munger. "He thought it was a step removed from gambling. He's like, 'You know, you're preying off people's addictions.' And I was like, 'I'm not. I'm actually giving them joy and fun, and if you ever tried a video game, you'd see that.' He always had this... little bit of an aversion."</p><p>Of course, Berkshire did not buy Nintendo. As for Munger, he passed away in 2023 at the age of 99. Berkshire Hathaway currently has more than <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-berkshire-hathaway-own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$325 billion in cash</a> and could theoretically try to buy pretty much any company on the open market, but it has not signaled any intent to buy a video game company.</p><h3><strong>Microsoft also tried to buy Nintendo</strong></h3><p>More than 20 years ago, Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo. Then-CEO Steve Ballmer sent staff to Japan to broach the idea, and the team apparently got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-tried-to-acquire-nintendo-square-and-midway-years-ago/1100-6485939/" data-ref-id="1100-6485939">laughed out of the room.</a></p><p>Berkshire did make a very big investment in the video game space in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/investing/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-activision-blizzard-microsoft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought almost 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard</a> just before Microsoft announced its intention to buy the company. Berkshire paid an average of about $66.50 per share, and that price surged tremendously after Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision Blizzard. The deal was ultimately approved at $95 per share, so Berkshire no doubt made a very big profit on the investment.</p><h3><strong>Game Pass issues</strong></h3><p>Also in the interview, Kotick discussed Microsoft's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, saying he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella "got the deal done in three days." Of course, it took more than a year for regulatory approval, but the framework was apparently decided in just 72 hours. The only disagreement Kotick and Nadella had around the deal focused on Microsoft's vision for Game Pass.</p><p>Kotick mentioned how World of Warcraft has been successful with its $15/month subscription cost, and that's just for one game. "Why would I put that into a Game Pass?" Kotick said. "I said to these guys, 'Why trade our flexible business models where you can do what's actually in the best interest of the customer.' I didn't believe in that. But the beauty if you're Microsoft... you can take that bet."</p><p>Kotick is not the only higher-up who has questioned the economic realities of Game Pass, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836">Devolver Digital have spoken critically of the service since day one.</a> Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick has also discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">launching new games in Game Pass makes no sense for the company</a>. There are examples, too, of Game Pass actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">helping to drive game sales outside the subscription</a>, and Doom creator John Romero just recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">Game Pass doesn't hurt companies</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously acknowledged that Game Pass can, in some cases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">cannibalize game sales</a>--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">not in every case</a>.</p>
