                <p>Funday Games has announced that Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor will leave early access on PC and launch its 1.0 version on September 17.</p><p>Since it launched into early access back in February 2024, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor has received four major updates, including the new biomes Azure Weald and Salt Pits, as well as a new game mode called Masteries.</p><p>However, the developer recently also stated that the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2321470/view/543352686106378649" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Endless Mode has been postponed</a>. This was due to technical difficulties and having to rebuild parts of the game using a new technical foundation. It would have rewritten how the game functioned and eventually started to drag the developers down. While Endless Mode isn't gone, the studio has prioritized reaching 1.0 first.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDnQNFn6vIk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EDnQNFn6vIk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Our dedicated community has been instrumental in making this happen, helping us shape the game it is today and being involved in activities such as our Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor Ultimate Challenge Invitational," said producer Jacob Laurits Besenbacher Kjeldsen. "It’s been a fantastic journey and we can’t wait to show you what we have cooked up for the 1.0 launch."</p><p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactics-vampire-survivors-style-game-excels-by-giving-you-something-new-to-do/1100-6521414/" data-ref-id="1100-6521414">Vampire Survivors-style game that separates itself from its contemporaries with its mining mechanics</a>.

                <p>Alongside the premiere of Black Mirror Season 7, Netflix has launched a video game based on one of the episodes--and yes, it ties back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-bandersnatch-time-travel-is-about-fixing-yourse/1100-6464185/" data-ref-id="1100-6464185">Bandersnatch</a>. Users can play the game as the events of the episode unfold and experience the delight and horror of the Tamagotchi-like Thronglets in real time.</p><p>While Netflix has been in the video games business for a minute, this is the first time users can play along with an episode. The game, Thronglets, is presented as a piece of lost Tuckersoft media that was canceled in 1994. However, the game was recently rediscovered, and players must take care of their Thronglet creatures, which multiply at an alarming rate.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ7tXCvTfWE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sJ7tXCvTfWE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Then things get more complicated as you manage an ever-growing population of the little yellow guys," <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/black-mirror-thronglets-mobile-game-news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix</a> explained. "There's always a carrot at the end of the stick to pull you along, be it an upgraded tool, a new type of building, or a thermonuclear device."</p><p>The game is described as "part virtual pet, part village manager, part strategy game, and part existential conundrum." Like most cozy-type games, it starts simple enough, where the player has to care for a fuzzy yellow little creature. Feed it, play with it, and give it a bath when it’s been rolling in the dirt. Do this well enough, and it’ll split in two. Keep everyone happy and it'll keep multiplying. Again and again. And Again.</p><p>Netflix adds that you don't even need to have watched the episode (Plaything) or have played Bandersnatch before starting up Thronglets. Players might get caught off guard when unlockable video diaries featuring Tuckersoft's creative genius Mohan Tucker (Asim Chaudhry) start popping up. The references might not hit the same way and maybe not make the most sense if you're uninitiated.</p><p>Black Mirror Season 7 is now streaming its six episodes on Netflix. The Thronglets game is now available via mobile app stores, included with Netflix.</p>

                <p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio have announced that Fragpunk will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on April 29.</p><p>Fragpunk is out on PC but suffered a last-minute <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fragpunk-gets-last-minute-delay-on-console-pc-version-launching-as-planned/1100-6529914/" data-ref-id="1100-6529914">delay on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Console players will be compensated for the delayed launch and receive the rewards from exclusive time-limited events since the beginning of Season 1 until April 29. Those who purchased the Pioneer Bundle on console platforms will also be eligible to claim additional gifts after the console launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Umxovn2sU0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Umxovn2sU0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fragpunk has cross-play and cross-progression between the console and PC versions, with more details coming as the launch date nears. The console versions also have enhanced aim-assist to minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard-and-mouse inputs. This was done to ensure an equally competitive environment for all players regardless of platform.</p><p>Season 1 of Fragpunk is in full swing so be sure to check out its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fragpunk-battle-pass-season-1-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6308/" data-ref-id="2900-6308">battle pass rewards</a>. Fragpunk is a free-to-play hero shooter that utilizes a card system with various abilities. The card selection changes every round and can be mixed and matched to create different combinations.</p><p>Bad Guitar Studio is also a subsidiary of NetEase, which earlier this year, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">reportedly trying to sell off its non-Chinese studios</a>, but the company claimed that it was still committed to its overseas developers.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has released a new Xbox commercial directed by Oscar-nominated director David Fincher and Romain Chassaing that carries a message: "Wake up the human inside." </p><p>In the video, we see a person named Horatio who lives his daily life like a rat, going from task to task with little energy or excitement. That is, until he gets home and plays Xbox. Then he's happy again.</p><p>"A much-needed dose of fun transforms him into the human he always was," the ad states.</p><p>This is a sad take on existence and what it takes to be happy, but tracks with some of the material that Fincher is known for--mainly the themes of some of his movies like Fight Club, Seven, and Gone Girl.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEv-s1dWGEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEv-s1dWGEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the ad, we see people using handheld gaming devices, and Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">working on one of its own right now</a>, but whether or not this video is teasing or referencing those plans is unknown.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">Xbox-branded gaming handheld device is reportedly on tap for release this year</a>, but it has yet to be announced.
