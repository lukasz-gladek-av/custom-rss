                <p>The most traditional input throughout the lifespan of Battlefield has been a controller. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6 </a>has full support for mouse and keyboard on PC as well as consoles, a majority of the playerbase will head into battle with a controller in their hands. Due to the popularity of controllers, Battlefield 6 offers a wide range of input settings, including some brand-new options that haven't been seen before in the franchise.</p><p>It can get a little daunting trying to go through all of the available controller settings, so if you want to set all of them correctly and head straight into the action, we have you covered. Below, you'll see a list of every major controller setting in Battlefield 6 and what you should be using for those settings.</p><h2>Best controller presets in Battlefield 6</h2><p>For starters, you'll want to head into the "Settings" menu of Battlefield 6, which is done by pressing the cog icon at the top of your screen. Once you're in Settings, go to the Controller section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>This brings you to a large image of your current controller layout. Here, you can choose to "Edit Presets" or "Edit Settings." Choosing to edit your presets allows you to simply go through all six of the available controller schemes and decide what buttons you want assigned for every action in those schemes. You can also "Edit Keybinds" by clicking edit presets, which allows you to change every single keybind within a specific controller scheme individually.</p><p>While you can customize everything to your liking, the simplest way to go about your controller schemes is by using the following presets:</p><ul><li><strong>Controls</strong>: Default</li><li><strong>Buttons</strong>: Alternate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943" data-ratio="0.558984375" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544943"></a><figcaption>The basic controller settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544943-386bdfb69134c736d1188a83789bd073.jpg"></figure><p>By going with the "Alternate" buttons preset, you're swapping some key actions on your controller. The Alternate preset makes it so your Melee button is now assigned to B/Circle and your Crouch/Prone button is assigned to the right joystick on the "Soldier" controller scheme. This has always been the most popular way to play first-person shooters, but you can, of course, switch this back to default if that's what you're used to.</p><p>However, you really don't want to switch back to default in the "Vehicles" and "Aircraft" schemes. By swapping these to the "Alternate" preset, you change the left joystick to turn/yaw left and right instead of moving backward and forward. This makes it much easier to control aircraft and ground vehicles in Battlefield 6, and should result in you crashing less.</p><p>The other schemes can also be set to the "Alternate" buttons preset, but they're not as important.</p><p>Once you're done switching your presets, you can now press "Edit Settings," which launches you into an entirely new section of your controller options.</p><h2>Best control settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>After clicking "Edit Settings," you can click on "Control Settings" in each of the different sections. Specifically, you want to click Control Settings within the "Infantry" section, as this changes how your character moves, aims, and shoots in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955" data-ratio="0.561863743148" data-width="2554" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544955"></a><figcaption>The Control Schemes menu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544955-f641fa1cb2992114ffd16b99f5cd1792.jpg"></figure><p>In the Infantry Control Settings menu, you can change your aiming sensitivity, field of view, aim assist, and general movement settings.

In this section, select the "Controller Tuning" option.</p><p>Here, you can set all of your controller deadzones and vibration settings. These settings are always crucial to nail down in an FPS, so look below for the general options you should be using:</p><p><strong>Controller Vibration</strong></p><ul><li>Vibration: Off (unless you personally enjoy it enabled)</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Left Stick</strong></p><ul><li>Center Deadzone: 10 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)</li><li>Axial Deadzone: 15</li><li>Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Right Stick</strong></p><ul><li>Center Deadzone: 10 (and work your way up depending on your controller's stick drift)</li><li>Axial Deadzone: 15</li><li>Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><p><strong>Controller Triggers</strong></p><ul><li>LT Deadzone: 0</li><li>LT Max Input Threshold: 100</li><li>RT Deadzone: 0</li><li>RT Max Input Threshold: 100</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544957" data-ratio="0.56147220046985" data-width="2554" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544957"></a><figcaption>Setting the right Controller Tuning settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544957-3a4ec7bfa8fd12c2b757a87abc3d54fa.jpg"></figure><p>The Gyro and Flick settings in the Controller Tuning menu don't need to be messed with unless you're actively using those features.</p><p>With that, you now have all of the best controller settings to use in Battlefield 6. These settings could change after the game has launched and the community has time to find the most optimal values, but for now, you can easily head into battle with these settings and not worry about a thing with your controller.</p>

                <p>The Battlefield franchise has always been known for its high-quality graphics, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> is no different. From what we've seen so far, PCs will be pushed to their limits, and a high frame rate might be difficult to achieve if you're not using the best graphics settings.</p><p>Fortunately, that's where we come in. We'll be listing off every single one of the PC graphics settings in Battlefield 6 and letting you know what you should set each one to. This will not only give you a great-looking game, but it will also allow you to play at a high FPS and get the most out of your PC.</p><h2>Best graphics settings in Battlefield 6</h2><p>To get started with your graphics settings, go to the main menu screen in Battlefield 6 and click on the cog icon at the top of the screen. From here, click the "Graphics" section on the left side of the screen.</p><p>Here, you'll be able to change around all of the general graphics settings, including choosing what resolution you play at and which monitor Battlefield 6 appears on. These settings are going to be more personal for every player, but you can find a list of our best settings for the general graphics menu below:</p><p><strong>Graphics</strong></p><ul><li>Graphics Quality: Custom</li><li>Brightness: 50-60</li><li>Sharpness: 75</li></ul><p><strong>Camera</strong></p><ul><li>Field of View: 105-110</li><li>Vehicle 3rd Person Field of View: 83</li><li>Weapon Field of View: Wide</li><li>World Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Weapon Motion Blur: 0</li><li>Camera Shake Amount: 20</li><li>Chromatic Aberration: Off</li><li>Vignette: Off</li><li>Film Grain: Off</li></ul><p><strong>Display</strong></p><ul><li>Fullscreen Mode: Borderless or Fullscreen</li><li>Fullscreen Device: Your preferred monitor</li><li>Fullscreen Resolution: Your preferred resolution from the monitor you're using</li><li>Aspect Ratio: Auto</li><li>Refresh Rate: Maximum Hz of your monitor</li><li>Vertical Sync: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975" data-ratio="0.56360078277886" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544975"></a><figcaption>The main graphics settings menu in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544975-fe83912e6fb099ad597a10f9cb79e849.jpg"></figure><p>There are other sections further down in the graphics menu, but they only relate to your HUD. Change them as you see fit, but they can be left alone for the most part.</p><p>Moving on, if you scroll back up to the Graphics section of the menu, you can click on "GRAPHICS" to modify each individual setting. This allows you to raise or lower the graphical fidelity of Battlefield 6 by changing settings that have a high or low impact on your PC's performance.</p><p>You can see a full list of these settings and what they should be set to below:</p><p><strong>Graphic Settings </strong></p><ul><li>Texture Quality: High</li><li>Texture Filtering: High</li><li>Mesh Quality: Low</li><li>Terrain Quality: Medium</li><li>Undergrowth Quality: Low</li><li>Effects Quality: Low</li><li>Volumetric Quality: Low</li><li>Lighting Quality: Low</li><li>Local Light &amp; Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Sun Shadow Quality: Low</li><li>Shadow Filtering: PCF</li><li>Reflection Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space Reflections: Off</li><li>Post Processing Quality: Low</li><li>Screen Space AO &amp; GI: Off</li><li>High Fidelity Objects Amount: Medium</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976" data-ratio="0.55660847880299" data-width="2005" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544976"></a><figcaption>Customizing the individual graphics settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544976-68cd1e35a19f117f41bbf8a7aa12c02e.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, if you want the most frames per second possible, then just set every single setting to its lowest value. Our settings will still give you a decent frame rate, but they also keep your game's graphical fidelity high so you can see objects and enemies more clearly.</p><p>Finally, back out of the "GRAPHICS" settings and look right below the "Brightness" and "Sharpness" settings in the graphics menu. Here, you'll see an option called "ADVANCED." Click on it and you'll be brought to a new menu where you can change your upscaling and other performance options. Look below for the optimal settings in this menu:</p><p><strong>Advanced Settings</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed Resolution Scale: 100</li><li>Frame Rate Limiter: On and set to your maximum refresh rate (160,144, 240, etc.)</li><li>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency: Enabled + Boost</li><li>Upscaling Technique: DLSS for Nvidia users / FSR for AMD users</li><li>Upscaling Quality: Quality for better visuals, Performance/Ultra Performance for the highest FPS</li><li>Nvidia Frame Generation: Off (adds too much input lag)</li><li>Future Frame Rendering: Off</li><li>Performance Overlay: Off</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977" data-ratio="0.56281800391389" data-width="2555" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544977"></a><figcaption>Going through the upscaling options in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4544977-b736cb8b816eb2eee044551e3d5dc719.jpg"></figure><p>Your choice of upscaling depends on your graphics card's brand and whether you want to run Battlefield 6 at a native resolution. You can also run Nvidia Frame Generation if you have a capable RTX GPU, but the added input lag is noticeable, so you'll have to decide if the extra frames are worth it.</p><p>With that, we've covered every available graphics setting. If you want to keep customizing your settings, make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-controller-settings-in-battlefield-6/1100-6533742/" data-ref-id="1100-6533742">best controller settings in Battlefield 6</a>.</p>

As for what dinosaurs will be available for viewing in their (sort of) natural habitat, the DLC's website confirmed the following, with more to be revealed later:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Apatosaurus</li><li dir="ltr">Brachiosaurus</li><li dir="ltr">Dimorphodon</li><li dir="ltr">Gallimimus</li><li dir="ltr">Mosasaurus</li><li dir="ltr">Pteranodon</li><li dir="ltr">Stegosaurus</li><li dir="ltr">Tyrannosaurus rex</li><li dir="ltr">Velociraptor</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The DLC will take place just before the events of 2015's Jurassic World, with the park on Isle Nublar ready for opening day but without all the guests, and will feature all of the park's iconic structures as well as functioning monorail system. Isle Sorna, the setting for The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 3, will also be available for flyby, where players will be able to see the ruins of various Site B facilities used to create the park's dinosaurs.</p><p dir="ltr">Jurassic World: Archipelago is developed by Orbx Studios and will be available directly through the Orbx Direct website (where it sells other Flight Simulator DLC) or in-game through the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 marketplace.</p><p dir="ltr">It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, as well as other first-party Microsoft titles, would soon be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">coming to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

                <p>EA Sports has officially unveiled NHL 26, and as with any new sports game, the cover star reveal is a major part of the announcement. Matthew Tkachuk of the Florida Panthers graces the cover of the game, but that's not all. The game's Deluxe edition features both Matthew and Brady Tkachuk, along with their father, Keith.</p><p>Brady is the captain of the Ottawa Senators and Keith is an 18-year NHL veteran who retired in 2010 after playing for various teams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4544966-nhl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544966" data-ratio="1" data-width="2160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4544966-nhl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544966"></a><figcaption>The Tkachuk family.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4544966-nhl.jpg"></figure><p>The cover of last year's NHL 25, meanwhile, was a family affair as well--Jack, Luke, and Quinn Hughes all appeared together on the game's Deluxe edition.</p><p>NHL 26 launches on September 12 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. EA Sports is promising better gameplay and presentation, along with updates to the Be A Pro mode, among other things.</p><p>Matthew Tkachuk has won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Panthers.

                <p>The QuakeCon 2025 free-play event for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-online-review/1900-6415741/" data-ref-id="1900-6415741">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is officially live and runs through next week, ending on August 12. During this <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-time event</a>, players on <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/freeplay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC/Mac, Xbox, and PlayStation</a> can dive into the world of Tamriel completely free of charge. This is a perfect opportunity for new and returning adventurers to explore ESO's massive universe and dynamic gameplay without any cost.</p><p>Throughout the event, players will have full access to the ESO base game. This includes four powerful classes--Sorcerer, Nightblade, Templar, and Dragonknight--as well as 24 adventure-filled zones filled with plenty of quests and dungeons to keep you busy. Players can also participate in competitive PvP experiences through Battlegrounds and the epic-scale Alliance War. Whether you're a solo explorer or a team-focused warrior, there's plenty to experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojDai6GBR8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ojDai6GBR8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you've taken part in a previous free play event, your progress is preserved, allowing you to continue your journey right where you left off. New players who create an ESO account during the event will receive 500 complimentary Crowns, which can be used to purchase various items and upgrades in the in-game store--not a terrible start to your new adventure.</p><p>To keep playing, you can purchase the full version of The Elder Scrolls Online through the Buy Now page. As a bonus, both the ESO base game and the 2025 Premium Edition <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68503" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">are currently on sale</a>, so there's no better time to continue your adventure across Tamriel.</p><p>In other Elder Scrolls news, the developers behind Skyblivion have stressed that their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">unofficial project is a full-scale remake</a> of Oblivion rather than a remaster.</p>
