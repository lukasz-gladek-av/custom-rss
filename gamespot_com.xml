                <p>World of Warcraft is one of the most enduringly successful video games of all time. It's been up and running--and generating monthly subscription revenue--for 20 years this month. But could developer Blizzard ever release a sequel instead of updating and expanding upon the existing game?</p><p>Game director Ion Hazzikostas told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/world-of-warcraft/after-20-years-of-wow-updates-will-blizzard-ever-need-to-wipe-the-slate-clean-maybe-at-some-long-distant-point-but-the-mmo-has-already-been-totally-rebuilt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that at some distant point in the future, Blizzard might consider wiping the slate clean with a new game. But World of Warcraft 2 is not happening anytime soon, if it ever does.</p><p>"Theoretically, at some long, distant point down the line, that may be a question we grapple with seriously," he said about the possibility of needing to start over with a sequel for the benefit of the game and community. "But, for the time being, we have a huge, vibrant, and growing player community that we're excited to serve."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="992057398" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

perspective.</p><p>"We're constantly tearing out some old foundational system and replacing it with something that will scale to support our new server architecture, to support new graphics pipelines, to support new aspects of multiplayer interaction that the original game couldn't have imagined," he said.</p><p>The priority for Blizzard right now is to "keep serving" the millions of players as best they can. "We are making the improvements that we think suit the modern audience best," he said.</p><p>Plenty of live-service-style games have come out with sequels, including Overwatch, Destiny, and Counter-Strike, but World of Warcraft is sticking with what works for the time being.</p><p>Blizzard did, at one point long ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-why-blizzards-titan-was-canceled-report/1100-6526867/" data-ref-id="1100-6526867">attempt to make another MMO via its Titan project</a>. It was ultimately canceled, however, and some of the work went on to materialize in Overwatch.</p><p>In addition to a sequel, some are wondering if Blizzard might bring WoW to console. Following Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, a Blizzard developer said the team was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-on-console-might-have-some-renewed-hope/1100-6518932/" data-ref-id="1100-6518932">thinking about the possibility of putting the game on console</a>. "It would be very insincere to say that we're not, like… of course we're talking about that," WoW executive producer Holly Longdale said. "We are Microsoft now."</p><p>WoW's tenth expansion, The War Within, was released in August and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-review-stay-awhile-and-listen/1900-6418275/" data-ref-id="1900-6418275">GameSpot called it one of the game's best yet.</a> The War Within's next major update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">goes full goblin mode.</a></p><p>Read more about Wow:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">After 20 Long Years, WoW Is Getting Player Housing In Its Midnight Expansion</a></li></ul>

                <p>Twenty years ago this month, Valve released Half-Life 2. The company is celebrating the anniversary with a <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">20th anniversary update</a> that includes new content and various bug fixes. Best of all, Half-Life 2 is free right now on Steam, but only until 1 PM ET today, November 18.</p><p>One of the most exciting additions for the Half-Life 2 update is new commentary tracks (spanning 3.5 hours) for the entire game featuring the original Half-Life 2 developers discussing how they brought the game to life. Additionally, Half-Life 2 now has in-game Steam Workshop support, along with support for Steam's new Game Recording feature. The update also fixes various issues with the 20-year-old game, including holes in the game world and disappearing objects. Players can also expect "cleaner, smoother horizon lines" and higher-resolution lightmaps across the entire game.</p><p>What's more, players can choose original graphics settings for blood and fire effects or new ones that were released later. There is also a High Quality mode that's been added, while the aim assist feature has ben overhauled to help it feel better.</p><p>Something else to know is that Half-Life 2's Episodes 1 and 2 are now part of Half-Life 2 itself, and due to this, Valve said it will be "reducing the visibility" of the standalone versions on Steam. They will now appear inside the Tools menu on Steam.</p><p>In addition to the update, Valve partnered with former GameSpot video producer Danny O'Dwyer's Secret Tape for a two-hour documentary about Half-Life 2. In this feature, Valve discusses the game's origins, development, and legacy, and of course, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-writer-shares-episode-3-details/1100-6452861/" data-ref-id="1100-6452861">fabled Half-Life 2: Episode 3</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-half-life-2-episode-3-hl3-update-canceled-ice-gun-1851701011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reports</a> that in the documentary, Valve discussed why Episode 3 never saw the light of day and even revealed new footage of the game. Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and would have focused on a ship, Borealis, that went missing.</p><p>The game was in the works for six months, but amounted to a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and only containing some story elements. However, writer Marc Laidlaw said the team was "running out of fuel" and ultimately decided to abandon Episode 3 altogether as the team worked on finishing Left 4 Dead, which would be released in 2008 to great success. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="323">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?start=323" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Valve engineer David Speyrer said the "tragic and almost comical" part of Left 4 Dead's success was that, "By the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, 'Well, we missed it. It's too late now." </p><p><span>Speyrer said that in hindsight, Valve made the "wrong decision."  He said, "W</span><span>e could have definitely gone back and spent two years to make</span> Episode 3<span>." </span></p><p>While Valve never made Half-Life 2: Episode 3, the company did create a new Half-Life game, the VR title Half-Life: Alyx. It was released in 2020 to critical acclaim, and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">GameSpot's Game of the Year.</a></p><p>In other news, the Half-Life 2 20th anniversary update has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">helped Half-Life 2 reach a new concurrent player record on Steam.</a></p><h2><strong>Half-Life 2 20th anniversary patch notes:</strong></h2><p><strong>Content:</strong></p><ul><li>Added 3.5 hours of Developer Commentary by members of the Half-Life 2 team.</li><li>Half-Life 2: Episode One and Episode Two are now playable from the Half-Life 2 main menu.</li><li>Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has been added to the Extras menu.</li><li>Added Steam Workshop support.
