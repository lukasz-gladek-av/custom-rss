                <p>It's been almost 10 years since The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt hit consoles. While the next installment in the series is still a ways away, CD Projekt can't wait to show fans what it has in store for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which has officially entered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">into full-scale production</a>.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, CD Projekt higher-ups--including CEO Michał Nowakowski and vice president of technology Charles Tremblay--confirmed that The Witcher 4 will be "bigger" and "better" than The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," said Trembley. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than The Witcher 3, it will be better than Cyberpunk--because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back."</p><p>Another thing the company doesn't want to go back to is how it markets the game. It wants to only begin the game's marketing campaign until it's truly ready, something it learned the hard way with Cyberpunk 2077. Nowakowski noted that they will still release teaser videos and other "crumbs" to stir reactions from fans to secure those preorders. However, it seems like the large-scale, big-budget trailers and assets will be reined in until the studio has a more solid release date in mind.</p><p>"I want to stress: it doesn’t mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]," said Nowakowski. "Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>No plot details of The Witcher 4 have been revealed, but at least CD Projekt management said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/">development on The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should be smoother</a> because the foundation will already be in place. CD Projekt management also mentioned how The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should take about three years each to develop, so fans can expect this newest Witcher trilogy to span into the 2030s.</p>

Drew, who divulges new information about the midseason update for Zombies. The developer reveals Citadelle des Morts contains a big focus on magic, and the map's unique Wonder Weapons will be four elemental swords. Drew describes the map as being large, but it does feature a lot of claustrophobic spaces within the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, the Tesla Storm field upgrade and Vulture Aid perk returns from past Zombies modes. Players will also have a new ammo mod and 18 new augments to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin Drew confirms some quality-of-life changes for the big Zombies update as well. This includes reduced Mangler spawns at mid-to-high rounds, as later rounds of Zombies are currently flooded with Manglers beyond round 25, making high-round attempts very frustrating for players. Treyarch is also including a cap on active Manglers up to Round 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the Vermin and Parasite rounds of Zombies take a long time to complete due to slow-spawning enemies, but Drew revealed the special rounds will become shorter after the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says more Zombies details will be revealed with the Season 1 Reloaded patch notes, which should arrive closer to the big update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>. The cinematics also set up a narrative that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/past-call-of-duty-zombies-storylines-will-collide-in-black-ops-6-dlc/1100-6528073/">merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines</a>.</p>

Across a series of social media posts, David said he's aware there "may be something new" in the works, but claims he knows nothing official.</p><p>"I don't know any more than all of you. I hear there may be something new and, if so, I'd love to reprise my role as the Arbiter. That's it. Nothing coded," <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862258022627852457" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p><p>David voiced the Arbiter in 2004's Halo 2, reprising the role in 2007's Halo 3 and 2015's Halo 5: Guardians. He's also known in the world of video games for voicing David Anderson in the Mass Effect series and as the self-referencial Vice President Keith David in Saints Row IV. This year, David took over for the late Lance Reddick as the voice of Commander Zavala in Destiny 2.</p><p>Also on social media, David said he understands if people don't believe him, but he maintains that he <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862305036321378387" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not know about any future Halo games and has not signed an NDA.</a> Instead, he's waiting to hear from Microsoft, and went on to say he'd love for one of the new Halo games to be an <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1861942846338809878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arbiter spin-off.</a></p><p>Outside of Halo and video games in general, David is known for voicing the Disney villain Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog, along with his hundreds of appearances for film and TV in projects like Armageddon, The Thing, They Live, and Platoon, among numerous others.</p><p>In other Halo voice actor news, it recently came to light that Microsoft was apparently thinking about parting ways with Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes and Cortana actress Jen Taylor for Halo 4. However, Downes said Microsoft decided to hire him and Taylor again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/master-chief-actor-says-halo-4-almost-recast-his-role-and-cortanas-with-new-voice-actors/1100-6528030/" data-ref-id="1100-6528030">after test audiences didn't like what they heard</a> from the actors hired to replace them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that 343 Industries had changed names to Halo Studios and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo games were in the works</a> and are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been announced, though. So far, Microsoft has only released footage from a demo called Project Foundry that aims to show off what is possible with Halo running on Epic's Unreal Engine.</p><p>The latest Halo game was 2021's Halo: Infinite, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">debuted to record-breaking numbers thanks to Game Pass but has since cooled off.</a></p><p>Microsoft's new Halo leadership is attempting to distance itself from Halo Infinite, saying the way that game was developed represented the "last remnant" of how Halo games were made. "That was our recipe. And what we're doing right now is changing our recipe," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">the studio said about its future projects.</a></p>

                <p>As usual, Call of Duty is getting a holiday update, and some of the first details for what's going down in Black Ops 6 have now arrived. As part of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Q2r0XSMkcA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new COD POD from Activision</a>, the company showed off the first look at a holiday-themed makeover coming to Black Ops 6's Nuketown map.</p><p>As you can see, the map has been taken over with festive decorations and is covered in snow. Nothing has been confirmed yet, but there will likely be a number of holiday-themed store bundles to buy to help get in the festive spirit as well.</p><p>There is no word yet on when Black Ops 6's Nuketown holiday makeover will go live, or any other themed activities, but that should be relatively soon considering the holidays are fast approaching. Beyond Call of Duty, it's expected that other popular live-service games, like GTA Online, will have holiday events on tap as well. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>Also coming to Black Ops 6 later this year is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/" data-ref-id="1100-6528158">crossover with Netflix's Squid Game</a>, timed to tie in with the debut of Squid Game Season 2.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">cinematic trailer for the Citadelle des Morts Zombies map</a>.
