                <p>We've known since the beginning of Chapter 6 Season 1 that we'd be getting a Godzilla skin with the battle pass in January. But it looks like this collaboration is going to be a lot bigger than you might have expected. Like, a <em>lot</em> bigger--judging by the short teaser Epic Games just dropped, there will be a skyscraper-sized Godzilla roaming the battle royale island starting this week.</p><p>It's not the most shocking news, since a Godzilla-sized Godzilla is a fairly logical thing to expect from a game that's had <a href="https://youtu.be/ZuY_X5ALrak?si=a7C69amDs0FzmKA3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">kaiju-sized monsters and mechs on the island in the past</a>, but it's cool to see the confirmation even so.</p><p>It's pretty clear, however, that there's still plenty more to this collab than we know about right now. For one thing, this collab is with Legendary Pictures for its Monsterverse franchise and last year's Godzilla x Kong--it would be pretty reasonable to expect both a King Kong skin in the item shop and a large King Kong boss on the battle royale island to battle Godzilla. And there are plenty of other potential kaiju from that franchise that could get skins, like Mechagodzilla and the Scar King.</p><p>The Godzilla skin is included with the Chapter 6 Season 1 battle pass starting Jan. 17, though it will require a little bit of grinding to unlock. But, unlike in past seasons, you won't need to do any specific quests. Instead, Godzilla will be unlocked by earning XP in any experience--no need to play battle royale at all if you don't want to.</p><p>The timing of Godzilla's arrival is amusing, since this week is also bringing us the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku-themed Fortnite Festival Season 7</a>. Miku famously fought Godzilla in <a href="https://youtu.be/wPayU7s-G5Q?si=XZk4D637ia5xbAgH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a video from one of the Project DIVA rhythm games</a>, and so this is a bit of a serendipitous pairing.</p>

                <p>The announcement and reveal of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is likely to be one of the biggest gaming stories of 2025. Earlier this month, Genki inadvertently became a part of that story when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">the company showed off a Switch 2 mockup</a> at CES. Now, a report claims that Nintendo sent over some lawyers to Genki's booth over those Switch 2 mockups.</p><p>Journalist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuKVsoHCgXk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julien Tellouck</a> was the first to report about Nintendo's lawyers getting involved over the incident. He also related that someone at Genki told him that the company brushed off the lawyers because there was no non-disclosure agreement signed with Nintendo.</p><p>"I talked to the guy from Genki just behind me, he told me that Nintendo had stopped by with lawyers--they had nothing to be reprimanded for because they had never signed a paper with Nintendo--no confidentiality agreement, no NDA," said Tellouck.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">subsequently issued its own statement</a> which said, "The gaming hardware that Genki claims to be Nintendo hardware at CES is not official and was not provided to the company by Nintendo." While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a Genki representative expressed surprise at the story and shared the company's belief that what was shown had already been leaked beforehand.</p><p>The stakes for Nintendo are extremely high, as one analyst believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-many-units-the-switch-2-could-sell-in-2025-in-the-us/1100-6528704/" data-ref-id="1100-6528704">that Switch 2 can sell 4.3 million consoles</a> in the US alone this year. Another report suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">Nintendo may unveil Switch 2 as soon as this week</a> for a possible summer launch. But until it actually happens, the rumors will continue to fly.</p>

new battle pass to level up. Activision hasn't revealed the details of the pass, but that information will likely be released closer to launch.</p><p dir="ltr">If Season 2 follows past Call of Duty seasons, the update will likely include new maps, modes, seasonal challenges, and more DLC weapons to unlock. Season 1 Reloaded is wrapping up with the ongoing Squid Game event, and it's possible that Season 2 will also have limited-time events and IP crossovers.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Anti_cheat_updates">Anti-cheat updates</h2><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Ranked Play modes for multiplayer and Warzone are infested with cheaters, and Activision has acknowledged that there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-devs-say-ricochet-anti-cheating-measures-did-not-hit-the-mark/1100-6528554/">some problems with Call of Duty's Ricochet anti-cheat system</a>. The publisher also revealed that there are major upgrades to Ricochet that will be launching with Season 2 and 3, so hopefully those updates will finally oust the hackers in both games.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h2><p dir="ltr">While we don't have any specific announcements for multiplayer, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes-revert-some-of-last-weeks-changes/1100-6528739/">January 9 patch notes</a> for Black Ops 6 revealed a few anticipated fixes scheduled for Season 2 of Zombies. This includes an update to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic on the Terminus map again, which will revert the change made that patched this method in the January 3 update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Season 2 update should also provide a proper fix for the frustrating Vermin double-attack bug, which was previously listed as being fixed in recent patch notes, but the problem persisted for players. The developer commented on the issue by saying, "Sometimes bugs appear fixed in testing but turn out to still be an issue in the live game after the patch goes out. This sucks for everyone involved, and it can lead to inaccurate patch notes, which we never want."</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies received the Citadelle des Morts map in Season 1, and while it's uncertain if another new map will arrive for Season 2, we do have story teasers that point to the next map being an excavation site in France. The setting and location sound very similar to the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2, which took place at Excavation Site 64 in Northern France.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Details for this next season of battle royale haven't been revealed yet, but in addition to anti-cheat improvements, Season 2 will likely include new modes, events, and game improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Verdansk map is set to return in the springtime, which an insider has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/verdansk-could-return-to-call-of-duty-warzone-in-season-3/1100-6528765/">leaked to potentially be the Season 3 update</a> for Warzone.</p>

                <p>Developer FuturLab has announced that it is ending support for PowerWash Simulator VR due to its dwindling financial viability. However, the studio has seemingly avoided layoffs since the VR team has been moved to other projects.</p><p>"We have been faced with a cross roads: we have a truly excellent and kind VR team who were working on a platform which costs us more than it makes, while also having a list of job openings that were looking to be filled on other projects," CEO Kristy Rigden explained in a statement.</p><p>She said that she prioritized job security for her team, so she filled those other roles and projects with members from the VR team.</p><p>Rigden also explained that while general VR support is currently winding down, that doesn't mean that the FuturLab won't support the platform in the future. The studio clarified that the VR game and currently released DLC are still purchasable and playable, but it will not receive any future updates.</p><p>The VR space has seen some challenges over the past few years.

                <p dir="ltr">The annual Awesome Games Done Quick accumulated another eye-popping sum to fight against cancer last week.

                <p>Starfield was originally planned to have a gore and dismemberment system like Fallout, with players being able to more gruesomely kill foes. However, these features were ultimately left out of Starfield.</p><p>In an interview with Kiwi Talkz, former senior character artist Dennis Mejillones said that there were technical considerations when it came to the space suits. "There's a lot that has to go with it. You have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off; you have meat caps to the bottom where the flesh is," he explained. "We had systems for all of that, and it turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you have to count for."</p><p>With the feature of being able to customize body size in the character creator, that added more complications. Mejillones also said that gore and dismemberment didn't fit with Starfield's themes as opposed to Fallout's over-the-top presentation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2697">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ebSmOGZnmeM?start=2697" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Fallout is very stylized in that regard. It's part of the tongue-in-cheek humor. You know that perk where you can make a mess out of something and blow up? It's part of the fun," he explained.</p><p>He added that Starfield was meant to be more realistic, so gore and dismemberment didn't fit in thematically. With the technical costs factored in, it was decided that gore would be scrapped from the game.</p><p>Other former Starfield developers have shared their thoughts on the game and the industry at large. One said that they were surprised at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-starfield-dev-surprised-by-the-number-of-loading-screens-it-could-have-existed-without-those/1100-6528530/" data-ref-id="1100-6528530">number of loading screens</a> Starfield had, and another Bethesda veteran said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-veteran-says-players-are-fatigued-by-seemingly-endless-games/1100-6528653/" data-ref-id="1100-6528653">players are fatigued by long games</a>.</p><p>Starfield is currently on PC and Xbox Series X|S. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-responds-to-ps5-rumors-for-starfield-gears-of-war/1100-6520838/" data-ref-id="1100-6520838">rumors that the game will come to PS5</a>, as Microsoft has already ported some of its other first-party titles to rival platforms, but nothing has been confirmed yet. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">Elder Scrolls VI</a> is also in the works, still with no release window since its announcement <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-elder-scrolls-6-just-reached-a-sad-milestone/1100-6528679/" data-ref-id="1100-6528679">almost seven years ago</a>.</p>
