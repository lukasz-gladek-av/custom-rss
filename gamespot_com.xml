                <p>Nintendo is bringing another beloved GameCube title to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service next week. The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luigis-mansion/" data-ref-id="5000-3596">Luigi's Mansion</a> is joining the classic games lineup on October 30.</p><p>Originally released alongside the GameCube in November 2001, Luigi's Mansion sees Mario's cowardly brother exploring a haunted mansion he won in a contest he never entered. With the help of Professor E. Gadd and his vacuum-like Poltergust 3000, Luigi must work his way through the mansion's many rooms and capture all the ghosts that lurk within.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvN4hHpfVqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvN4hHpfVqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Luigi's Mansion marks the sixth title to arrive on Switch Online's GameCube collection. The library launched alongside the Switch 2 with three games--The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur II--while Super Mario Strikers and Chibi-Robo were added to the lineup in July and August, respectively.</p><p>Nintendo will be bringing more GameCube games to the service in the future. The company has already confirmed that additional classics like Super Mario Sunshine, Pokemon Colosseum, and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance are on the way, although it hasn't yet announced when those games will be added.</p><p>The GameCube collection is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks available to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Members can also download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free.</p><p>An individual subscription for the base Nintendo Switch Online service runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/payday-2/" data-ref-id="5000-152296">Payday 2</a> may predate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/payday-3/" data-ref-id="5000-455016">Payday 3</a> by a decade, but the former still remains popular while the latter has struggled. Now, publisher Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates on PC and keep those players satisfied.</p><p>Sidetrack was previously known as the M.U.G. Team in the Payday modding community, and the studio also worked on updates for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/raid-world-war-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-462957">RAID: World War 2</a> after that game's lifecycle came to an end. According to <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday2/2025/10/next-chapter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze</a>, Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a focus "on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience." Future updates are planned for "quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes."</p><p>Starbreeze will host a livestream on October 23 that lays out the details of the patch and invites the player community to "help shape future improvements." With Payday 2 now in the hands of Sidetrack going forward, Starbreeze will primarily be working on updates for Payday 3. Payday 2 still has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has tens of thousands of players</a> at any given time, according to SteamDB. However, Payday 3 has trouble <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking 1,000 concurrent players</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-studio-cancels-dd-game-focusing-on-payday-and-new-heisting-games/1100-6535161/" data-ref-id="1100-6535161">canceled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> and laid off workers in a renewed push towards the Payday franchise and other heist games. The company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-2-launches-a-subscription-service-that-gets-you-lots-of-dlc-for-5-month/1100-6534993/" data-ref-id="1100-6534993">added a Payday 2 subscription service</a> that gives players access to the DLC for a monthly charge. Starbreeze went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starbreeze-apologizes-for-payday-2-dlc-price-increase/1100-6535030/" data-ref-id="1100-6535030">apologize for raising the Payday 2 DLC bundle</a> to $170 and subsequently reverted the price back to $118.</p>
