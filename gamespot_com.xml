                <p>One of the biggest talking points following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Direct</a> was how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> is priced at $80 USD. That's $10-$20 higher than most major AAA games, prompting people to voice their opinions about the price hike. Nintendo isn't charging $80 for all Switch 2 games, but why is it doing so for Mario Kart World?</p><p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-are-so-high-according-to-analysts-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Nintendo is doing this simply because they can, and any online "uproar" will blow over in time.</p><p>"I think they raised software prices across all these regions because they think they can," Toto said. "Nintendo already priced in the protest and uproar by part of the fan base, betting this will all blow off and gamers will come to accept a new normal eventually. And I think they will be correct about this."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="87831021" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

charging $700 for the PS5 Pro and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">rumors of GTA 6 costing $100.</a> Toto also mentioned how Nintendo "got away" with charging $70 for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom back in 2023, marking the company's first push to the $70 level.</p><p>If you're not convinced that Mario Kart World is worth $80, Nintendo says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">it will help demonstrate the value of the game during the April 17 Nintendo Direct. </a></p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said Nintendo looks at each game on a case-by-case basis when it comes to pricing, which is why Mario Kart World is $80 and some other Nintendo Switch 2 games might cost less.</p><p>"We'll look at varying prices and things like that for software based off of just how robust the experience is," Trinen said. "People will get to learn more about that game. And I think that as they start to learn more about that game, they're going to be pretty excited about the content that's offered there."</p><p>According to one retailer, video game prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">need to go up</a> to maintain the overall stability of the market.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, arriving alongside the system on June 5. Mario Kart World is included with the Switch 2 in a $500 bundle, though some believe <a href="https://ase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the price might go up due to tariffs.</a></p>

                <p>Nintendo's official unveiling of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2</a> coincided with President Trump unleashing higher tariffs on all imports, including consoles and games. In response, Nintendo took the extraordinary step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delaying Switch 2 preorders</a> amidst market uncertainty. However, one analyst believes that Nintendo won't increase Switch 2's $450 price before launching on June 5.</p><p>David Cole, the founder of the research firm DFC Intelligence, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he expects Nintendo to maintain the $450 price initially, and added "we believe that price point was reached with the threat of tariffs already looming." Cole also said that if the 24% tariffs on goods from Japan remain in place, Switch 2's price could rise 20% within the next two years. He went on to suggest that Nintendo may limit the amount of Switch 2 consoles available at launch in response to the tariffs. Tariffs are even higher on goods coming from China and Vietnam, where Nintendo is manufacturing the system.</p><p>"There may be a supply issue if Nintendo chooses to limit production initially," noted Cole. "Nintendo is very conservative and they don't like to take big risks on having surplus inventory. So they may take a bit of a wait-and-see approach given some of the current unknowns."</p><p>DFC's projection for Switch 2's launch numbers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-sell-fewer-systems-than-previously-thought-analyst-says/1100-6530681/" data-ref-id="1100-6530681">were also revised downward</a> from 17 million to 15 million in 2025. Regardless, Cole remains bullish on Switch 2's potential to grab "an even larger [market] share than the original Switch."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association has already warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/" data-ref-id="1100-6530636">the tariffs may severely harm the video game industry</a> beyond Nintendo. Other analysts have said that video game publishers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tariffs-may-lead-publishers-to-abandon-physical-games-says-analyst/1100-6529858/" data-ref-id="1100-6529858">may abandon physical releases altogether</a> in order to avoid the tariffs.</p>

"The controller is only compatible with Nintendo GameCube: Nintendo Classics," the fine print reads.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4473351-nintendo-fine-print.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473351" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4473351-nintendo-fine-print.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473351"></a><figcaption>Always read the fine print.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4473351-nintendo-fine-print.jpg"></figure><p>What makes this an odd omission is that the GameCube controller has almost every input necessary for the majority of modern games, even if the placement of buttons is a little bit unusual when compared to the standard arrangement on other current-day controllers. It is worth noting that it offers extra functionality compared to the original as well, as it includes features such as wireless connectivity and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/">Switch 2's brand-new C button</a> for live chat.</p><p>Before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo delayed preorders</a> for the Switch 2, it was confirmed that players would need to have an active Nintendo Switch Online membership to purchase the GameCube controller. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/" data-ref-id="2900-6400">The GameCube library</a> will be available through the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription service, and it'll launch with Wind Waker, Soulcalibur 2, and F-Zero GX. Other games like Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokemon Colosseum, and more will be added further down the line.</p><p>It's not clear when Switch 2 preorders will reopen, but analysts expect <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/">Nintendo will have to raise the price of the console</a> due to US president Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>

It appears it will indeed once again return, as an image that leaked from Nintendo Korea's website appears to tease Rainbow Road.</p><p>As spotted by<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Eurogamer</a>, the Nintendo Korea website for Mario Kart World posted--and swiftly removed--the image below.

                <p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> promotional image posted by Nintendo Korea may have accidentally revealed one of the game's major characters--a young girl who looks suspiciously similar to Pauline.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/nintendo-accidentally-leaks-an-unrevealed-donkey-kong-bananza-character-that-might-unironically-have-huge-lore-implications-for-the-mario-universe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the character's appearance in the Nintendo Korea box art has led to a flurry of speculation as fans try to decipher what role Pauline might play in the game, and whether her young appearance means Bananza is in fact a prequel.</p><p>For those less familiar with the extended Mario/Donkey Kong universe, Pauline is a side character who first appeared as the iconic damsel in distress in the 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game. While she disappeared from the games for some time after that, she reappeared as the mayor of New Donk City in Super Mario Odyssey, and has since become a regular character in Mario spin-off titles.</p><p>Now, it appears that she may be returning to the Donkey Kong series, according to a piece of cover art that was posted to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/kr/switch2/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Korea</a> website. The art shows what looks like a younger Pauline holding onto Donkey Kong's tie as he smashes his way through the ground.</p><p>The art has now been replaced on the Korean site with an image that swaps Pauline for the crystalline purple sidekick known as Odd Rock. This has only led to further speculation after eagle-eyed fans noted that Pauline, in the original image, was wearing a purple crystal bracelet that seems to resemble Odd Rock.</p><p>The appearance of Pauline as a young girl has led fans to question the game's place in the Donkey Kong timeline, with some suggesting that Bananza could be a prequel game starring the original Donkey Kong--the character we've known as Donkey Kong from Nintendo's recent games is the grandson of the original, though The Super Mario Bros. Movie refers to him as his son. </p><p>Other theories speculate that the mystery character is actually Pauline's daughter, that Odd Rock is taking on her appearance, or that she has been aged down by some kind of magic or device.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza will launch on July 17, when we'll find out for sure if the mystery girl is Pauline, and what role she'll be playing in the world of Donkey Kong.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-red-faction-gorilla/1100-6530581/" data-ref-id="1100-6530581">Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On: Red Faction Gorilla</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">Switch 2 Hands-On: More Of The Same, But It Can Still Surprise You</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World Hands-On: The Conservative Switch 2 Gets A Bold Sequel</a></li></ul>
