                <p>With Fortnite OG existing as its own permanent mode now, we aren't expecting another throwback mini-season in the vein of last year's Chapter 2 Remix or the original OG season the year before. But with the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 4 starting on August 8, we're pretty much guaranteed a new mini-season in November, because Fortnite has never had a four-month season on purpose before. Instead, the hot rumor since the beginning of May is that we'll be getting another collaboration mini-season like Star Wars season in May, this time with <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238" rel="nofollow ">The Simpsons taking center stage</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you consider Epic's cozy relationship with Disney, plus its long history of Fox Animation collabs--including three cartoon dads Fortnite dropped for Father's Day this past June--this rumor sounds pretty plausible. Indeed, there's been nearly no skepticism about it at all. November is still a long ways away, though, and a lot can happen between now and then. While we wait, let's see what exactly the rumor mill has said about this one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When would the Simpsons mini-season start?</h2><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1950226569697362395" rel="nofollow ">next season's update schedule</a>, Chapter 6 Season 4 should end on Saturday, November 1, which indicates it'll have a live finale event to wrap things up during the day. If things work the way they did after the Death Star Sabotage event in June, the new mini-season would begin that same evening after 4-7 hours of maintenance. Otherwise, it would start the next morning, on November 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is the Simpsons mini-season officially confirmed?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not at all. Every bit of info about the purported Simpsons season comes from leakers and dataminers, and it has all just been written descriptions--there's been no leaked art or anything tangible that might serve as some level of confirmation. There is, however, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1932068250143039720" rel="nofollow ">one poster in Utopia City</a> that could be hinting at a Simpsons collab, but that's not confirmation of any sort of takeover.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the way Epic typically likes to hold back on promoting a new season until the current one is almost over, we've got a while before Epic will say anything about it at all. But prominent leakers have been harping on it so regularly that a lot of folks have taken it as read that a Simpsons season is coming. But until some real teasers start popping up, November's Simpsons mini-season remains an unconfirmed rumor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What would a Simpsons mini-season entail?</h2><p dir="ltr">The rumors so far are vague and confusing, and so it's a little difficult to sift through it all right now. The full picture is not even remotely clear just yet. Keep that in mind as we lay out the fractured details that we currently have.</p><p dir="ltr">The most surprising detail among the rumors thus far is that the Simpsons will have an entire map modeled after the Simpsons' hometown of Springfield, but the claim is that it will be <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1931473086538531263" rel="nofollow ">the size of a Reload map and support only 40 players</a>. It's not out of the question that the main Battle Royale mode could go small for this since it only lasts a month--let's not forget that Epic made <em>everyone</em> play Zero Build for two weeks after it was introduced in early 2022. But there's also another fairly obvious possibility worth considering: that the Springfield map actually <em>will</em> be for Reload, rather than BR.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Reload is Fortnite's clear no. 2 mode at this point, and it has no battle pass, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic looked for new ways to encourage folks to play it. Plus, it just got a Squid Game-themed map added to its rotation in June, so there's precedent. On the other hand, this part of the rumor could be completely wrong. Blortzen, the leaker who first spread the rumor about the Simpsons season, suggested in June that the rumor about a small map was <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1934688153606004804" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actually about Blitz Royale</a>, which was announced a couple weeks after all these Simpsons rumors were spread around.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, everything else we've heard makes this rumored Simpsons season sounds like it will include most of the same stuff other mini-seasons have--a small battle pass, accompanying shop skins, and weekly changes to the map. But since we haven't heard any significant new details since the beginning of June, it's still hard to gauge what exactly Simpsons season will look like.</p>

                <p>Between 2021-2023, a former employee at one of game publisher Bandai Namco's subsidiaries allegedly "misappropriated" around 500 million yen (approximately $3.38 million USD), resulting in the employee's arrest and a temporary pay cut for many of the subsidiary's leadership, the company has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">While the arrest happened in January 2024 and Bandai Namco has since been pursuing civil and criminal charges against the former employee, the company is just now able to disclose the incident, according to a <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/HPE794A8_E_BLPHKE9968BE7A4BA.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> outlining the alleged misconduct and the steps Bandai Namco has taken to remedy the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The alleged embezzlement occurred at Bandai Namco's Hong Kong subsidiary Bandai Logipal and was discovered via an internal audit. Following the former employee's arrest, Bandai Logipal took disciplinary actions against many of its leadership in the form of a temporary pay deduction. Four officers and three full-time directors saw a 30% pay deduction for three months starting in April 2024, with two other full-time directors seeing a 15% pay deduction for the same period.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our group takes the occurrence of this incident very seriously and we sincerely and deeply apologize to all our stakeholders for their concerns and the inconvenience caused by such incident," Bandai Namco states. "We will continue our full cooperation with the local law enforcement authorities for the investigation, and we as a group shall work together to prevent the recurrence of such incidents."</p><p dir="ltr">In a step to prevent a similar incident in the future, the Japan-based Bandai Namco is forming a new department to supervise the management of overseas subsidiaries. It notes that the impact of the incident on Bandai Namco's fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 is expected to be minimal.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony recently announced it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">investing $463 million in Bandai Namco</a> as part of a "strategic partnership" that will see it own around 2.5% of the entertainment company. While both company's are well known for video games, in a joint statement, Bandai Namco and Sony said it will "focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Super Nintendo app already had a CRT filter, but this new version, added alongside the same update that added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/create-your-own-mario-masterpiece-with-mario-paint-now-on-nintendo-classics-online/1100-6533518/" data-ref-id="1100-6533518">Mario Paint to the service</a>, is a noticeable improvement. According to one user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mccg66/snes_classics_crt_filter_has_been_updated_on_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, it's an "NTSC S-Video" style filter that more accurately displays what playing on an actual CRT is like.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on social media have been posting comparison screenshots between the old and new filter, and the difference is definitely noticeable. One screenshot in particular, posted by a Bluesky user named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smashtoons.com/post/3lv4ytp7xgc2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dalton</a>, helps to highlight the difference, as you can clearly see the much more defined lines that help improve the image when compared to the old filter.
