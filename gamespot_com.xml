                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has once again commented on the company's strategy as it relates to launching its own first-party games on other platforms. As Spencer has been saying for a long time already, he believes Xbox is strongest and best-positioned when it launches its own games on other platforms. A game remaining exclusive to Xbox in perpetuity "doesn't work for us" going forward, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm if Bethesda's RPG Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console for the time being. Spencer said, "No."</p><p>He added: "There is no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say, 'This game will not go to a place where it will find players, where it would have business success for us.'"</p><p>Spencer said what his team has found is that launching Xbox games on other platforms amounts to "better business" results for the company, which in turn allows Microsoft to invest in the kinds of games that it recently showed off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">January Xbox Developer Direct.</a></p><p>"That's our strategy. Our strategy is to allow our games to be available [across consoles]. Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform. But to keep games off of other platforms, we don't think--that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us," he said.</p><p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. Because the world's biggest games are available in multiple places. More and more, creators are asking us, 'How do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places.' We want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that," Spencer added. "We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are 'single platform on single device.' Whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console. We want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p><p>Some Xbox fans have expressed concerns about this new strategy, and particularly how it may lead to a feeling of Microsoft losing its identity. Spencer said he's heard these concerns and takes them seriously. He said Xbox's "identity will continue to evolve," which he said has always been the case since the Xbox brand was launched in 2001.</p><p>The next big Xbox title to come to PS5 is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which hits Sony's console this spring following its debut on Xbox back in December. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will then launch in May across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at the same time. Starfield, meanwhile, launched in September 2023 and remains exclusive on console to Xbox (it's also available on PC). </p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be censored in Japan due to its depiction of gore and has received a mature rating from the country's video game rating system.</p><p>According to Ubisoft Japan (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-will-be-censored-in-japan-to-comply-with-cero/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), depictions of dismemberment have been completely removed from the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Other versions of the game will still have the ability to to toggle the dismemberment feature on or off.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has also been rated CERO Z by Japan's video game rating system, which is the equivalent of North America's ESRB rating of M. The Japanese version will have some modified voice lines as well, but Ubisoft Japan didn't provide any additional explanation or details.</p><p>This isn't the first time CERO stepped in regarding dismemberment in a video game. 2023's Dead Space remake was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-remakes-japanese-ban-confuses-ea-exec-after-stellar-blade-rating-released/1100-6522831/" data-ref-id="1100-6522831">banned in Japan</a> because of the game's depiction of severed body parts. However, its ban was later criticized after Stellar Blade's Japanese rating was revealed. The game depicted dismemberment, but it was still allowed to be sold in Japan.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows takes place in feudal Japan, which could explain why Ubisoft and the Japan video game ratings board are being extra careful with this release. Director Chris Benoit said that the reason behind the game's second delay was to polish the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/" data-ref-id="1100-6528995">parkour mechanics on feudal Japan's architecture</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>, we said, "Ubisoft Quebec seems poised to be the first to pull together Assassin's Creed's disparate eras, but we've been here before and it's routinely not worked out."</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said doubled down on Microsoft's commitment to the hardware space via Xbox, saying the company aims to "win" by providing the best experience out there. At the same time, Spencer admitted that times have changed. These days, it's a "game-first" market as opposed to "platform-first," he said.</p><p>Appearing on the GamerTag Radio podcast, Spencer said, "I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and how that fits into the choices they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the hardware capabilities that we have."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAl5yVpNc3o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer said the biggest, most-played, and most successful video games out there today are multiplatform games that are not locked to one device. Spencer said he's hopeful his teams can create a platform with Xbox that appeals to developers who make those kinds of games.</p><p>"I want to build a platform that services those creators: those creators that are trying to meet people on every screen," he said.</p><p>Spencer also pushed back against the ongoing claims and assertions that Microsoft should get out of the hardware business given its place as the No. 3 system out there today, behind PS5 and Switch.</p><p>"Our own hardware? I think it's fundamental to what Xbox is. It's not lost on me that, 'Box' is in the name of our brand. I'll say, in the position I'm in, I look at hardware as a critical part of what we do," he said.</p><p>Spencer said it's his mission, as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming, to "build innovative hardware" that he hopes will attract players. That could be a traditional console that plays on a TV, or a handheld device, or even in "other places" via Xbox, he said.</p><p>On the subject of the handheld market, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">ongoing rumors of Microsoft creating its own dedicated Xbox portable device</a>. Spencer didn't confirm anything, but said he's learned a lot from Steam Deck and ROG Ally, specifically. "What does Xbox mean on those platforms? I don't think we've tuned it perfectly yet," he said.</p><p>The video game hardware market in the US had a difficult 2024, with all three major platforms--PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch--seeing their yearly sales sink year-over-year. A downturn was expected due to the age of the systems, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">the falloff was greater than some experts envisioned</a>. The Xbox Series X|S platform is seeing particularly challenging results, as sales relative to the Xbox One are down as well, whereas <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-hardware-was-always-expected-to-struggle-in-2024-but-it-was-worse-than-one-analyst-expected/1100-6529003/" data-ref-id="1100-6529003">PS5 sales are up over PS4 over a similar period of time.</a></p>
