"If we were actively working towards bringing WoW to consoles, or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying, 'We're actively working towards it, we know we have a lot of work to do but it's a place where we want to land.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Hazzikostas said the team's focus is still on PC and that major changes coming in Midnight to class ability rotations, more readable endgame encounters, and built-in tools that don't require players download add-ons are about "approachability."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KDhK0_vuoJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rumors about WoW coming to consoles have only heated up in recent years following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard in 2023</a>. More recently, WoW's upcoming changes, as well as a recent report that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-might-ditch-multiplayer-paywall-report/1100-6535732/" data-ref-id="1100-6535732">next Xbox will essentially be a PC</a> that allow players to launch Windows and apps like Battle.net, have led some to believe even more strongly that WoW will be coming to consoles sooner rather than later. Even former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra added to the rumor mill in a <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/mmo/former-microsoft-and-blizzard-exec-says-new-xbox-consoles-are-just-pcs-and-that-might-be-why-world-of-warcraft-is-killing-addons/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">since-deleted post on X</a>, stating "Maybe this is why they are killing add-ons. Casual WoW inc."</p><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard might not be actively working on bringing WoW to consoles, the changes coming in Midnight won't hurt if a console version was to eventually become a priority for the developer. PC MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy XIV</a> have found success on console, so there is certainly potential for WoW to make the jump, should Blizzard ever decide to make it happen.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW news, recent datamines have revealed Blizzard may be introducing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-looks-to-be-getting-a-new-premium-currency-for-housing/1100-6535888/" data-ref-id="1100-6535888">premium currency for its upcoming player housing system</a>, as well as the return of the game's most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/" data-ref-id="1100-6535911">infamous (and expensive) shop mount</a>, the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: Midnight does not yet have an official release date, but is expected to arrive early next year, mostly likely in February if a datamined date for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-datamine-reveals-when-player-housing-will-likely-arrive-in-full/1100-6535796/" data-ref-id="1100-6535796">expansion's pre-patch</a> is to be believed.</p>

                <p>We're just a few months shy of Valve's Steam Deck turning four years old, but the Steam owner doesn't look like it's going to wind down support any time soon. In fact, it might be listening to feedback more than ever, as one of the most requested features for the handheld gaming PC is finally being added soon.</p><p>One of the weirdest quirks with the Steam Deck is the requirement to have the handheld's display on to download games. You weren't able to put the PC into sleep mode to conserve battery while downloading a new game, which is especially irritating for large downloads and those using the burn-in prone Steam Deck OLED. Valve seemingly has finally acknowledged that this is silly, and has introduced the ability to download games in a new power-saving mode in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/771930569635267984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Steam Deck update</a>.</p>

      </div>
<p>Available in preview before going live to all Steam Deck users, the new mode is automatically enabled when you plug your handheld into power. While a game is downloading, the screen will automatically turn off and continue in the background, with a new information screen showing progress being displayed if you move the handheld briefly or press a button.</p><p>The same mode can be enabled in the settings menu for when the Steam Deck is running off its battery, with Valve optimistic that this low-power mode will conserve as much as possible. If the battery depletes to 20%, the Steam Deck will automatically go into sleep mode and pause any active downloads.</p><p>Valve has remained coy on a successor to the Steam Deck despite its age, with reports suggesting that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-2-release-is-over-two-years-away-according-to-new-rumor/1100-6534362/" data-ref-id="1100-6534362">new, upgraded model might only arrive in 2027</a>. In the meantime, ASUS and Microsoft have recently launched the ROG Xbox Ally X with AMD's new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip that offers improved performance over most other handheld gaming PC's on the market, albeit with some compromises.

Even so, it's evident that those who recently got a Switch 1 aren't as eager to upgrade compared to early Switch 1 adopters.</p><p>The earnings report included numerous insights into Nintendo's strategy going forward--the company is unsurprisingly shifting its "primary development focus" to Nintendo Switch 2, and it plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">maintain a steady pace of movie releases</a> based on the company's properties.</p><p>Still, Nintendo has some notable Switch 1 titles coming up, including Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream. It certainly helps those transitioning between hardware that almost all Switch 1 games are playable on Switch 2, with Nintendo acknowledging in its report that given the "widespread adoption of Nintendo Switch software, [the company is] seeing that many of these titles are also being played on the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware." </p><p>According to Nintendo, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">sold over 10 million Switch 2 units</a> as of the end of September. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/#13" data-ref-id="2900-5124">sales for the Switch 1 are creeping closer</a> to those of the Nintendo DS, the latter of which is the company's best-selling hardware ever--at least, for now.</p>
