                <p>The last couple of years have seen several well-received Godzilla movies released, and parent company Toho is looking to grow that success beyond the silver screen. The Japanese studio has announced that it will invest $830 million in new games, anime, and other projects based on its IP, including Godzilla console games.</p><p>Toho plans to spend $490 million on content development alone, which will focus on a broad range of media as it pivots toward growing its brand overseas (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/-godzilla-studio-toho-to-invest-830-million-in-global-push" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>). In addition to an undefined number of Godzilla console games, the studio will also focus on animation, theme park attractions, and mobile games as part of its brand expansion strategy.</p><p>While Godzilla appeared in numerous video games over the decades, the last couple of years have seen the kaiju king relegated to crossovers and cameos. Games like Fall Guys have offered Godzilla cosmetics to players, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> featured Godzilla as an environmental hazard and enemy as part of its Operation Monarch event.</p><p>Recently, Godzilla has starred in several mobile games--and a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Into the Breach in 2022 called Godzilla: Voxel Wars--but the last big game featuring the titan was 2014's Godzilla for the PS4, which was later released in Europe and the US in 2015. That game was met with negative reception upon release, and it has an average critic score of 38 on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/godzilla/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><p>"Godzilla commits so many game design sins that they become impossible to count, but the greatest horror of them all is that such giant monsters could be so boring," Kevin VanOrd wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/godzilla-review/1900-6416191/">Godzilla review</a>, scoring the game 3/10.</p><p>While it'll be a long time before Godzilla stomps his way back onto consoles, the cinematic future of the King of the Monsters looks bright. As mentioned above, a sequel to the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One is in development, and Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse will see the Godzilla and King Kong franchises team up for a third time in a movie that is scheduled to be released on March 26, 2027.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has been rolling out its RTX 50-Series graphics cards over the past few months, and today marks the arrival of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti. <strong>Available in 8GB ($379) and 16GB ($429) formats</strong>, early reviews are calling it a solid addition to the Nvidia catalog and worth considering if you’re seeking a versatile mid-range card. Unsurprisingly, the new RTX 5060 Ti is a hot commodity, with retailers already selling out, though new stock is likely to return soon. To help track availability, we’ve put together a short list of major retailers most likely to have the RTX 5060 Ti in stock.

The end result is faster performance than its predecessor and the ability to upscale lower resolutions to 1440p and 4K resolutions. According to Nvidia, the RTX 5060 Ti offers double the performance of the old RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 4 is enabled (it's worth noting that the RTX 5060 Ti's performance uplift over the 4060 Ti <em>without</em> DLSS 4 is closer to about 15% faster). You’ll find the GPUs to be much slimmer than the RTX 4060 lineup, too, thanks to AI technology that allows the hardware to hit better benchmarks without requiring the same raw horsepower.</p><p>A variety of 5060 Ti models (including overclocked variants) are available from third parties. Here’s a look at some of the top models offered at Best Buy.</p><h2>Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti Models</h2><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/0v4cioz0vf7pb?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448207168277?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (8GB)</a> -- $420</li><li><a href="https://howl.link/1bkjrcgreysjq?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448208821128?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (16GB)</a> -- $480</li><li><a href="https://howl.link/ze2618ytf2kw5?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448208335473?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC Edition (8GB)</a> -- $470</li><li><a href="https://howl.link/pjcdsxf0xjjig?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448209025451?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus Prime Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC Edition (16GB)</a> -- $530</li><li><a href="https://howl.link/jws7xgptdxo2i?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448208625398?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF Gaming Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC Edition (8GB)</a> -- $540</li><li><a href="https://howl.link/hqbywlmpewgoz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17448209223396?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus TUF Gaming Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Ti OC Edition (16GB)</a> -- $600</li></ul><hr><p>It's worth noting that the standard GeForce RTX 5060 is expected to arrive next month for $299, and you’ll also find RTX 5060 laptops in May, with prices starting at $1,099.

                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>
