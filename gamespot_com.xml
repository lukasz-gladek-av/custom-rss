                <p>A new report on Monolith's Wonder Woman video game has emerged, claiming that the project has undergone a reboot behind the scenes and has so far cost Warner Bros. over $100 million. It's claimed that the Wonder Woman game is still years away from being released.</p><p>"A video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project,"<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Bloomberg's Jason Schreier wrote</a>. "Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to

procedural storytelling in its design. Warner Bros. executives reportedly weren't interested in this proposal, and three years later, the project was canceled. The executives suggested that Monolith should instead work on one of the company's franchises, and after the departure of studio head Kevin Stephens and several key creatives--who would go on to form a new studio at EA to work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">Black Panther game</a>--the rest of Monolith began development on the Wonder Woman game.</p><p>Schrier's report says that an early version of the game attempted to reimagine the Nemesis system from the Mordor games, allowing Wonder Woman to befriend her enemies. This idea was eventually scrapped "in favor of a more traditional action-adventure game" and the future of the project might be in jeopardy.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-teased-during-the-game-awards-from-monolith/1100-6498851/">The Game Awards in 2021</a>, but since then, the studio has kept quiet on development aside from confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-isnt-live-service-despite-recent-job-listing/1100-6519317/">it will not be a live-service title</a>. Reports of a troubled development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-reportedly-having-troubled-development/1100-6523971/">first began cropping up last year</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend at Warner Bros. Games, as recent projects have failed to take off. Rocksteady's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301"> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a $200 million flop</a> for the company, Warner Bros. Montreal's Gotham Knights saw lukewarm sales when it launched, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus will shut down in May</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two has supported Nintendo platforms over the years, and the company expects that to continue with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. This comes just days after another high-profile publisher, EA, said something similar, indicating the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/" data-ref-id="1100-6529253">Madden series may show up on Switch 2.</a></p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/take-two-earnings-stock-price-0c8df088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Barron's</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he's not ready to make any announcements, but fans can expect reveals to come. "Historically, we've supported Nintendo platforms selectively; we've supported them when the platform is right for the property at hand," Zelnick said. "We haven't made any announcements, but I think you can expect it will be supportive when it makes sense."</p><p>During an earnings call, Zenick said there was a time when Nintendo platforms were aimed nearly exclusively at kids and young people in general, but that's no longer the case. The Switch can "support any audience" today, Zelnick said, stopping short of specifically confirming any game releases for Switch 2.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/take-two-ceo-bullish-on-his-games-but-wary-on-tariffs-strauss-zelnick/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Zelnick said, "I would have every belief that we'll be supportive of Switch 2."</p><p>People might want to know if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI </a>will show up on Switch 2, and there is no reason to believe it will. The game has only been announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive/" data-ref-id="5000-539473">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> came to Switch in 2021. Before that, Rockstar released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-chinatown-wars/" data-ref-id="5000-38075">GTA: Chinatown Wars</a> on Nintendo DS back in 2009.</p><p>Outside of Rockstar Games, there are plenty of 2K Games franchises that could potentially show up on Switch 2, but no announcements have been made. Recently, developers at Civilization studio Firaxis commented on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/" data-ref-id="1100-6529219">Switch 2's rumored mouse controls and how that could be "intriguing" for the series.</a></p><p>In other Take-Two news, the company has re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">GTA VI remains on schedule to launch in Fall 2025</a>, despite fears it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">could be delayed like many of Rockstar's past games were.</a></p>

                <p>Ahead of its full release on February 11, Civilization VII developer Firaxis has outlined plans to improve the game with post-launch fixes and new features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-early-reviews-suggest-a-divisive-experience/1100-6529191/" data-ref-id="1100-6529191">Early reviews for Civilization VII have been mixed so far</a>, while Steam community feedback posts have also highlighted several areas that need to be addressed.</p><p>In a developer update, Firaxis revealed that its primary focus is on the user interface, as it wants to make this part of the game easier to use and read. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," Firaxis explained in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>. "We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can."</p><p>Firaxis will also be working on implementing several features requested by the community, adding these in via free future updates. While the timing for these has yet to be worked out, the developer says that Civilization VII fans can expect to see the following features added in time:</p><ul><li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so that you can play cooperatively</li><li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to the Distant Lands system</li><li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single- or double-Age games</li><li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li><li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li><li>Hotseat multiplayer</li></ul><p>The studio added that is aiming to release Patch 1.1.0 in March, which includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, and additional bug fixes. Currently available in early access on PC, Civilization VII will also be coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><p>The game is also expected to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 via backwards compatibility</a>, and with rumors of the updated Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like functionality, Civilization VII executive producer Dennis Shirk recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/">commented that such a feature is quite intriguing</a>.</p>

                <p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that Football Manager 25 is canceled and will the developer will instead focus on their next release.</p><p>The developer provided a lengthy explanation as to why Football Manager 25 was canceled. While many of the game's areas hit the developer's internal targets, the overarching player experience and interface weren't up to standard. Through evaluations and playtesting, the development team was confident in a new direction, but the desired standards were ultimately still too far away. However, the team will take their learnings onto the next project.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sports Interactive regret to inform that, following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25. <a href="https://t.co/tLRbq8305K" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tLRbq8305K</a></p>  — Football Manager (@FootballManager) <a href="https://twitter.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," Sports Interactive and Sega said in a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>Football Manager 25 was already delayed twice from its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/football-manager-25-delayed-cutting-some-features/1100-6526298/" data-ref-id="1100-6526298">early November 2024 release to later that month</a>, then again to <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 2025</a>. The developer considered delaying the game further and fixing it down the line via patches, but decided against that. Additionally, anything past a March release would've been too late into the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the same year, presumably Football Manager 26.</p><p>Those who've preordered the game are eligible for automatic refunds, which are expected to take place soon.</p><p>Football Manager 24 will also not receive an update with 2024/2025 data as that would take away development resources from the studio's next game.</p><p>Football Manager 25 isn't the only game to get canceled so far this year. The Celeste dev's next game, Earthblade, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/celeste-devs-next-project-earthblade-officially-canceled/1100-6528966/" data-ref-id="1100-6528966">was canceled last month</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Sony has canceled two live-service projects</a>.</p>

                <p>Smite 2 Developer Hi-Rez has apparently laid off <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eazBFw1skA4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50-60 employees</a> and stopped development on three games: Rogue Company, Paladins, and Smite 1.</p><p>Several now-former employees of Hi-Rez took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media saying that they had been laid off</a>, and the layoffs look like they impact a variety of departments from designers, QA, marketing, and social media.</p><p>A Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/Hocky2001/status/1887567843576660451" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a message</a> presumably from Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam that stated that the reduction impacted the Rally Here, Evil Mojo, and Titan Forge Games divisions. Additionally, Rogue Company, Paladins, and Smite 1 will no longer receive major updates, but the servers will remain up for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Smite 2 is currently in early access, and looks to be Hi-Rez's sole focus going forward. The aforementioned message also stated that the reductions are meant to enable a steady flow of new content for Smite 2.</p><p>Hi-Rez already went through a round of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/brutal-game-layoffs-continue-with-smite-developer-hi-rez/1100-6526876/" data-ref-id="1100-6526876">layoffs back in October</a>.
