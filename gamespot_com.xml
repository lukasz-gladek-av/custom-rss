                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is the newest entry in Konami's long-running survival horror franchise, tasking players with navigating the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan as they attempt to uncover the mystery of a creeping fog that has produced bloodthirsty monsters around every corner. With this change in setting, Silent Hill f manages to be a great onboarding spot for series newcomers while maintaining plenty of familiar themes long-time players will recognize. But whether you're new to Silent Hill or a returning fan, you'll probably want to know how much playtime you can get out of this horrifying adventure. So, here's how long it takes to beat Silent Hill f.</p><h2>How long is Silent Hill f - Campaign length and replayability</h2><p>An average playthrough of Silent Hill f should take <strong>between 12-14 hours on Hard (normal) difficulty</strong>. This includes time spent solving puzzles and exploring at least some of the game's optional paths for additional healing items, upgrade materials, and weapons. However, those looking to advance through the campaign with less resistance can use the Story (easy) difficulty to reduce the combat and puzzle challenges, potentially allowing for a quicker completion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill f - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f is a game designed to be played multiple times, though. While you can beat the game just once if you wish, additional playthroughs--which let you carry over your health, stamina, and sanity upgrades--unravel even more story content. Not only do subsequent runs provide fresh cutscenes and boss changes, but they also provide the opportunity to see up to 5 total endings, revealing more and more of the unsettling story surrounding main character Shimizu Hinako.</p><p>Additionally, completionists will find that there are quite a few reasons to keep playing the campaign through multiple times, as getting every trophy or achievement won't be possible in a single playthrough. You'll need to continue into NG+ to keep earning consumable currency known as Faith so that you're able to purchase all the upgrades and omamori (accessories). And any one-off trophies or achievements you missed your first time or two through can always be tried again on a new run.</p><p>With so much replayability, Silent Hill f can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to survival horror enthusiasts. If that sounds like something you're eager to dive into yourself, you can pick up Silent Hill f now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

<p>Instead, Ogg said he prefers books. He encouraged people to read Crime and Punishment from Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky.</p><p>"Someone said, 'At some point, you should play GTA 5.' I said, 'Why?' They said, 'Because it's so great.' And I said, 'Well, one day you should read Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.' And then he went completely blank. Books are my thing," he said.</p><p>Ogg has previously discussed his inability to play video games, saying at one point he tried, but kept failing to progress and just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/tYo-zfFngfI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kept ramming into a wall with his character.</a></p><p>Ogg was said to have<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891"> recorded lines for a James Bond-like story DLC for GTA 5</a> that would have seen Trevor going undercover. However, that add-on obviously never happened, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">it was reportedly scrapped because of the success of GTA Online</a>. He's also said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">hopes Trevor shows up in GTA 6 so the character can be killed off.</a></p><p>Ogg is best known in gaming for GTA 5, but he's also known for playing Simon in more than 20 episodes of The Walking Dead. He also had a recurring role in the Snowpiercer TV series and was in a pair of Better Call Saul episodes as well. Ogg is also known for his <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/steven-ogg-old-spice-commercials-indie-films-1235116757/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">series of absurd Old Spice commercials.</a></p><p>The actor had roles in the video games Alone in the Dark (2008) and Cursed Mountain (2009) prior to his breakout success as Trevor in 2013's GTA 5. He hasn't done another video game since, however.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game stars Jason and Lucia, but Rockstar has not yet announced the actors playing those lead roles. Check out the gallery below to learn more about Jason, Lucia, and all the other main characters in GTA 6's story.</p>

                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>
