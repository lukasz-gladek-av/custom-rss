                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has released its mid-season update for Season 1.5, and while it's a small update, it still packs a fiery punch, focusing on tweaks to The Human Torch, Iron Man, and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p><p dir="ltr">"Following the balance adjustments in Season 1.5 and the addition of the Human Torch and The Thing, we've noticed a surge in the popularity of various heroes, leading to exciting new strategies in matches," the game's developers wrote in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post announcing the update</a>. "Whether it's a rush comp centered around mobile Vanguards and Duelists, a double-flyer setup featuring Storm and Human Torch, or the classic 3-1-2 lineup with three Vanguards, or even the previously popular 2-2-2 or single Vanguard compositions, each has showcased their unique flair in the current competitive environment."</p><p dir="ltr">"So, in this mid-season balance update for Season 1.5, we'll be optimizing the experience for just a handful of heroes to maintain this rich diversity," the post went on to explain. "As we gear up for Season 2, expect new Heroes and fresh Team-Up Abilities to bring an even more thrilling experience!"</p><p dir="ltr">So which heroes are getting tweaked this time around? First up is The Human Torch, who is getting buffs to his primary attack and his ultimate ability. His Fire Cluster projectiles now move 150 meters per second (up from 120), and 14 projectiles are fired (up from the previous 12). The energy cost of his Supernova ultimate ability has been upped from 3,400 to 4,000, but its activation wave damage has increased from 70 to 80, and his Flame Tornado now does 120 damage per second (up from 100).</p><p dir="ltr">Next up is Iron Man, who is getting some slight nerfs for balance. Direct hits from his Repulsor Blast (Stage 1 and Stage 2) now do 40 damage (down from 55), but his spell field damage has increased from 35 to 50. Direct hits from a Stage 3 Repulsor Blast now do 50 damage (down from 65), and spell field damage has been increased from 40 to 60.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Cloak &amp; Dagger are getting some attention in this update: The Duality Duo's Lightfore Dagger now heals 16 damage (up from 10) when hitting allies, but the spell field healing amount generated by the hit has decreased from 18 to 16.</p><p>For a closer look at the mid-season update, check out <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">the latest Marvel Rivals blog post</a>.</p>

Any chest or loot source has a chance to obtain a version of Mirror Imago, but one of the easiest ways to guarantee a drop of it is by using the Tome of Want. The Tome's scripture slots can be set to guarantee a drop of Mirror Imago using the first and second slots by selecting the appropriate Scriptures in their respective slots.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_God_Rolls">Mirror Imago God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458567" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458567"></a><figcaption>The new Mirror Imago submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4458567-3234363830.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_PvE_God_Roll">Mirror Imago PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel:</strong> Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Stability / +5 Handling / +5 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine:</strong> Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk:</strong> Subsistence  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating targets partially reloads the magazine from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk:</strong> Sword Logic  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows with this weapon grant bonus damage.

Because this is an adaptive-frame-type weapon, its rate of fire means it's easy to clear a room of smaller enemies. As the damage stacks up from Sword Logic, the weapon only gets stronger so long as bigger enemies keep being downed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Mirror_Imago_PvP_God_Roll">Mirror Imago PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel:</strong> Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">+7 Range / +7 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine:</strong> Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+1 Magazine / +10 Reload Speed / +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk:</strong> Pugilist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows with this weapon generate melee energy.

Because Guardian kills count as the strongest type of target, the buff from Sword Logic will always remain at the highest damage possible rather than building up to that point.</p><hr><p>Don't forget to also check out or guides on the new sidearm <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/" data-ref-id="1100-6530084">Lotus Eater</a> and how players can find bonus loot in the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-beat-destiny-2-court-of-blades-and-earn-bonus-loot/1100-6530061/" data-ref-id="1100-6530061">Court of Blades</a> activity in Destiny 2.</p>

This Legendary Arc trace rifle is far more effective in PvE than PvP activities due to the perks it can roll with.

Doing the Rushdown mode is the most effective way to get your hands on Keraunios quickly, as if you defeat at least three bosses in a single run, you're guaranteed a Guardian Games weapon drop. Keraunios is exclusive to Guardian Games, so remember that once the event is over, you will no longer be able to obtain it. At least, not until 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">Guardian Games event challenges also include a guaranteed Keraunios drop. All you need to do is earn and deposit any medal from the games in the Tower event area. Completing the first step in the Best in Class quest, collected from Eva Levante, will also give you a Keraunios. Remember that you need to equip or use the Guardian Games class item as an ornament for rewards to drop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458412"></a><figcaption>Keraunios</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4458412-destiny-2-keraunios.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_god_rolls_"><span>Keraunios god rolls</span></h3><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvE_god_roll">Keraunios PvE god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Fluted Barrel  <ul><li dir="ltr">Stability +5, Handling +15</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Light Battery  <ul><li dir="ltr">Handling +10, Reload Speed +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Recycled Energy or Eddy Current  <ul><li dir="ltr">Recycled Energy: Reloading after defeating targets grants energy to your lowest charged ability.</li><li dir="ltr">Eddy Current: Temporarily increases reload speed and handling after sprinting or while Amplified.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Jolting Feedback, Detonator Beam, or Rolling Storm  <ul><li dir="ltr">Jolting Feedback: Dealing repeated damage applies Jolt.

As standard, it fires accurate bursts of Arc energy at enemies, but with the right roll it turns into a lethal laser gun. Adding secondary effects, such as Jolt, increases the amount of outgoing damage as well as having the ability to disrupt enemy attacks. While we've opted to improve the handling of the weapon, you can also Masterwork its reload speed to complement the Light Battery, and we'd recommend this option first if you chose Eddy Current over Recycled Energy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458414"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4458414-destiny-2-keraunios%281%29.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Keraunios_PvP_god_roll">Keraunios PvP god roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Barrel: Smallbore  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +7, Stability +7</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Battery: Projection Fuse  <ul><li dir="ltr">Range +10</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">First Perk: Dynamic Sway Reduction  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves accuracy and stability while continuously holding down the trigger.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Second Perk: Closing Time  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improves range, accuracy, and handling as the magazine gets lower.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Masterwork: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">From our selections above, it might seem obvious that we're aiming for a huge increase on the Keraunios' average range. In a fast-paced PvP environment, it's not the strongest weapon you can take to the Crucible. It's still impressive and has the potential to put up a fight against the most formidable Guardians. Closing Time is great for boosting stats that will help you win in close fights, including range, although the magazine needs to be half-empty in order for it to trigger, so don't get too enthusiastic with your manual reloading.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for other new guns, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lotus-eater-god-roll-guide/1100-6530084/">Lotus Eater sidearm god rolls</a>.

                <p>The new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-window-cast-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far/2900-4679/" data-ref-id="2900-4679">The Last of Us Season 2</a> that debuted at SXSW recently has been a huge hit. According to Warner Bros. Discovery, the trailer has reached 158 million views across all platforms over its first three days. That's a record for any original HBO/Max programming, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/the-last-of-us-season-2-trailer-viewership-record-hbo-1236324465/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported</a>. The network did not reveal, however, what the previous biggest trailer was.</p><p>WBD said the new trailer is pacing ahead of previous trailers and teasers by at least 160%. The newest trailer was perhaps the best one yet, showing off the growing rift between Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey). The trailer also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-brings-back-spores-for-a-dramatic-reason/1100-6530032/" data-ref-id="1100-6530032">spores are back</a> and showed The Matrix actor Joe Pantoliano's character, Eugene, for the first time. Check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kaitlyn Dever joins the cast as Abby in Season 2. Young Mazino plays Jesse, Isabela Merced portrays Dina, and Catherine O'Hara appears as Joel's therapist. Additionally, Jeffrey Wright stars in Season 2 as Isaac, the character he played in The Last of Us: Part II.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 2 premieres Sunday, April 13, on HBO/Max. There will be seven episodes in all for Season 2, down from nine for Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-series-may-end-after-four-seasons-says-hbo-boss/1100-6529478/" data-ref-id="1100-6529478">At least two more seasons</a> are expected to follow.</p><p>Season 2 is expected to elicit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-writer-expecting-furor-over-season-2/1100-6515962/" data-ref-id="1100-6515962">"furor"</a> over some of the choices and changes the creative team made. But showrunner Craig Mazin isn't bothered. "We don't operate to either make people happy on social media or avoid making them upset. We just do what we think is right, and we hope that people come along for the ride and enjoy it," he said.</p><p>The Last of Us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-bet-on-there-being-a-last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6529927/" data-ref-id="1100-6529927">may never get a third installment in the game series</a>, but the franchise's next gaming release is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/" data-ref-id="1100-6528451">PC launch of The Last of Us 2 Remastered in April</a>.</p>
