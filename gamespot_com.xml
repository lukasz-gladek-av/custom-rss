                <p>It's officially 115 Day for Zombies fans, with January 15 being the yearly celebration of Call of Duty's Zombies mode. For this year's festivities, Treyarch has revealed the details for the next Zombies map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, and double XP is now live to celebrate 115 Day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's new Zombies map is called The Tomb, which will launch with the start of Season 2 on January 28. This map's narrative follows the events of the Citadelle des Morts main quest, with the characters headed to an excavation site in search of the Sentinel Artifact. A first look at the map can be seen in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245"></a><figcaption>The Tomb DLC map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says The Tomb was designed to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. The developer also teases one of the season's new weapons by saying, "What if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?" This could be hinting at the return of the MP-40 or PPSh-41 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate 115 Day, a quad feed of double XP is available in Black Ops 6 from now until January 21. This includes the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2X GobbleGum earn rate</li><li dir="ltr">2X Player XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Weapon XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Battle Pass XP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch included a preview of the quality-of-life upgrades planned for the Season 2 update. This includes a challenge-tracking feature similar to the one available in Modern Warfare 3, letting players track up to 10 challenges for camos and calling cards.</p><p dir="ltr">A new co-op pause feature is being added with Season 2. Currently, the pause feature is only available in solo games, but the update will include the option to pause when playing with friends. This feature requires all players to be in the same party, and the party leader will have the ability to pause the match for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have the ability to choose a separate HUD preset for Zombies and multiplayer, so they no longer need to switch HUDs between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on The Tomb will arrive closer to the season's launch, but here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything we know so far about Season 2</a>, including the much-anticipated updates for the Ricochet anti-cheat.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/15/xbox-repair-reduce-waste-energy-saving/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> new options for support to repair your Xbox console. The first, for in-person repairs, will begin on January 20 with uBreakiFix by Asurion becoming an Xbox Authorized Service Provider at nearly 700 store locations across the US The second involves the Microsoft Store, with replacement components becoming available to purchase online as of today.</p><p>According to the blog post, these options include the Xbox Series S - 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition. Microsoft advises reaching out to your nearest <a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uBreakiFix</a> by Asurion location and confirming participation in the program.</p><p>If you prefer to order parts online, the components are available via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's online store</a>, as well as the Microsoft Repair Hub on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iFixit</a>. Previously, the replacement components available for purchase were limited to controller parts.</p><p>In the blog post, Microsoft also details a correlation between these new repair options and the company's goal to become a "zero waste, carbon-negative, and water-positive company by 2030." In the meantime, it's aiming to eliminate single-use plastics from its packaging by 2025--hence why the Xbox Series X|S packaging is paper- and fiber-based.</p><p>Said goal has also had a smaller impact on the consoles themselves. According to Microsoft, it has improved how the Xbox Series S handles video, with average reduction approaching 10% in power consumption. The company also recommends using the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which can be found via Settings, General, and Power Options on your console.</p><p>The shutdown option has been available since September of last year, its addition paired alongside the announcement that the company's green initiatives have saved over 3 billion car miles of CO2 emissions. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-green-initiatives-for-xbox-have-saved-over-3bn-car-miles-of-co2-emissions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push for AI technology</a>, however, is undermining said efforts. "We fundamentally believe that the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly," Microsoft president Brad Smith told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-15/microsoft-s-ai-investment-imperils-climate-goal-as-emissions-jump-30?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "I guarantee there's one way to fail: It's to give up."</p>

PlayStation 5 players can snag the Scarlet Spider skin for free.
