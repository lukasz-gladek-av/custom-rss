                <p dir="ltr">Deciding which of <strong>The First Berserker Khazan's weapons</strong> to pick is more important than you might think at first glance. Any weapon technically works. However, the game doesn't hand out skill points quickly--nor do they carry over between weapon skill trees. Our First Berserker Khazan weapons guide explains which ones are worth your time and why.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Dual_Wield">Dual Wield</h2><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield is what you start Khazan with, and this weapon type is much more than just the standard hack-and-slash device it resembles at first glance. Once you start investing skill points in the Ruthless tree, you unlock some exceptionally useful abilities. Frenzy and the Breeze skills let you string together dash attacks to perform a series of slashes that only stops when you stop pressing the attack input. It overwhelms standard enemies and smaller guardians, and it can take a chunk out of a boss enemy as well, or at least their stamina meter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007"></a><figcaption>Dual Wield is your starting weapon, but that doesn't make it bad.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield also has some excellent upgrades for your basic attack, including one that lets you create chain combos with different effects depending on when you press certain inputs. There's one that flings you into the air and has you crash onto an enemy's head, though attacks with faster, more fluid animations tend to be safer and more effective in this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Potent Blow tree is a bit underwhelming compared to the spear's, but the Penetrate tree--oddly named, since it's tied to evasion skills--rewards you for successful dodges by powering up your basic attacks and the chains you build with them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Greatswords">Greatswords</h2><p dir="ltr">Greatswords are a bit awkward in Khazan. They hit hard and can easily take down standard enemies with one blow, but they're also very slow. Slowness isn't what you want when you're surrounded by enemies or struggling to find an opening against a speedy boss. However, the payoff comes as much from taking a large chunk out of a guardian's HP bar as it does from quickly reducing their stamina.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009"></a><figcaption>The Greatsword is powerful, but slow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Greatsword takes more practice to use effectively than the other two weapons, in other words, but many of its skills are also more underwhelming. You can charge the sword to deal more damage, block while charging strong attacks, and deal more damage if you take damage while you attack. That's all fine enough, but unlocking Greatsword skills feels more like mitigating the weapon's issues and not giving yourself new ways to use it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spears">Spears</h2><p dir="ltr">The spear is a versatile weapon that combines the best parts of Dual Wield and Greatswords. You get longer reach like with the Greatsword, along with Dual Wield's faster movement, plus the ability to catch multiple enemies with your attacks and some flashy, fun combos as well. Spear skill categories have a lot going on. The swift attack branch creates duplicates of Khazan that attack immediately after he does, essentially doubling your damage, while the strong attack branch channels some fighting game energy by encouraging you to chain different combos and inputs to end up with a few unique finishing moves.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these are designed to overwhelm enemies and keep them from attacking, while also pushing them back. It's useful for crowd control and, in areas with cliffs and ledges, for shoving foes to their doom without having to actually fight them. That doesn't work on boss guardians, though.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010"></a><figcaption>Fast and flashy, the spear is an excellent choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Further down the skill tree, the spear lets you learn attacks that change depending on whether you've broken an enemy's stance, for example, dealing additional damage or instantly repositioning you behind them. While it takes some time to learn heavy-hitting skills that work against bosses, you do eventually get access to those as well. It's a brilliant weapon whose only downside is that it scales with Proficiency and Willpower. Those are stamina-influencing stats that do little for Khazan's strength, so you won't deal <em>quite</em> as much damage as you might with Dual Wield or Greatswords.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_best_weapon_in_First_Berserker__Khazan_">What is the best weapon in First Berserker: Khazan?</h2><p dir="ltr">We recommend <strong>specializing in two weapons</strong>, so you can change your approach depending on what situation you're facing. Spear is the easiest to learn and has the most potential for strong combos and crowd control. Dual Wield is our second pick thanks to its speed and versatility, even if it doesn't have quite the range of options you get from the spear.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> is a life sim, and so by necessity it includes a particularly obnoxious thing that most of us have to sweat every single day of our lives: money. In this case a fictional currency called Meows. Fortunately, it's a bit easier to make money in a video game like InZoi than it is in the real world, because the steps are clear and simple and don't change dramatically over time. <strong>InZoi even features a money cheat</strong> for those really looking to get ahead. But even by normal methods, once you know how to make money, you'll make money. This is good because you'll be hiring a maid service to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">deal with all the dirt that keeps filling up your house every day</a> before too long, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">that Hyundai Ioniq isn't gonna buy itself</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, the methods by which you'll earn your Meows in InZoi are fairly similar to how you'd do it on our Earth: Unless you win the lottery, you have to do some kind of work, be it a normal 9-5 job, some kind of freelance career, or even by undertaking criminal enterprises. But it's not always obvious how to do what you have to do to bring home that paper, and so we'll break it all down for you below with our list of ways to make cash in InZoi.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_InZoi_money_cheat">Use the InZoi money cheat</h2><p dir="ltr">We'll start with the shortcut. No judgement--the game's economy is a bit wonky out of the gate, so we don't blame you. To use the InZoi money cheat, you'll head into the settings. <strong>In the</strong> <strong>Psicat guide menu, you'll find a button that says "money cheat" that will grant you 100,000 meows each time you press it</strong>. Since the InZoi economy is pretty incoherent right now, there's no need to feel any guilt over cheating yourself some money at this stage of the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to use more traditional methods, however, keep reading for all other ways to make money (or Meows) in Inzoi.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Get_a_regular_job">Get a regular job</h2><p>It's the standard method for making money for most folks, and for good reason: You know exactly how much you'll make every week, and you'll earn it pretty much just for showing up. But this isn't necessarily a good way to get rich. Having a regular job is about stability and, in the case of a life sim video game, participating in one of the key rituals of modern society.</p><p dir="ltr">It's extremely easy to get an job in InZoi. You just have to open your smartphone, and click the Careers button at the bottom to show your options. You'll be able to apply for any job you want that way, and since it's not possible for the company to reject you, and there are no education or experience requirements for any career, you're guaranteed to get whatever you applied for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466939" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466939"></a><figcaption>You can work at an idol management company in Dowon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466939-20250326111450_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are two main types of jobs to choose from: the active ones where you actually have to play while you're at the office, and the "rabbit hole" ones, which send your Zoi offscreen to some place you cannot follow them to. The rabbit hole-type jobs are better for Zois with large families, since it's one less thing to worry about during the day, and the active careers are better for Zois who live alone or have a smaller family.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first get a job, you won't make much money, so you'll need to aim for a promotion. For the rabbit hole careers, that means being rested and fed when you head to work. For the active careers, it means doing all the tasks you're given. You can only have one job at a time, but having a day job doesn't preclude you from also earning money by the other methods below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Make_things_and_sell_them">Make things and sell them</h2><p dir="ltr">Everybody's had pretty much the same get-rich-quick scheme in The Sims for decades now: crafting stuff, like paintings and furniture, and then selling it for cash. The crafting methods available in InZoi are pretty much the same as what The Sims 4 offers: painting, writing books, composing music, and so on. The results, however, are less consistent than in The Sims. You might put together a "perfect" painting worth 5,000 Meows only to turn around and make a bad one that's only worth 15. This means that sometimes this type of career will feel <em>very</em> rewarding, and other times it'll just feel bad.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Resort_to_crimes">Resort to crimes</h2><p>You can also earn your Meows by less-than-honest methods, though it's likely you won't even see the options to do so at first--outright <strong>criminal acts are only possible for Zois who have bad karma</strong>. Fortunately, it's not difficult to get bad karma pretty quickly, as all you have to do is go outside and start being rude to everyone who walks by. After 15 minutes of insulting random people, you should start unlocking new options like shoving somebody to the ground, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">robbing ATMs</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466940" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466940"></a><figcaption>If you really need some quick cash, you can always rob an ATM.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466940-2025-03-26-15-30-54.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Just be careful, though, as there are major potential consequences, including jail time if you're caught doing a robbery--though we do have a guide to help you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">get out of jail in InZoi</a>. You even risk death under certain circumstances--you'd better not try breaking into an ATM when you're half asleep, as my Zoi learned when she was electrocuted to death during her first attempt.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Get_a_bank_loan">Get a bank loan</h2><p dir="ltr">When all else fails, and your Zoi's entire life is falling apart, you can try to get a loan from the bank to help get you through your tough circumstances. That said, the banks in InZoi don't give out money to just anybody--just like in the real world, the bank will have to approve you for a loan before it hands you the big check. But hey, at least there's an option that will make Animal Crossing fans feel at home.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Win_the_lottery">Win the lottery</h2><p dir="ltr">There are kiosks all over that you can buy a lotto ticket from, and if you're extraordinarily lucky you might win enough money to quit your job at the fire department. But you probably won't. </p>
