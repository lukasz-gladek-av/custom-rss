While most objectives in the campaign require you to slay beasts that you encounter, there are a few where you're asked to incapacitate them instead. However, this process is a lot more involved.

Sadly, the game doesn't really give you all the information that you need. Managing your inventory can also be an arduous task, leading to a bit of confusion.</p><h3 id="How_to_craft_traps_and_tranquilizers">How to craft traps and tranquilizers</h3><p>Here's how to make traps in Monster Hunter Wilds:</p><ul><li>Purchase a Trap Tool from the Provisioner NPC at any base.</li><li>Go to your tent to craft either a Pitfall Trap or a Shock Trap:  <ul><li>Pitfall Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Net - You can craft a Net by using 1x Ivy and 1x Spider Web.</li><li>Shock Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Thunderbug Capacitor.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Before you head out, make sure you have multiples of any tranquilizer-type item as well. These include:</p><ul><li>Tranq Bomb: Requires 1x Sleep Herb and 1x Parashroom</li><li>Tranq Blade: Requires 1x Tranq Bomb and 1x Throwing Knife (you have an infinite number of these).</li><li>Tranq Ammo: Requires 1x Tranq Bomb and 1x Normal Ammo (you have an infinite number of these).</li></ul><p>Having several Tranq Bombs should be fine. Just remember to have your Pitfall Trap/Shock Trap and Tranq Bomb in your item pouch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451163" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451163"></a><figcaption>Don't forget your traps and tranquilizers before you leave your base.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_set_up_traps">How to set up traps</h3><p>Now, all that's left is to battle a particular beast until they're severely weakened. You'll notice this once you see a notification at the right-hand side of your screen telling you that you should use traps. You'll also see the creature limping away to another location. Follow it and, in most cases, you'll see it resting due to its injuries.</p><p>Place a trap nearby and attack the monster once. Move near the trap to lure the creature toward you. Once the trap has been activated, use several of your Tranq Bombs via your item pouch until the beast is incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Once a creature has been weakened it's important that you dismiss any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-ai-companions-sos-flare-guide/1100-6529744/" data-ref-id="1100-6529744"><strong>AI companion</strong></a> that's with you on a quest, since the damage that they deal might kill the monster instead. You can dismiss companions by pressing Start and going to the Missions &amp; Quests tab. Then, Select Support Hunter Info and remove the AI teammates from your party.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451164-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451164-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451164"></a><figcaption>Place down a trap once a beast has been weakened.

The difference between this process and slaying a creature is that you won't get to carve its carcass. Also, the vast majority of main quests simply require you to "hunt" or "slay" beasts. You wouldn't need to worry about capturing creatures alive except in certain missions that have this particular requirement.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to trap and capture monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds. </p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

The trailer features a lot of live-action footage hearkening back to Pokemon's earliest days, showing kids battling by system link on Game Boy systems. The trailer also played into nostalgia by showing sequences of the popular N64 game Pokemon Stadium, which was all about battling. Pokemon Champions is an extension of this legacy and now allows players to do battle on Switch and mobile devices against each other, wherever they live, thanks to the internet. The trailer doesn't show much gameplay footage, though.</p><p>What we do see is a 2v2 battle featuring Charizard and Cetitan on a massive battle stage.

                <p>Change is in the air for the Metro developer previously known as 4A Games, as the studio has announced a rebrand to Reburn and its next game, La Quimera. Originally founded in 2006, the newly rechristened Reburn says that La Quimera will represent a big departure when compared to its work on Metro, and the studio describes the game as an action-packed first-person shooter with a "heavy focus" on narrative, world design, and characters. A release date has not yet been set for the game, but it is coming to PC.</p><p>The new game also features some Hollywood star power, as its world and narrative has been created and written by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) alongside Reburn's EJA Warren. A combination of Latin-American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera can be played either in single-player or with two other people in its co-op mode. La Quimera puts players inside the exosuit of a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier, and it'll feature both metropolitan and jungle settings to explore.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8u_qFKhoB8c" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” Reburn CEO and founder Dmytro Lymar said in a press release. "We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight."</p><h2>La Quimera screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449822,1300-4449823,1300-4449824,1300-4449825,1300-4449826,1300-4449827,1300-4449828,1300-4449829,1300-4449830,1300-4449831,1300-4449832,1300-4449833,1300-4449834,1300-4449835" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"></figure><p>Prior to its rebranding to Reburn, 4A Games became notable over the years for its adaptations of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro books.

A VR spin-off called Metro Awakening also arrived last year.</p>

                <p>Velan Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a> will be taking hide-and-seek into some lethal places on the game's new early-access launch date, March 13. This first-person shooter places 1-6 players on equal ground by forcing them to explore Wormwood Manor in complete darkness except for their flashlights and the flicker of light when a gun is fired. But things are going to get even wilder with two new gameplay modes.</p><p>Within Midnight Murder Club's new Wildcards mode, the battle royale in the mansion is upended by cards that can rewrite the laws of reality around them. When players pick cards from their collection, they can given special abilities like super speed or the power to self-detonate upon death. Some of those powers will extend to the other players in the match as well. At the end of each battle, players are given new cards to experiment with as they embrace the chaos around them.</p><p>The Guest Pass Edition doesn't change the actual gameplay like the Wildcards mode, but it does let additional players join in even if they don't own a copy of the game. As long as at least one person owns Midnight Murder Club, they can invite five other people to play the game for free. Presumably the Guest Pass Edition will also be available with the game's other modes, including Free for All, Thief in the Night, Team Deathmatch, and Headhunters.</p><p>Players can purchase the full game for approximately $20, and the Guest Pass Edition will be available on day one for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
