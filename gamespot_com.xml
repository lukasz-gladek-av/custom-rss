                <p>Carmen Sandiego has been traveling the world since 1985, evading capture as she steals some of the most valuable artifacts on the planet, and soon she'll be setting off on a new heist with the new puzzle-adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-carmen-sandiego-game-has-you-play-as-master-thief-for-first-time/1100-6526356/" data-ref-id="1100-6526356">Carmen Sandiego</a> on PS5, Xbox Series X, Switch, PC, and Netflix (as a mobile game).

                <p>Parkour has been an important part of the Assassin's Creed franchise from the beginning, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will be making some adjustments to the acrobatic running style. Ubisoft has already hinted that Naoe--one of Shadows' new leading characters--can Naruto run in the game. But that's just the beginning of what she can pull off while running.</p><p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd/assassins-creed-shadows-parkour-system-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared an extensive breakdown</a> of Shadow's new parkour options, as well as the revised button map for the game. One of the most notable changes is that the crouch and the dodge buttons have traded places. That will allow the player to either crouch or lie in a prone position. Naoe can even kill her targets while lying prone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uTuL0Ob2EnU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke--the game's other lead character--and Naoe can both perform dodges while crouched, but only the latter can pull off a dodge in her prone stance. The other new parkour moves that Naoe can pull off include a wall-run eject and a backward dodge, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXehGq8UkuM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WXehGq8UkuM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the parkour and climbing moves can be performed by both Yasuke and Naoe, but she's more suited for those because she's light on her feet and able to pull off a recovery roll while falling.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Yq6RcLE8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/33Yq6RcLE8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The developers also noted that not every wall surface in the game will be climbable for either character. The grappling hook can help players overcome some of those areas, but they will also have to be on the lookout for surfaces that have physical handholds to grab.</p><p>For players who don't want to deal with romances or branching narrative paths, Shadows will have a Canon Mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-can-make-all-of-the-big-choices-for-you/1100-6528401/" data-ref-id="1100-6528401">will make the big story decisions for you</a>.

A few of the details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">the game's battle pass</a> have leaked online, and Ubisoft has stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-clarifies-rumors-about-animus-hub-the-new-name-of-assassins-creed-infinity/1100-6527804/" data-ref-id="1100-6527804">the rewards in the Animus Hub will be free</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

                <p>Nvidia finally revealed their next-generation RTX 50-series graphics cards at CES 2025, with some big performance improvements expected thanks to the new Blackwell architecture. But since 2020 and the launch of the RTX 20 series, Nvidia has been working on and expanding its range of AI enhancements as part of its DLSS suite of exclusive features, with its latest iteration, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss4-multi-frame-generation-ray-tracing-rtx-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DLSS 4</a>, set to propel both new and older GPUs forward.</p><p>DLSS 4's biggest new feature is one that will be exclusive to the new RTX 50-series GPUs. Multi Frame Generation is the next step in the Frame Generation race that Nvidia kicked off with the RTX 40-series range. Instead of just injecting a single, AI-generated frame between two traditionally rendered one, Multi Frame Generation now offers up to four AI-generated frames to be inserted, substantially increasing a game's frame rate. Nvidia says that its new GPUs can deliver nearly eight times more performance than "brute-force" rendering, but how well each generated frame looks and how this impacts input latency has yet to be determined.</p><p>Digital Foundry was given access to an engineering sample of the RTX 5080 and limited time to test Multi Frame Generation in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and came away impressed with both the image quality and fluidity of the experience.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpzufsxtZpA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xpzufsxtZpA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perhaps more interesting are the DLSS 4 improvements that will be supported on all of Nvidia's RTX GPUs. Nvidia has updated its transformer model that powers DLSS Super Sampling, Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA for the first time, moving away from its previous convolutional neural networks approach. What this means is that its newer model is more adept at identifying parts of a rendered image that are important and with more granularity, offering up more stable upscaling and ray-tracing quality as a result.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423817"></a><figcaption>Breakdown of DLSS 4 enhancements for various RTX GPU generations</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15853545/4423817-0726012417-nvidi.jpg"></figure><p>DLSS Super Resolution (Nvidia's AI-enhanced upscaling solution), Ray Reconstruction, and DLAA will be improving thanks to this upgrade across all RTX hardware, starting with the RTX 20 series. Nvidia is also adding the ability to switch between specific DLSS releases from within its GeForce Experience application in the near future, which previously had to be manually done for each game if you wanted to experiment with newer DLSS versions that hadn't been patched in by developers. This can potentially give some new life to older hardware, at least from an image-quality standpoint.</p><p>There's no question that the headline feature for DLSS 4 is the one that only works on Nvidia's latest and greatest hardware, which starts shipping later this month and will be supported in over 75 games and apps immediately. But unlike the update for Frame Generation with the RTX 40 series launch, there's a lot more to get excited about for the many more already on Nvidia's platform.</p>
