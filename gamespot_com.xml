              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There was once a time when having a full-blown computer in your pocket was still a fairly novel concept, and game developers, publishers, and console-makers were all too eager to find ways to work their existing products and franchises into mobile apps. Some of these were terrible, offering cheap imitations of their big siblings and often charging exorbitant prices for microtransactions, but there were also a whole bunch that took a different approach. Around the end of the Xbox 360/PS3 generation, developers often found intuitive and genuinely helpful ways to pair mobile apps with their games. No longer did they feel like <a href="https://tenor.com/view/cash-grab-tim-robinson-tim-and-eric-i-think-you-should-leave-tim-cash-grab-gif-27711004" rel="nofollow ">cash grabs</a>--instead, they showed how mobile devices could enhance and supplement the traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">And then they started disappearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like Kinect functionality, DualShock 4 touchpad support, and motion-control spin-offs, the mobile companion app slowly went the way of the dinosaur. The catalyst for writing this piece came when I decided to load up the Battlefield Companion app. It was a great way to check statistics and fine-tune loadouts, saving time that could then be spent actually playing games like Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1. It's something I sorely miss in Battlefield 6, as taking time to change my loadout means I either need to leave matchmaking and delay the fun, or spend the first moments of a Conquest game swapping out gun parts, hoping my teammates don't hate me.</p><p dir="ltr">When Battlefield 4 released--broken as it was at launch--it even included a tablet-specific feature that let mobile players act as a commander, giving them a map-view perspective of the action while players on console and PC duked it out below. Was it an essential part of the experience? Certainly not, but it was an undeniably positive addition, and it no longer exists for little reason other than cost and resource allocation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dgZTeVnM5Sw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty did almost the exact same thing with its own companion app. Sure, there are the very popular full-fledged games Call of Duty: Mobile and Warzone Mobile (itself later sunset), but these largely scratch the same itch as the console/PC titles. A companion app doesn't try to replace the original, but instead aims to make the experience better. We all think about how we could make that one sniping loadout a little bit stronger when we're not sitting down at the keyboard. Why jot a few ideas in the Notes app when we could just swap out a gun or an attachment immediately?</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, these apps weren't just limited to competitive shooters; everything from action-adventure games to RPGs tried out their own versions during this period. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag offered an interactive map and--my favorite part--unlocked sea shanties after getting them in-game, letting you play the singalong pirate music wherever you happened to be. <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3:_Datapad" rel="nofollow ">Mass Effect 3: Datapad</a> offered the game's codex so you could read up on various plot elements while on the go, and its Galaxy At War component let you actively prepare your squad for the final mission. I have fond memories of doing this on the long bus ride to school every morning for weeks, and now it's simply not an option for new players.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most egregious example of the decline of companion apps being to games' detriment is with sports. We saw it used in a limited fashion on Madden via Xbox's SmartGlass app, but we're still in an era where the honor system has to be used when playing a local competitive football game. You have a perfectly good phone in your pocket--why we haven't made phone-based playcalling a standard feature in Madden by this point is beyond me. This option wouldn't be a gimmick, but an objectively fairer <em>and </em>more realistic way to play competitive football.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvIEmg5hFX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cvIEmg5hFX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rather than choosing from a few selected plays on screen and hoping your friend can't figure out which one you actually picked, you'd have access to your entire playbook.</p><p dir="ltr">The proliferation of smartphones might be the reason we've seen companion apps dwindle over the years, however. With the rise of cloud-gaming services, more and more titles are playable entirely on a phone. Why just check statistics or swap a loadout when you could be playing the entire game on the go? There are lots of reasons why you would still want to do this, of course, but they don't seem to be of the utmost importance to those making decisions. Services like Xbox Cloud Gaming aren't even limited to phones, either--you could be accessing a cloud-based Xbox game on a console or a smart TV while still having access to your phone! If we want games on more devices, like Microsoft seems so enthusiastic about, it will certainly do that.</p><p dir="ltr">Not every companion app has been a success, of course, so this isn't a call for every developer to find a way to shoehorn in some sort of functionality. That's what Nintendo attempted to do when the company, in its infinite wisdom, separated voice chat from game applications themselves on Nintendo Switch, instead requiring a separate connection to its Nintendo Switch Online app. It makes the experience messier, resulting in very low usage among players, which is one way to make sure younger players aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language â€¦ it just also makes sure older players also aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language.</p><p dir="ltr">It's very possible we eventually see the pendulum swing back to widespread companion-app support, provided the industry has moved past whatever its latest C-suite-directed obsession happens to be. Regardless of whether companion apps can be cool again in the age of useless AI and metaverse integration, however, they <em>deserve </em>to be cool again. Don't rob us of the simple joy of playing a sea shanty at full volume in a coffee shop to show your friends how good you are at Assassin's Creed, or of switching that under-barrel foregrip attachment for a slightly different under-barrel foregrip attachment at 2 AM after you woke up to pee. This is what gaming is all about.</p>

                <p>Whenever your Pokemon buddies are in need of healing, you can always depend on that friendly Pokemon Center nurse. These NPCs always had identical character models in mainline Pokemon RPGs, but Pokemon Legends: Z-A turns these attendants into visually distinct characters.</p><p>Pokemon Center nurses in Legends: Z-A all share the same hairstyle, featuring those iconic hair loops that recall the Nurse Joy character from the Pokemon anime series. But in Lumiose City, every attendant has a different appearance, with varying skin tones and facial features.</p><p>And these characters have their own identities as well--one side mission even has you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaDiM2S1g8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle a Pokemon Center clerk</a> named Bien (which translates to "good" or "well" in French). It's not revolutionary compared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/pokemon-legends-z-a-22-biggest-changes/2300-6466370/" data-ref-id="2300-6466370">other changes in Legends: Z-A</a>, but it's a step towards adding some personality to the series.</p><p>While these Pokemon Center workers are generally referred to as Nurse Joy by fans, the name is rarely used in the mainline Pokemon games and originates from the anime. The show explains the appearance of all Nurse Joys by making them all nearly identical family members.</p><p>The only core games that had Nurse Joy characters by name were Pokemon Yellow and its remakes Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, as those titles were heavily influenced by the anime.</p><p>Of course, there's a lot more to Lumiose City outside of the Pokemon Centers--you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-guides-hub/1100-6535458/" data-ref-id="1100-6535458">GameSpot's guides for Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which is now out for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.

                <p>In an open letter, EA employees have publicly criticized the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">proposed $55 billion sale to an investor consortium</a>, warning that the deal could have dire consequences for the people who make EA's games. The letter comes as EA prepares to go private under the new ownership of Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, Silver Lake, and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, pending regulatory approval.</p><p>"EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed," the employees posted on the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout" rel="nofollow ">United Videogame Workers union website</a>, referencing fears that EA will undergo mass layoffs as part of its plans to finance its new debt. "We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation."</p><p>The letter also called on regulators and elected officials to heavily scrutinize the deal to ensure that jobs will be protected if it's approved. At the same time, the CWA is also preparing to organize its members if and when ownership of the company changes hands, in an effort to protect EA's employees. "As a unified voice, we, the members of the industry-wide video game workers' union UVW-CWA, are standing together and refusing to let corporate greed decide the future of our industry," the letter concluded.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-saudi-deal-draws-scrutiny-from-us-senators-over-foreign-influence/1100-6535453/" data-ref-id="1100-6535453">have also taken note of the buyout</a>, and they recently co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, listing their fears that Saudi Arabia's ownership might pose a "national security" risk. Over the last couple of years, the PIF has made numerous investments--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">or outright purchases</a>--in several video game companies as part of plans to diversify its economy, including stakes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabias-400-billion-wealth-fund-invests-in-ea-activision-blizzard-and-take-two/1100-6487651/">Activision Blizzard, Take-Two</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/">Embracer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-now-owns-5-of-nintendo/1100-6503575/">Nintendo</a>.</p><p>The country also struck a 12-year pact with the International Olympic Committee to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a>, and WWE Wrestlemania 43 will also be hosted in the country in 2027. Critics have labeled these investments as "sportswashing" designed to cover up Saudi Arabia's <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">record of human rights violations</a> on the international stage.</p>
