                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/" data-ref-id="5000-654217">A Game About Digging A Hole</a> is the aptly named new game from indie developer Cyberwave, and it is, you guessed it, about digging a hole.</p><p dir="ltr">For what Cyberwave describes "costs as much of a coffee, but is fun for longer," A Game About Digging A Hole sees players buy a mysterious house for an "unbeatable price." That house just so happens to have buried treasure in the backyard, leading players to start digging to discover the riches underneath.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ys4PRZxsw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a simple premise with an even simpler gameplay loop. Players will dig, find treasure, sell those treasures, use the money to upgrade their digging tools, and keep digging deeper. The game's announcement trailer teases there may be something more sinister lurking in the deep, dark depths, but that will be for players to discover, as Cyberwave teases a "big secret" hidden beneath the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">An eye-catching and hilariously straightforward name definitely seems to be part of the game's marketing strategy. In a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Cyberwave asks players to help make the "quirky" project "go viral" so that it's "the game everyone's talking about."</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea for the game came during the development of Cyberwave's upcoming floating island survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solarpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-559930">Solarpunk</a>. It was experimenting with voxel-based terraforming, only to eventually ditch the idea. One of the game's artists, inspired by the tech and the game Motherload, then put together what would become A Game About Digging A Hole in just 14 days of his spare time. Solarpunk itself is not out yet and is planned for a 2025 release, but Cyberwave emphasized that A Game About Digging A Hole didn't take a single day from Solarpunk's development.</p><p dir="ltr">A Game About Digging A Hole doesn't have an exact release date or price just yet but is slated to arrive in 2025 for PC.</p>

Localthunk and PlayStack have announced Friends Of Jimbo 3, a free update to the card-based roguelike which brings eight more friendly faces to face cards for your next run.</p><p dir="ltr">The pack was announced in a new trailer starring Ben Starr--the voice off Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI, Prometheus in Hades II, and more--as the Balatro jester Jimbo. The trailer also introduces all eight guests included in Friends of Jimbo 3, which range from indie hits to robust RPGs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r1LVgAGXlE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1r1LVgAGXlE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The list of games included in the Balatro Friends Of Jimbo 3 pack is below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Divinity: Original Sin 2</li><li dir="ltr">Donâ€™t Starve</li><li dir="ltr">Enter the Gungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Cult of the Lamb</li><li dir="ltr">1000x Resist</li><li dir="ltr">Potion Craft</li><li dir="ltr">Shovel Knight</li><li dir="ltr">Warframe</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Balatro is a roguelike deckbuilder where players use traditional playing cards to score as many points as possible against "blinds." Scores can be multiplied using Joker cards, which provide temporary buffs, as well as Planet and Tarot cards, which add permanent boosts to a particular run.</p><p dir="ltr">The surprise indie smash hit launched on consoles and PC in February, with the mobile version following in September. It has seen over 3.5 million downloads since its initial release, and its success has garnered five nominations at The Game Awards, including Game Of The Year, Best Game Direction, and Best Independent Game. It was also one of GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">Top 10 Games Of The Year for 2024</a>.</p>
