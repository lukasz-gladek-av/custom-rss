                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, May 23, 2025. Below, we look back at how its villains were unusually sympathetic, lending weight to the story.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's one of the most haunting scenes in any Fire Emblem game. A soldier and temporary king, Orson, is seen talking with the reanimated corpse of his wife, Monica. She only says one thing--"darling"--over and over again.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson, one of the many antagonists in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones-review/1900-6126647/">Fire Emblem Sacred Stones</a>, was a man devoted to Monica long before the campaign of the game began. He's only present during a short part of the story, but he leaves a major impression once the credits roll after the game's 30 chapters come to a close. While you'll first meet him as a playable character, he eventually betrays Ephraim, Eirika, and the other heroes in order to (as he believes) save his wife's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though this story plays out solemnly on a 2.5 inch Game Boy screen, it packs a punch that remains one of the most memorable parts of Fire Emblem: Sacred Stones. Orson's tale, along with those of the other villains in Sacred Stones, exemplifies the type of personal story that sets the Fire Emblem series apart from other strategy games. It provides a personal, intimate look at enemies before we fight them on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LmocGJOdZk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9LmocGJOdZk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Orson's betrayal comes as a shock. When the idea of a turncloak hiding in Eirika and Ephraim's forces is brought up by an enemy commander, it's not immediately clear who he's referring to. We find out when Orson tries to trick Eirika into handing over one of the keys to the games namesake, the sacred stones, while leading her right into the hands of the enemy. Then, he's dismissed and nearly disappears from the story.</p><p dir="ltr">We see him nine chapters later in a terrible state, living for nothing but the reanimated corpse of his wife. We witness brief scenes where he brings her gifts and lashes out at the people around him for the mere act of interrupting their time alone. These moments are short, intimate looks at an unwound man who has forsaken everything in his life for the memory of his love. Our last look at Orson comes from combat dialogue right before he is killed.</p><p dir="ltr">"For the one I love, I betray everything," Orson tells Eirika before they cross swords near the halfway point of Sacred Stone's campaign. "My country, my lord and master… everything."</p><p dir="ltr">While few would endorse his actions, it's easy to understand why Orson made them. Laying the scene out before us--as unsettling as it is--puts him in the spotlight as if he was one of the games' protagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">We get a similarly personal look at Lyon, the prince of Grado who serves as the secondary antagonist in Sacred Stones, that gives plenty of weight to his villainy. Like Orson, one of Lyon's primary drivers is saving someone close to him through experimentation with dangerous magic. He uses the sacred stone, which is a seal that helps contain a powerful demon, to push healing magic, which isn't known to help with grievous injuries in the world of Sacred Stones, further than it's ever been pushed before.</p><p dir="ltr">"If I can just press my studies a little harder [...] I think I might be able to use it to heal my father’s illness," Lyon says at one point in the story. "If that works, there’s no telling how many other people I can help as well."</p><p dir="ltr">As you might have guessed, Lyon's experimentations backfire. He eventually loses control and is influenced by the demon sealed through the sacred stones, before being finally convinced that the only way to prevent a cataclysmic event is to free the demon.</p><p dir="ltr">We see the backstory of Lyon's father sickness, his childhood relationships with Ephraim and Eirika, and his struggles with his poor health and lack of self-confidence throughout the game. Flashbacks, combat dialogue, and story sequences lay out the motivations of a ruler in complete despair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303" data-ratio="0.66701461377871" data-width="958" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4499303"></a><figcaption>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4499303-fireemblem%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Getting such a sincere look at the villain's perspective is one way to convince us that Ephraim and his army aren't just cutting down evil, faceless enemies. The scenes with Orson and Lyon throughout the campaign overshadow the fantastical demonic villain that enters the fray later on.</p><p dir="ltr">Fire Emblem is a franchise that wants you to care about the units you fight with and against. You're not sending nameless soldiers to their deaths, you're sending characters that you've recruited, trained with, leveled up, and grown closer to over the course of the game. It's not uncommon for fans of the series to abort missions and start over as soon as one of their heroes falls on the battlefield. The thought of going on without them is too much.</p><p dir="ltr">Sacred Stones exemplifies this part of the franchise. Moulder, a gentle priest who acts as a father figure to other units and Joshua, a talented swordsman with an unhealthy obsession with gambling, are just two of the 30 units that you can learn about as you watch them interact with one another before each mission. Building out your go-to squad is like choosing which friends you want to spend time with over the course of the games' story.</p><p dir="ltr">Orson and Lyon--villains that are only roadblocks in the path to the game's main demonic antagonist--serve as sobering examples of villains who are tragically relatable. We see why they do what they do firsthand, giving them just as much of a story as any other character in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">Later Fire Emblem games have built on what entries like Sacred Stones established for the franchise. Fire Emblem: Engage and Fire Emblem: Three Houses gave us more ways to build relationships with our soldiers on the field. Few games, however, have given us an equally as disturbing look into what would drive good people to commit horrible crimes.</p>

"Guns are upgradable in Firebreak, but we now think we went too far with how weak they felt at the earliest levels," Kyatta said. "In response, we are making all level-one guns radically more powerful, while adjusting other parts of the game to maintain the challenge balance."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>

<p>Kyatta added that it heard from players that the double-barrel shotgun did not feel quite right, and the studio agrees, so it's making some changes to "make sure it meets the expectations of its shooting style." The developer also mentioned how "everything" related to general combat intensity and difficulty levels has been overhauled. "Among other things, we're tying different enemy types to different threat levels, adjusting wave frequency and composition, and removing awkward lulls in the action," Kyatta said.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Kyatta said Remedy has added "dynamic tutorials" to the game to help players have a "clear path forward without limiting them from discovering alternate ways of going about things."</p><p>Additionally, Kyatta mentioned how the "visual clarity" of FBC wasn't quite right. "The chaos stops being fun when players can no longer make meaningful decisions based on what they're experiencing." With that in mind, Remedy is spending time "cleaning up and reducing a lot of effects in the game, both on-screen and in-world."</p><p>What's more, Kyatta said it was a known issue that the general in-game audio was too quiet in the early tests. The studio is now putting together the final audio mix for the game that should address this.</p><p>Finally, Kyatta said Remedy continues to work on "performance testing and improvements" for PC, which is why the minimum and recommend PC specs have not been announced yet. "We'll share those results as soon as we're confident in them," Kyatta said.</p><p>"We've still got a lot to do to make the launch experience the best it can be, but the team is feeling really good about where we are," he added.</p><p>FBC officially launches on June 17, and it's included as a day-one launch title for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Alternatively, it can be purchased outright for $40 for console and PC.</p>

                <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has dropped its case against Microsoft that sought to block the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. The deal was already approved, but the FTC was appealing the decision.</p><p>A memo from the FTC states that, "The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed."</p><p>Microsoft president Brad Smith <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> this was a "victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C."</p><p>This result was expected. Earlier this month, a US appeals court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-scores-key-victory-in-activision-acquisition-with-ftc-appeal-denied/1100-6531378/" data-ref-id="1100-6531378">denied the FTC's appeal</a> of the original judgment that the Microsoft-Activision Blizzard deal could go through. It's not clear how the two companies could have been untangled had the appeal been successful.</p><p>To appease regulator concerns, Microsoft carved out deals to bring Xbox games to non-Xbox streaming platforms and also continue to release games on non-Xbox platforms. Microsoft is indeed doing that, and for April 2025 in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/" data-ref-id="2900-6605">five out of the top seven best-selling PS5 games were published by Xbox</a>.</p><p>The FTC's case against Microsoft was driven in part by FTC head Lina Khan. When President Trump took office in January 2025, he installed Andrew N. Ferguson as the new FTC chair.</p><p>Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion was Microsoft's biggest-ever acquisition by purchase price, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/" data-ref-id="2900-4718">biggest gaming buyout of all time.</a></p>

What's interesting here is that Id will make use of what it calls "Tunables," a system that allows it to update parts of the game without needing to release a patch.</p><p>While Tunables can't fix complex systemic, content, or code-related bugs, they can adjust parts of the new Doom game to create subtle but noticeable changes. Overall, players wanting to test their mettle on Nightmare difficulty can expect to start sweating, as enemies like the Cosmic Baron and Hellknight will start doing more damage. <a href="https://x.com/DOOM/article/1925721303987757124/media/1925707376557977600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Id says that it wanted to increase the threat level</a> of these enemies on Nightmare difficulty, and as an example, missing a parry on the Agaddon Hunter's overhead slash will break your shield and leave you vulnerable for a short period.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Doom: The Dark Ages Has a Power Problem</p>
      </div>
<p>"There are systems under the hood that are designed to give players a better chance to survive when near death, and those systems were being too generous," Id explained. "Players were able to brute-force their way through situations that should've resulted in costing a Life Sigil or death, and we want to make sure we are keeping the player in check and asking for better tactical decisions. These changes will have an impact on player survivability and will be more noticeable the higher up the Damage Scale slider you go."</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-hits-3-million-players-right-away-and-the-majority-of-them-are-on-game-pass-apparently/1100-6531702/">and right out of the gate, it hit 3 million players</a>. That's seven times quicker than Doom Eternal, but it's worth noting that 2 million players came from Game Pass alone, as The Dark Ages was a day-one release on that service. While that figure is impressive, it's still not clear if The Dark Ages is doing well commercially, given how cagey Bethesda is with details on development and marketing costs for the game.</p><p>"Doom: The Dark Ages reinvents and reins in with equal measure, taking the series in a bold new direction without straying from its captivating roots," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>.</p>

                <p>Google has released a new AI video generation tool, and it's clearly very familiar with what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> gameplay looks like. The advanced AI tool generated some very convincing Fortnite footage in response to a simple prompt, churning out a clip that's almost indistinguishable from the real thing.</p><p>Veo 3, the latest video generation model from Google DeepMind, released this week, and already is creating some concerningly realistic footage with its added capacity to generate lifelike audio. The AI tool is also showing a blatant disregard for intellectual property--which may be of more concern to many of the companies that have been quick to implement AI technology.</p><p>As picked up by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dystopian-google-ai-video-generator-generating-fake-fortnite-clips-and-its-tough-to-tell-the-difference" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, X user <a href="https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/1924994290729599222" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Matt Schumer</a> posted a short clip generated by Veo 3 that shows a streamer winning a game of Fortnite. While it looks a little odd to have the streamer's face cam superimposed over a shot of a computer monitor, rather than direct gameplay footage, the clip is otherwise indistinguishable from real Fortnite gameplay.</p><p>Schumer later shared that the prompt for the clip didn't actually mention Fortnite at all, and was just nine words long--"Streamer getting a victory royale with just his pickaxe." While a direct prompt to generate Fortnite footage would get blocked by Veo's content filters, Schumer discovered that key terms like "Victory Royale" and "pickaxe" were enough for the tool to understand that he was talking about Fortnite. Schumer also showed that the AI tool will generate pure gameplay footage without a streamer overlay.</p><p>Veo 3's ability to generate such convincing Fortnite footage shows that the tool has likely been trained on plenty of copyrighted content, and raises interesting questions about how copyright law will handle generative AI. It's yet to be seen if Epic--or any other company whose IPs can be this easily copied by AI--will do anything in response.</p><p>Epic Games also uses AI tools, including in the development of Fortnite. Most recently, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">allowed players to interact with</a> an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI-powered Darth Vader</a> who interacts with the player in the voice of James Earl Jones. Voice actors union SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">filed a complaint</a> against Epic Games for its use of AI voice acting.</p>

                <p>A big new update for SteamOS is here, after months of development in beta. SteamOS Version 3.7.8 includes a lot of fixes and improvements on a system level, and will also introduce a battery saver feature for the Steam Deck for the first time.</p><p>The new battery saver option is called Battery Charge Limit, and can be found under the Power submenu in Settings. The feature allows users to set a maximum charge limit for their Steam Deck, with a maximum of 80% charge recommended for devices that are usually left on charge, or that rarely have their battery fully depleted.</p><p>This kind of feature, designed to prolong the working life of lithium-ion batteries, is already commonly implemented in devices like mobile phones and laptops, and now is starting to become more common in the gaming space. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-a-switch-2-setting-that-prevents-its-battery-from-deteriorating/1100-6531462/" data-ref-id="1100-6531462">Nintendo recently revealed</a> that the Switch 2 will have a similar feature, which will stop the hybrid handheld console from charging once it reaches 90%.</p><p>The SteamOS update also includes a number of other notable changes that will improve the OS from the ground up--with upgrades to the system's Linux base, and the Mesa graphics driver base. Version 3.7.8 will also improve the Steam Deck's desktop experience, with an upgrade to Plasma 6.2.5 for an overall smoother and more modern desktop experience.</p><p>The latest update also improves support for third-party devices, including AMD-powered devices like the ROG Ally and original Lenovo Legion Go, as well as adding official support for the newer Legion Go S.</p><p>SteamOS users can also expect a decent amount of other bug fixes, compatibility improvements and other enhancements to the system.
