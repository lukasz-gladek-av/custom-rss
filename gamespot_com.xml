                <p>The middle of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-battle-pass-season-20-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-7337/" data-ref-id="2900-7337">Overwatch 2 Season 20</a> has arrived, and the midcycle is bringing the chaos with new modes, new loot, and new in-game collectibles. One of the most notable new additions is Showdown Shuffle, which runs January 13-26. This mode is going to change which character you're controlling, often at random intervals.</p><p>Showdown Shuffle locks players into a role, but not a particular hero. Instead, hero swaps can occur when players reach certain milestones for kills or assists, or even when players are eliminated. According to Blizzard, this was done to encourage players to experiment with new characters and adapt on the fly. Showdown Shuffle will be a 5v5 battle available in Control, Hybrid, Escort, Push, and Flashpoint. Match modifiers will also change throughout the battle for more unpredictable outcomes.</p><p>Starting today through January 11, Assault will return during a Quick Play Hacked event that brings back classic Overwatch maps Temple of Anubis, Hanamura, and Volskaya Industries. It's a fitting start the year, considering that 2026 will mark the 10th anniversary of Overwatch.</p><p>Later in the month, from January 22 to 25, Junkrat's Loot Hunt will let player spend a weekend chasing rewards and earning loot boxes at their own pace. There won't be any progress resets during this event and every match counts on the way to potentially earning as many as nine loot boxes before the end of the weekend.</p><p>Doomfist is getting a new Mythic Magma Titan Doomfist Hero Skin, which Blizzard describes as channeling "blazing energy through a sleek streetwear style." There are four upgrade tiers for the skin that can add new gauntlets, colors, and even customized effects for Doomfist's sounds and abilities.</p><p>Widowmaker, Lúcio, and Reinhardt are also getting Cosmic Owl Skins that are timed for release alongside live esports moments in Season 20. Two new collections are also coming to the shop. From today through January 19, the Borealis Collection will give Mercy, Wuyang, Lifeweaver, Sojourn, and Echo a chilly makeover composed of "celestial forms shaped by frost, starlight, and Arctic power." That collection will be followed by the Heist Collection from January 13 to 26. These outfits give Roadhog, Reaper, and Ash "gritty underworld looks" without a whiff of Christmas or winter themes.</p><p>Season 20 will reintroduce Drives from January 30 to February 4, which will give players a chance to earn exclusive rewards while pushing their progression further. Blizzard is promising that wins and losses will be forgiving in the early stages of Drive. But the higher players climb, the battles will be considerably higher as they work to increase their Drive score across Core Competitive and Stadium.</p><p>Before that happens, however, there's going to be a competitive reset. Until then, players need to finish strong to secure their rewards while earning titles, Galactic skins, and Competitive Points.</p>
