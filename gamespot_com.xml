                <p dir="ltr">Firaxis is focused on quality-of-life improvements with Sid Meier's Civilization VII, resulting in a previously announced in-game event being pushed back to a future date. As such, it's not included alongside the new patch rolling out today, which brings UI improvements and the reintroduction of cross-play between PC and consoles to the strategy game.</p><p dir="ltr">Called Update 1.1.0, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" rel="nofollow ">the Civilization website</a> notes that the planned Natural Wonder Battle event has been "postponed to a later update." Instead, Firaxis is using this patch to address player feedback. That includes "UI adjustments," major alterations to "the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory," and a "balance pass on several Mementos." The Bermuda Triangle will also be a new discoverable natural wonder.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/">Civilization VII quality-of-life fixes have been targeted</a> by Firaxis even before the strategy game's full launch (there was an early-access release).

Looking ahead, it's currently scheduled for Civilization VII to receive Update 1.1.1 on March 25, featuring further UI improvements as well as AI adjustments regarding scouting and settling.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/">Civilization VII review</a>.

                <p>Acclaim, an iconic game publisher from the 1990s behind series like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-jam/" data-ref-id="5000-2852">NBA Jam</a>, has been revived as an indie-game publisher.</p><p>Acclaim was founded in 1987 and made a name for itself in many ways. It was known for licensed games, ranging from NBA Jam to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/justice-league-task-force/" data-ref-id="5000-16280">Justice League Task Force</a>, being the console publisher for arcade classics like Mortal Kombat, and its wild marketing stunts promoting games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/turok-evolution/" data-ref-id="5000-4168">Turok: Evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-man-2econd-coming/" data-ref-id="5000-3729">Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</a>. After several high-profile flops like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bmx-xxx/" data-ref-id="5000-4220">BMX XXX</a>, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and had been defunct--until now.</p><p>Companies like Striker Entertainment, Ridge Partners, Global Force Entertainment, VaynerFund, and JET Management have all come together to revive Acclaim as a game publisher that will "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises." It plans to provide funding, marketing, and PR support for any independent developers it works with. This new version of Acclaim is following in Atari's footsteps; Atari has also revitalized itself in recent years and reimagined classic titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">I, Robot.</a></p><p>It's unclear what specific franchises this new version of Acclaim has ownership over, as this initial announcement is more focused on confirming members of its new leadership team, like CEO Alex Jose. That also includes Jeff Jarrett, a Hall of Fame wrestler who worked with the old version of Acclaim on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwf-attitude/" data-ref-id="5000-2348">WWF titles</a>. "Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved," Jarrett said of the revival in a press release.</p><p>No new games were announced alongside this revival of Acclaim, although Josef teased that the company has "already signed some incredible titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>

                <p>A Gears of War collection is reportedly going to be announced this summer with a PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S release. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a> also reportedly is targeting a 2026 release window.</p><p>According to leaker ExTas1s, Microsoft is reportedly going to reveal a Gears of War collection during the upcoming Xbox Games Showcase in June. While the exact games in the rumored collection are unknown, it's likely going to at least include the first three, although the spin-off Gears of War: Judgment could be part of the package too.

Microsoft is reportedly having the Gears of War collection fill in the release calendar this year as E-Day isn't ready for launch yet. However, the leaker said that there's a slim chance that it could still make it out the door in 2025.</p><p>This leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1861854891389432228" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">correctly reported</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5 was being ported to PS5</a>.

                <p>It's become all too common in the video game industry for small developers to shut down if their game isn't deemed a success after its debut. Unfortunately for Studio Fizbin, the decision to close its doors can't even wait another two weeks for the release of its final game, Reignbreaker.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/studio-fizbin-shutting-down-after-reignbreaker-s-mid-march-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Studio Fizbin founder Alexander “Pepe” Pieper shared the news on <a href="https://www.studio-fizbin.com/fizbins-last-magic-trick" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's official site</a>. According to Pieper, the end of Studio Fizbin is happening in part because the dev team doesn't have a new project to work on after Reignbreaker is finished. Studio Fizbin's parent company, Thunderful, is also drastically cutting back on its internal development. Consequently, Studio Fizbin will be closing its doors after an 11-year run that included titles like The Inner World, The Inner World: The Last Wind Monk, Say No! More, Minute of Islands, and Lost at Sea.</p><p>However, Studio Fizbin will remain open long enough to ensure that its new roguelike action game, Reignbreaker, is "going to be the best game we've ever released." Following the game's debut on March 18, Studio Fizbin will provide post-launch support for Reignbreaker while helping its employees find new job opportunities in the industry.</p><p>"We want to thank every single one of our fans for your purchases, your fan art, your comments, your reviews, your passion, and your seemingly endless support," wrote Pieper. "And finally, we'd like to give the biggest thanks to our team--those who are here until the end, and the many others who have found a different path on the way. Fizbin and its games are defined by its team members, and you all made this the most inspiring place to perform the world's most difficult magic trick: making games."</p><p>Last year, there were large layoffs across the video game industry, and 2025 is already off to a rough start with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-studios-have-already-shut-down-in-2025-including-godfall-developer/1100-6528785/" data-ref-id="1100-6528785">the closure of Godfall developer Counterplay Games</a>, as well as Warner Bros.

                <p>Capcom has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 8 million copies in three days, a new record for the company. This is the fastest-selling game in Capcom's history, surpassing the previous record-holder Monster Hunter World by a sizable margin. When it first launched several years ago, Monster Hunter World reached five million sales in three days <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240312.html" rel="nofollow ">and has so far reached 25 million lifetime sales</a>. Monster Hunter Wilds still has some way to go to reach and possibly surpass that number, but with extensive post-launch plans in place, it has a fighting chance to do so.</p><p><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow ">According to Capcom</a>, several open betas, a big marketing push, and the broad appeal of Monster Hunter Wilds have helped it reach this milestone, and the company remains "firmly committed to satisfying the expectations" of players. On Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-top-5-all-time-on-steam-for-concurrent-players/1100-6529828/">Monster Hunter Wilds has set a record on that PC platform</a> by reaching the top five for concurrent players, with 1.3 million people on March 1, 2025. The other top four ahead of Monster Hunter Wilds are PUBG, Black Myth: Wukong, Palworld, and Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>Overall, the Monster Hunter franchise is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/">second-best-selling Capcom franchise of all time</a>, with Resident Evil still holding the top spot. Even with Wilds adding 8 million more sales--and counting--to the franchise, Resident Evil holds a significant lead with 176 million sales in total for the franchise. It's not too surprising, given that the franchise launched several years before Monster Hunter and it has more games in its library.</p><p>"There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/">Monster Hunter Wilds review</a>.

                <p>The Mobile World Conference: Barcelona event kicked off this week, and amidst several new tech reveals from dozens of companies, one of Samsung's divisions had an interesting concept for the potential future of portable game consoles. Essentially, Samsung envisions a scenario where bulky game consoles can be made more portable, using foldable-screen technology to fold them up and make them easier to carry around.</p><p>Samsung Display--a branch of the company that develops screen technology that other firms can purchase for their devices--showed off a Switch-like device at MWC: Barcelona (via <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/samsung-shows-off-quirky-pincer-phone-folding-console-and-flexi-briefcase-concepts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a>), demonstrating how a console could be made smaller by simply folding it in half. There are of course potential issues to watch out for that are common to foldable devices, as screens can only be folded so many times before they develop a signature crease, but the idea behind this concept design makes for a fascinating glimpse at what could be.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Samsung Display shows off some crazy new concepts at MWC 2025.<br>✅ Flexible Briefcase: this cabinbag unfolds into an 18.1" tablet<br>✅ Flex Gaming: a 7.2" gaming console with a foldable screen<br>✅ Next-gen OCF OLED panel that allows for a 5,000 nits peak brightness in a 10% window,… <a href="https://t.co/XBUHE5pbJ1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XBUHE5pbJ1</a></p>  — Alvin (@sondesix) <a href="https://twitter.com/sondesix/status/1896670398324031921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While current devices like the Steam Deck, ROG Ally, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> don't have a foldable screen, these companies could adopt this technology for future hardware. For now, it looks like the best way to carry around a portable games console will be to invest in a carrying case for it. The other alternative is to go retro, as older devices like the Game Boy, Nintendo DS, or the PlayDate are more pocket-friendly in design.</p><p>Modern smartphones are also capable gaming devices--Asus even sells one designed specifically for mobile gaming--and with a cradle device like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller-up-for-preorder-half-the-price-of-backbone/1100-6527392/" data-ref-id="1100-6527392">Backbone</a>, it's easy to make a session on one feel similar to a console experience.</p>

                <p>Konami has announced a brand-new entry in the fabled RPG series, Suikoden. It's called Suikoden Star Leap and it'll be on iOS and Android. Star Leap is free-to-play with microtransactions, and it's the first Suikoden game since 2012's Suikoden: The Woven Web of a Century, which was on PSP but never released outside of Japan.</p><p>The game follows a silent protagonist who's the son of the village chief, Hou. One night, the village is attacked. The hero, along with his friends Hisui, Shirin, and Shapur, embark on a new journey to restore peace to the village once again. Like every Suikoden game, Star Leap has 108 recruitable characters and the rest will be revealed at a later date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKOZqkjPcWk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WKOZqkjPcWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Star Leap also sees the return of pixel-art graphics, like the first two Suikoden games had, and breaking away from the 3D models of the previous three games.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/34239" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, producer Shinya Fujimoto said that Star Leap takes place between the events of Suikoden V and Suikoden I. Additionally, the first chapter of Star Leap will heavily feature Odessa Silverberg, the original leader of the Liberation Army in Suikoden I that the protagonist eventually becomes in charge of.</p><p>While no release date has been revealed for Suikoden Star Leap, a remaster of the first two Suikoden games is releasing soon. The bundle is called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-preorders-are-25-off-on-pc/1100-6526150/" data-ref-id="1100-6526150">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</a> and launches on March 6 for PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It features brand-new quality-of-life features such as adjustable battle speeds and auto-saves.</p>
