                <p>There have been plenty of solid fishing games over the years, but this new one ups the ante. Fish Hunters: The Most Ridiculous Fishing Simulator is a new PC game where players haul in fish with rods, but then the fish are vaulted into the sky and players blast away at them with automatic weapons. It sounds similar to the popular mobile game Ridiculous Fishing, but with a first-person perspective and more action.</p><p>From developer Dos Ivanes and publisher Polden Publishing, Fish Hunters riffs on the idea that fishing is boring (and in reality, it can be; after all, it's called fishing, not catching). "Fishing can be a total snoozefest, right?" a character says in the announcement trailer. "But not this one."</p><p>"In Fish Hunters, you ain't got time to get bored. Grab quests, search for the right fish in different bodies of water, and shoot that bad boy with everything you've got," the trailer narrator says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcRYaOuLf2k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mcRYaOuLf2k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fish Hunters includes more than 140 species of fish, ranging from little minnows to giant sea monsters, the developer says. Players will unlock new rods, lures, and bait as they progress, while the game supports solo play or co-op with up to four total players.</p><p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468330/Fish_Hunters_The_Most_Ridiculous_Fishing_Simulator/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo for Fish Hunters is out now on Steam</a>. A release date for the full game has not been announced.</p>

                <p>TinyBuild is returning to the town of Raven Brooks with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hello-neighbor-3/" data-ref-id="5000-650465">Hello Neighbor 3</a>, and now players can too with an open playtest. The "cozy yet eerie" game tasks players with exploring--and eventually escaping--the now-half-abandoned town of Raven Brooks.</p><p>The game's second playable prototype was announced in a video by lead developer and franchise creator Nikita Kolesnikov, who also gives a general rundown on what players will be able to discover in the playtest. The newest version of Hello Neighbor 3 features an all-new map that's "much closer to what it's meant to be," Kolesnikov.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHK4WtJvlvk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HHK4WtJvlvk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The player is tasked with exploring the houses that make up the town of Raven Brooks to find useful items, with the prototype's ultimate goal being to escape before a storm hits the town. Some of the houses are occupied, however--and the occupants may be less than happy with the player's intrusion.</p><p>In Hello Neighbor 3's "system-based world," players can approach every situation in a different way, using stealth, agility, brute force, or even diplomacy. The game's major selling point is that the town of Raven Brooks is a living, reactive sandbox--its inhabitants go about their lives if undisturbed, but can also react in new and different ways to player actions, opening up new pathways in the game.</p><p>Players can request access to the new prototype's playtest on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2789680/Hello_Neighbor_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hello Neighbor 3's Steam page</a>.</p><p>While the first Hello Neighbor game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hello-neighbor-review/1900-6416829/" data-ref-id="1900-6416829">reviewed poorly by critics</a> on release, publisher TinyBuild has still managed to spin a whole franchise out of the game, including multiple spin-off games, books, and an animated show.</p>
