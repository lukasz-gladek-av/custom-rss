                <p dir="ltr">Great news if you're looking to complete your collection of physical Final Fantasy releases on Switch--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGBTNHF?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX</a> Switch physical editions are finally launching in North America. These originally launched in Japan and Europe a few years ago, but US fans were stuck with digital versions on the eShop. While you could import and play the physical versions from other regions thanks to the Switch's region-free hardware, these new US releases will (hopefully) be easier to find when they launch on December 9. Preorders for both games are now live at Amazon for $40 each. While there are no preorder bonuses announced at this time, it's still worth securing early copies, since physical Final Fantasy Switch releases tend to be very popular.</p><p dir="ltr">All three games offer the same core experience as the original PS1 RPGs, but with HD graphics and higher resolution presentation. Final Fantasy VIII Remastered in particular features new character models that are more detailed than the PS1's--though they still resemble the PS1's 3D models' art direction, and use the original animations, so it's not a <em>huge</em> change. All three games also feature optional toggles to turn off random encounters, make your characters invincible, and more. While these are Switch games, you can of course play them on Switch 2 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">With these new Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack and Final Fantasy IX physical releases, it's now possible to grab physical editions of almost every mainline Final Fantasy game--plus some of its best spinoffs--on Switch. The first six entries in the series are all included in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition</a>, and the Switch version is on sale for $69 (was $75). Though if you're looking for the best deal, it's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also available on PS4</a> for just $53. The pixel remaster versions of these games maintain the classic 2D gameplay of the NES and SNES RPGs, but feature new pixel art (and not the ugly redrawn sprites of the mobile re-releases from a few years ago), as well as other tweaks like the ability to play with the original chiptune soundtracks or new orchestrated versions, optional battle speed and difficulty settings, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For the later entries in the series, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster</a>, which includes Final Fantasy X and its sequel, Final Fantasy X-2. These versions feature upscaled graphics, orchestrated soundtracks, and the extra content from the International Editions of both games, including the roguelike mystery dungeon-style bonus game FFX-2: Last Mission. The CG short Final Fantasy X: Eternal Calm--which bridges X and X-2--and the audio drama Final Fantasy X: Will are also included in the collection. The Switch edition is on sale for just $25 (was $50).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4582996"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4582996-tacticschronicles.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is available on Nintendo's handhelds via the Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age edition. This re-release of the PS2 RPG includes similar features as many of the other Final Fantasy remasters, including upscaled graphics, a re-recorded soundtrack, and battlespeed modifiers, plus all the bonus content and gameplay changes from the PS2's International Edition that was left out of the US release--including the excellent new Job System that adds welcome variety to how you build your party. You can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age on Switch</a> for $25 (was $50). Both Final Fantasy X/X2 HD and Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age are being sold and shipped by Amazon, which we assume means Square Enix recently reprinted both games, since previously it was only available from third-party sellers. It's also surprising that both games are just $25, given that the eShop versions are $50 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XII is set in Ivalice, the fictional world created by the beloved spin-off, Final Fantasy Tactics, which recently saw its own high-quality remaster in the form of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. This version includes the option to play with the original PS1 graphics, or the newly remastered version with higher resolution graphics, voice-acted dialog, an overhauled UI, and other changes. The Switch version is available in a $50 Amazon-exclusive physical edition that includes the game and a bonus fold-out poster, as well as a free Switch 2 Upgrade.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Physical Final Fantasy Switch and Switch 2 Games</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-Collection-Anniversary-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DCKFWW1V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition (Switch)</a> -- $69 (<del>$75</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII &amp; Final Fantasy VIII Remastered: Twin Pack</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FVGG3TBR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy IX HD (Switch)</a> -- $40 | Releases December 9</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-X-2-HD-Remaster-Nintendo/dp/B07JB4ZR2Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy X / X-2 HD Remaster (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-XII-Zodiac-Age-Nintendo/dp/B07HCT37ZV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age (Switch)</a> -- $25 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASY-TACTICS-Chronicles-Exclusive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FBZYSJXM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Amazon Exclusive Edition (Switch)</a> -- $50 | Switch 2 upgrade included</li></ul><p dir="ltr">That leaves Final Fantasy XI Online, Final Fantasy XIV Online, the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy, Final Fantasy XV, and Final Fantasy XVI as the last numbered entries in the series not playable on Nintendo's handhelds. We wouldn't be surprised to see most of those show up on Switch 2 eventually (except for FFXI Online since it's a 20-year-old MMORPG that is only playable on PC these days)--though if you're looking to play a version of XV on Nintendo's handhelds, the Final Fantasy XV Mobile version--which is an episodic reimagining that heavily chops down the original PS4 open-world RPG and features a cartoonish art style--is available on the eShop. You'll also find other Final Fantasy spin-offs like World of Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles HD, and Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon on the eShop as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the Switch 2 still has some big Final Fantasy releases headed its way. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQXHSWXS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade</a> launches on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, and preorders are available for $50 at Amazon. Grabbing an early copy gets you a ton of bonuses, including a Magic The Gathering X Final Fantasy booster pack and a bunch of in-game content.

Square Enix has also confirmed that the second game, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and the as-yet-untitled final entry in the Remake trilogy will also come to Switch 2 in the future.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade Switch 2 Edition Preorders</h2><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lexar-512gb-and-1tb-microsd-express-for-switch-2-get-massive-discounts/1100-6530578/">Lexar 512GB And 1TB MicroSD Express For Switch 2 Get Massive Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-powera-cheap-wireless-controller-super-mario-amazon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Super Mario And Kirby Switch 2 Wireless Controllers For Up To 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-audible-premium-plus-sign-up-prime-big-deal-days-black-friday-holiday-2025-deal/1100-6524536/">Audible Premium Plus Holiday Deal: Get 3 Audiobooks For $3</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-big-deal-days-best-movie-deals-4k-blu-rays-available-now/1100-6535093/">Grab 4K Blu-Rays For Under $13: Inception, The Shining, Blade Runner, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X Preorders In Stock At Best Buy, Sold Out Everywhere Else (September 27)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-trading-cards-restock-where-to-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/2900-6271/">New Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Chocobo Bundle &amp; Scene Boxes Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-restocked-at-amazon-and-its-shipping-early/1100-6533358/">You Can Get The $60 Lego Game Boy Early From Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/history-of-middle-earth-5440-page-box-set-drops-to-all-time-best-price-for-big-deal-days/1100-6526926/">Complete History Of Middle-Earth Collector's Box Set Restocked With $170 Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>
