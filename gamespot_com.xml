                <p>GameStop has released its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings report</a>, shining a light on how the video game retailer is performing in the market--and it was a mixed quarter for the company.</p><p>Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections. Profit, however, soared from $17.4 million last year to $77.1 million for the latest period. GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price.</p><p>Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year.</p><p>GameStop achieved the lower SG&amp;A costs through a variety of means, including store closures and layoffs. GameStop closed 590 stores in the US in fiscal 2024 and the company said, "We anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025."</p><p>GameStop made the majority of its money for the quarter that ended on November 1 from hardware and accessories, reaching $367.4 million (down from $417.4 million). Software sales came in at $197.5 million (down from $271.8 million), while revenue from collectibles landed at $256.1 million (up from $171.1 million).</p><p>What's more, GameStop's Bitcoin holdings finished the quarter at $519.4 million. GameStop <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-just-bought-half-a-billion-worth-of-bitcoin/1100-6531856/" data-ref-id="1100-6531856">bought more than $510 million worth of Bitcoin in May 2025</a>, so the value has appreciated, but not by much. Bitcoin is highly volatile, after all. Bitcoin's value crashed from its all-time high price of more than $126,000 back in October 2025. Today, Bitcoin is trading at around $92,100.</p><p>GameStop was also in the news recently for its Trade Anything Day, where people could bring almost anything to a store to trade in for $5. People brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestops-trade-anything-day-included-dead-animals-and-can-of-whoop-ass/1100-6536757/" data-ref-id="1100-6536757">dead animals and a tiny Jesus.</a></p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 fans can now own a piece of tech that feels and looks like something you'd find at Kiroshi Opticals in Night City. To celebrate the game's fifth anniversary, CD Projekt Red partnered with Viture on limited-edition XR glasses themed around Cyberpunk 2077. The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Viture+Reveals+High-Tech+Cyberpunk+2077+Limited-Edition+XR+Glasses&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-10+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-10+01%3A55%3A42&amp;fnarticle_id=6536823&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.viture.com%2F%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fviture-luma-cyber-xr-glasses-cyberpunk-2077-anniversary-limited-edition%2F1100-6536823%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector's Edition XR Glasses</a> are numbered to 10,000 and available to purchase now for $549 on Viture's online storefront and at select major retailers.</p><p>Viture Luma Cyber XR Glasses combine the form factor of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Pro-Glasses-First-Ever/dp/B0FD8NP2DC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luma Pro ($499)</a> with the technical enhancements found in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Luma-Ultra-Gestures-Real-time/dp/B0FFT72CBX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luma Ultra ($599)</a>. Officially licensed collectible editions of tech and gaming products usually cost more than standard models, so it's pretty cool that the Luma Cyber XR Glasses cost $50 less than the Luma Ultra.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215"></a><figcaption>Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png"></figure><p>Designed by CD Projekt Red artists, the Luma Cyber XR Glasses feature the Kiroshi Opticals logo on the temples/arms as well as Night City-inspired symbols. The edges and temple tips glow neon yellow when the glasses are active. The black frames are translucent, which allows you to see some of the internal mechanisms and circuitry that powers Viture's high-tech extended reality glasses.</p><p>Viture launched its flagship Luma series in late August, so the Cyberpunk 2077-themed model utilizes the manufacturer's newest tech. The glasses create a private 152-inch virtual display for gaming, watching videos, and productivity. The Luma series uses Sony's latest Micro-OLED display panels and offer 1200p resolution with 120Hz refresh rate. The lenses are coated in electrochromic film to block out light and to prevent people around you from seeing your screen. The virtual display is crisp and bright whether you're outside in natural light or in a dark room.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219" data-ratio="0.486" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2077's signature shade of neon yellow is prominently featured.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, the Cyber XR edition has the lightweight form factor of the Luma Pro with the more advanced tech of the Luma Ultra. The enhanced features include an increase in peak brightness from 1,000 to 1,500 nits, hand gesture support, and 6DoF (Degrees of Freedom). The tracking sensors register head and body movements, which makes the Ultra and Cyber editions better equipped for augmented reality. The Luma Pro, for reference, is limited to head movements (3DoF).</p><p>The glasses can connect to just about any device with USB-C video out, but handheld gaming is the biggest draw for many users. Viture glasses work wonderfully with Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and other Windows handhelds. When connected to iOS, Android, macOS, or Windows devices, you can use Viture's free Spacewalker app to create three virtual displays. This is especially helpful if you plan on using the glasses for work as well as entertainment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262" data-ratio="0.41666666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro Mobile Dock is required for Switch 1/2 (sold separately).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png"></figure><hr><p>Viture XR Glasses are compatible with Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, but you'll need an extra accessory to act as the Switch 1/2 Dock Set.

The Pro Mobile Dock retail for $129, but it's still available for its $99 Black Friday price on Amazon.
