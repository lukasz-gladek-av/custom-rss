                <p>The Switch 2 is a fun console, but one of its shortcomings is that it's not the most ergonomic device for handheld play. That's where CRKD is looking to <em>switch </em>things up, as the company has announced the Nitro Deck 2 for Switch 2 consoles. Even better, it's compatible with the Switch 1 and is scheduled to launch in Spring 2026 in two colorways: White and Smoke Black. Pricing for these have not yet been revealed.</p><div title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5243" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">CRKD Nitro Deck 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">Releases Spring 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the original Nitro Deck, the Nitro Deck 2 is designed to be an all-in-one add-on to the Switch 2. The cradle uses a retractable locking mechanism to ensure a tight fit with Switch consoles, and it replaces the Joy-Cons on the sides. The built-in controllers are contoured to fit more naturally in your hands, and they feature an offset right thumbstick for a more ergonomic feel. The console tablet is now held in place with a retractable locking dial located on the rear. It also comes with a legacy adapter for Switch 1 and Switch OLED consoles, as well as another adapter to enable low-latency wired handheld play.</p><p>The capsticks on this model aren't Hall Effect sticks, but CRKD claims they can deliver ultra-responsive control, adjustable resistance, and immunity to magnetic interference thanks to a zero-contact design. Programmable back buttons can also be found on the rear of the Nitro Deck 2, which have been expanded to include L2 and R2 buttons. You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers. The cradle is rounded off with a durable metal kickstand and motion control compatibility.</p><p>When not in use with a Switch console, it can be used as a wireless or wired controller for PC, mobile devices, and smart TVs.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687"></a><figcaption>CRKD Nitro Deck 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking to get something right away for your Switch 1 console, the current <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/9A65AE84-0112-4BBA-8228-D36D2EDDC47A?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CRKD Nitro Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/570556D9-ED67-42E7-88BC-DD0885AF34EC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nitro Deck+</a> come highly recommended. These are priced from around $50 - $60 each, and they come in a wide variety of colors like black, PAL grey, and a retro-inspired purple. The regular Nitro Deck features full-size Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, motion controls, rumble, turbo function, curved handles, and is compatible with both the standard and OLED Switch models.</p><p>The Nitro Deck+ has a similar setup, but the key differences with this model include HDMI out support via the USB-C port so that you can put the Switch in docked mode without having to remove it from the cradle, a symmetrical thumbstick layout, an eject function to make removing the screen easier, and improved rumble effects.</p><h3>Nitro Deck</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DV5MY5R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuddle Team Leader: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $42.49 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG4WPDL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PAL Grey</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG44TGV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Pink</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0FQ5S7L7N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Purple</a> -- $43 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DHVN8GXX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League Silver Edition</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CGMGLHG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $60</li></ul><h3>Nitro Deck+</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2MDC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black )with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2J5HN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8ZR8WCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White (with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0DV5LL71D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Renegade Raider: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $47 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DHVW45YJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League: Gold Edition</a> -- $43 (<del>$55</del>)</li></ul><p>Several other third-party Switch 2 controllers are also on sale on Amazon right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The GameSir G8 Plus</a> features an extendable bridge that can cradle a Switch 2 and small tablets, and its traditional controller design makes it comfortable to use.
