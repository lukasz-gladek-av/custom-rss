Oddly enough, you're not actually catching these fish. These just mark the area where you'll be reeling in Pals and other in-game items.</p><p dir="ltr">You have the potential to catch both new and existing Pals in the game. To get started, you'll need a fishing rod and some bait. Then, head to the water and cast your line near a school of fish. A minigame will occur once a "fish" takes the bait. This game is similar to fishing in Stardew Valley, where you have a fishing meter and need to keep a green bar near the fish to successfully reel them in.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also catch even more Pals by building and placing fishing ponds inside your base. We'll cover details on the fishing ponds below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808"></a><figcaption>Fishing in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_fishing_rods">How to craft fishing rods</h2><p dir="ltr">There are various fishing rods that you can craft at various levels, and here we'll break down the requirements for each.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Beginner_Fishing_Set">Beginner Fishing Set</h3><p dir="ltr">Available at technology level 15, the beginner fishing set costs 2 points to unlock.

There are several bait types you can use: Simple Bait, High Quality Bait, Deluxe Bait, and Alluring Bait.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Simple_bait">Simple bait</h3><p dir="ltr">Simple Bait is unlocked when you purchase the beginner fishing set. This is the most basic bait type for fishing for Pals. This is a decent starting point for fishing, but it won't be very effective in luring Pals to bite.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Berries</li><li dir="ltr">2 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="High_Quality_Bait">High Quality Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">High Quality Bait is available at technology level 22, and it can be unlocked for 1 point. This bait lures in Pals, and it's improved quality to make catching them more readily.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Tomatoes</li><li dir="ltr">3 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deluxe_Bait">Deluxe Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">The Deluxe bait is available at technology level 38, and it can be unlocked for 2 points.

This bait has several benefits, as it lures in Pals, improves the minigame, and increases the number of items obtained from earning. This includes Pals and salvage items.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">1 Cavern Mushroom</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrots</li><li dir="ltr">5 Flour</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you've unlocked a bait type, it can then be crafted at the High Quality Workbench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810"></a><figcaption>Fishing pond at base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_fishing_ponds">How to use fishing ponds</h2><p dir="ltr">You can build fishing ponds at your base so your Pals can fish, too. You'll need to craft some bait to place here and assign a Pal to fish for you. Not every Pal can fish, but you should have quite a few options by the time you're high enough level to unlock them. You'll need to assign someone who can use their hands, which means you'll need a handiwork Pal like Anubis, Lyleen, or Katress.</p><p dir="ltr">These ponds have the potential to catch new and existing aquatic Pals, as well as in-game items such as gold and gems. These items can be collected from the cooler sitting next to your fishing Pal.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fishing_pond">Fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">The first Fishing Pond is found at technology level 31, and it can be unlocked for 3 points.</p><p dir="ltr">To build, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">40 Wood</li><li dir="ltr">5 Cement</li><li dir="ltr">10 Pal Fluids</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Large_fishing_pond">Large fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">This larger pond makes it possible to catch even larger Pals than the standard pond.

Just place an aquatic Pal in your party and make sure you've crafted a saddle for them. Use your fishing pole to reel in various items, such as Pal Souls, Gold, and gems.</p><p dir="ltr">Salvage spots in the sea are marked by floating bits of wood and barrels. You'll obviously need a fishing pole equipped, but bait isn't necessary. You simply need to interact with the floating junk to start a minigame.

The showcase is set to feature some of Capcom's biggest upcoming titles, including the recently announced Resident Evil Requiem.</p><p>Capcom has laid out the four games it plans to show, and while there is always a chance of a surprise, Capcom Spotlights don't usually feature any major new game announcements.

You can also watch the stream on GameSpot's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamespot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channel.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Capcom Spotlight start time</h2><p dir="ltr">The Capcom Spotlight starts at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET on Thursday. Capcom has said the livestream will last about 40 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the start times for different time zones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">8 AM (June 27)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">While there is always a small chance for surprises, Capcom has announced the four games that will be featured in the livestream. Those games are Monster Hunter Wilds, Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>, and now Capcom is planning to show off more of it during the stream. Some outlets, including GameSpot, got to see an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/">extended demo of Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which could be shown here to the public. It's also possible that Capcom has even more to show, since Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 26, 2026</p><p dir="ltr">Pragmata got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest along with a 2026 release window. GameSpot played a hands-on demo of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-juggling-gunplay-and-puzzles-gets-surprisingly-tense/1100-6532386/">puzzle-shooter</a> at Summer Games Fest, and it seems possible Capcom could show off more gameplay here. Considering Pragmata got its 2026 release window just a few weeks ago, it seems unlikely that a more specific date will be announced during the Capcom Spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/">overwhelmingly negative reviews</a> on Steam due to ongoing performance issues, will likely see announcements of new content updates, including potential upcoming events or new monsters. While there will most likely be a Monster Hunter Wilds expansion announced at some point in the future, it is probably too soon for that to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom recently announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-sagat-c-viper-and-two-more-characters/1100-6532220/" data-ref-id="1100-6532220">DLC fighters coming in Year 3</a> of Street Fighter 6--Sagat, C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex--but Sagat, the first character to be released, doesn't have a release date just yet. There will likely also be other updates, like new cosmetics and perhaps a showcase of the new fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">With the showcase running for about 40 minutes, it seems like there won't be much time for additional announcements. However, Capcom has unveiled a classic game collection or two at past showcases, so never say never.</p>

                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play.

He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise.

The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>
