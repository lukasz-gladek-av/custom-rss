Activision has announced that the stadium is opening up to become a new playable space.</p><p>Activision is also debuting a new mode, Stadium Resurgence. A 36-player mode, Stadium Resurgence is described as a "rapid action mode" where the skirmishes come fast on a smaller section of the overall map focused on the stadium itself. The mode debuts during the second full week of Season 5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540438" data-ratio="0.56381486676017" data-width="713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540438"></a><figcaption>The stadium is opening.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540438-screenshot2025-07-29at3.27.35pm.png"></figure><p>The publisher also teased something bigger for the stadium, saying a "massive disruption across Verdansk is imminent," along with an image of a red beam shooting down from the sky.</p><p>"Recon teams have confirmed the existence of a clandestine military base hidden within the sealed walls of the National Acropolis Arena. The extent of the threat remains unclear, though a weapon capable of large-scale destruction is expected to be unearthed within the vicinity," Activision said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540439" data-ratio="0.55894590846047" data-width="721" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540439"></a><figcaption>Something is going down in Warzone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540439-screenshot2025-07-29at2.40.23pm.png"></figure><p>Additionally, Warzone is getting a new contract called Satellite Hijack. For this contract, players must breach the stadium in the "most impressively explosive way possible." Activision's blog post about this contract contains redacted sections that suggests the contract has some narrative ramifications that Activision does not want people to know about ahead of time. One of the redacted sections pertains to an award that players and their squadmates will receive for completing the contract.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540437" data-ratio="0.50611246943765" data-width="1636" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4540437"></a><figcaption>Something mysterious is in store.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540437-screenshot2025-07-29at3.30.26pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond the changes to Warzone, the Season 5 update adds new maps, modes, guns, operators, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-blackcell-bundle-revealed-with-a-surprising-operator/1100-6533530/" data-ref-id="1100-6533530">BlackCell bundle</a>, and more.</p><p>Looking further ahead, the next entry in the Call of Duty series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a> and it's coming later this year.

Weber replied, "I'm like, 'Yeah, how are we going to do that?'"</p><p>Weber went on to tell <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/senior-the-witcher-4-dev-admits-hes-a-little-worried-about-making-an-rpg-better-than-the-witcher-3-but-he-knows-that-this-stuff-is-subjective-and-doesnt-see-video-games-as-mathematical/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that a video game, like any creative endeavor, is "subjective," so instead of trying to outdo The Witcher 3, the team is trying to do justice to The Witcher 3 by embracing the vibes of how the game was made. He said the studio wants to "take the philosophy we had during The Witcher 3--how to make a game, how to really care about these things, how to tell stories--and keep that philosophy."</p><p>The Witcher 4 is a "true sequel," so CD Projekt Red will also trying to answer "new questions." Otherwise, The Witcher 4 runs the risk of "just redoing what we did before," Weber said.</p><p>"I think it's really trying to have that healthy mix of really moving forward and also trying out some new things, but doing justice to what was there, not trying to beat it," he said.</p><p>Before this, Weber said when the team was making The Witcher 3, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-wants-studio-to-harness-the-scrappy-energy-that-made-witcher-3-so-successful/1100-6532438/" data-ref-id="1100-6532438">"good creative chaos"</a> going on at the studio. In practice, what this meant was that developers were working in a "vibe-based" manner and getting stuff done even if it was outside of their specific job remit.</p><p>"Sometimes I like to just say, 'Get it done. Do it dirty. Do it the way we used to do it!'" Weber said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027 at the soonest.</a> It's one of multiple games in development now at CD Projekt.
