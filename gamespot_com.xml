                <p>Washington-based studio Sucker Punch has received criticism in the past that they aren't well-equipped to create a game about the Japanese experience. The Sony-owned studio has recognized that criticism and detailed its research methods for depicting a fictional, historical Japan in an accurate way. The trip has even led to the addition of a game mechanic: vegetable foraging.</p><p>"Sucker Punch is an American company and we are well aware that we don’t naturally come equipped with the cultural knowledge to bring feudal Japan to life," wrote co-creative director Nate Fox in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/18/cultural-lessons-for-ghost-of-yotei/?sf277667361=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> about their research trip to Japan. "To do that, we need a lot of help. Thankfully we are also part of PlayStation, for Ghost of Tsushima we were fortunate enough to receive steady feedback from our colleagues in Tokyo. As you might have guessed, the same is true for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>. Only this time we’ve broadened our roster of advisers."</p>

      </div>
<p>Fox shared a photo gallery of the trip he and his team members took to Hokkaido--the second-largest island of Japan--and their efforts to better understand the culture they were trying to emulate with Ghost of Yotei. They met with an Ainu cultural advisor, travelled up a mountain, and foraged for vegetables.</p><p>"That night we resolved to put foraging into our new game," Fox wrote. "We wanted players to be able to share the experience we were lucky enough to have experienced."</p><p>Fox gave details on their visits to the Oshima Peninsula, Nibutani Ainu Museum, and Nikko Toshogu Shrine. Fox emphasized that while they hope to accurately depict parts of Japanese culture, their creation would be fictional.</p><p>"While our version of Hokkaido is fictional, the feeling of authenticity we strive to create has roots in those real world experiences," Fox wrote.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is coming to PlayStation 5 on October 2. In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/is-ghost-of-yotei-the-inverse-of-tsushima-trailer-breakdown/2300-6465229/" data-ref-id="2300-6465229">GameSpot's video</a> on how Atsu's story in Ghost of Yotei might be the opposite of Jin's In Ghost of Tsushima.</p>

                <p>The Onimusha franchise was created in a very different era for gaming, decades before open-world titles and souls-like games were all the rage. Next year, Capcom will revisit the franchise with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gets-new-gameplay-look/1100-6532203/" data-ref-id="1100-6532203">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, and the game's director, Satoru Nihei, wants fans to know that he and his team won't be embracing those modern trends in the new title.</p><p>"Onimusha: Way of The Sword isn't an open-world game, and it certainly isn't a punishing die-and-retry (souls-like) game either," Nihei told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-not-a-soulslike-and-not-open-world-director-says-instead-it-expands-on-what-the-series-is-known-for/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>. "While there's no doubt seasoned action-game players will be able to enjoy it, our goal was to make a game which gamers who don't consider action games their forte will also have fun playing. In Way of The Sword, our main focus was to express the clashing of blades through the action."</p><p>Nihel went on to explain that Way of the Sword is incorporating new mechanics to make the sword fights feel more realistic. Deflecting allows players to deplete the stamina of bosses, which will eventually allow characters to trigger a Break Issen attack and destroy part of the boss. Nihel also confirmed that the soul-absorption ability will be retained in the new game.</p><p>Producer Akihito Kadowaki recently told GameSpot that Way of the Sword is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/way-of-the-sword-is-not-connected-to-previous-onimusha-games-or-the-netflix-series/1100-6532389/" data-ref-id="1100-6532389">completely unconnected to any of the previous Onimusha games</a>. Instead, players will assume control of Miyamoto Mushashi, a samurai warrior whose likeness is based on the late actor Toshiro Mifune.</p><p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will hit PS5, Xbox Series X❘S, and PC in 2026.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete God of War Timeline Explained!</p>
      </div>
<p>When first reported, this latest entry in the God of War franchise was described as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/greek-god-of-war-side-story-releasing-this-year-report/1100-6530298/" data-ref-id="1100-6530298">side-story that would take the series back to Greece</a> and that it would release this year. Just before Sony's State of Play, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a> suggested that the game was smaller in scope than previously thought, while adopting a metroidvania format in 2D, with Grubb seemingly confirming he had heard the same. This would make this new God of War the latest in a trend of established franchises dabbling with the format after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> released to critical acclaim last year.</p><p>Sony has yet to give any official indication it's working on a God of War spin-off or any other follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, which Sony Santa Monica has said concluded the Norse Mythology saga. The studio has not revealed what it has been working on since its release either.</p>

                <p>The original Final Fantasy Tactics was a sleeper hit as it was in the shadow of Final Fantasy 7 and the coming Final Fantasy 8. It helped redefine what a tactical RPG should look like and function, and will be getting a complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics/">remaster later this year</a>. However, the original game could have looked a lot different if not for art director Hiroshi Minagawa insisting it run at 60fps.</p><p>Having already put his stamp on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together--the game many fans consider FFT's tonal predecessor--he wanted to improve the visuals even with the technical constraints of its era.</p>

<p>"At first, we wanted something closer to Tactics Ogre in terms of map size and character count. But no matter what we tried, the framerate dropped to 30fps," he said, while talking to the Japanese gaming site, <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250617t/2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Denfaminicogamer</a> (translated via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-was-built-around-one-non-negotiable-requirement-60-fps/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Automaton Media</a>). He mentioned how he became obsessed with sticking to 60fps, especially after seeing Tobal No.1 playing incredibly smooth at 60fps.</p><p>Minagawa continued, saying he wanted to try to understand why the PlayStation's specs don't allow for that many polygons, but keep it at 60. Working backwards from there, the team took into account things like the size of the map and a design that avoids rounded corners as much as possible. Also, taking Tactics Ogre's party size from 10 and lowering it to five for FFT.</p><p>"Having 10-character parties like in Tactics Ogre felt like too much. Final Fantasy games at the time had parties of four or five, so we figured FFT should be an extension of that. And that just so happened to align perfectly with Minagawa’s framerate concerns," FFT director Yasumi Matsuno added. "[Final Fantasy Tactics] was a game that could only have been made at that time, on that hardware. Even if we tried to recreate it today, there's no way it would turn out the same."</p><p>Turn-based games such as FFT and Tactics Ogre are usually focused more on the gameplay and customization aspects of your party and less on the actual visual graphics.</p><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will be released on September 30 for PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>The developer behind the partially community-funded PC game Alzara: Radiant Echoes has announced it's shutting down and the game won't be released after the team raised more than $300,000 to make it.</p><p>Studio Camelia, which successfully raised €294,428 ($339,000 USD) from more than 5,000 people to fund the game via Kickstarter, made the announcement in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>"We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this," the studio said.</p><p>Studio Camelia will not refund money to people who contributed to the Kickstarter. "Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that," it said, adding that Kickstarter campaigns are inherently risky and are advertised as such.</p><p><a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005048173-Does-Kickstarter-issue-refunds#:~:text=Kickstarter%20is%20not%20a%20store,go%20along%20for%20the%20ride." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter says</a> people who pledge funds to a project should know beforehand that, "Kickstarter is not a store and we do not issue refunds. When you back a project, you're supporting a creator's right to try to make something new--and agreeing to go along for the ride."</p><h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2><p>The team wrote in a statement that it wanted to build a JRPG with a "fresh perspective," and one that was influenced by games like Final Fantasy X and Golden Sun. The company was funded in part by the Kickstarter campaign, along with money from staffers' own personal savings, along with "business angels, banks, and institutions." The game was also accepted into Microsoft's Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>However, all of this only covered half of what Studio Camelia said it needed to produce Alzara. So it decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to demonstrate to potential investors that Alzara had legs. The team then sought funding from an "industry partner," but it was ultimately unable to secure one.</p><p>"Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk," the statement said.</p><p>Studio Camelia attended Tokyo Game Show, DICE, and other industry events to meet with partners about raising funding, but "none of them resulted in a contract."</p><p>"We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could," the developer said. "This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn't be more true."</p><p>Alzara is now "on an indefinite pause" as the studio undergoes the liquidation process that requires "various legal procedures" that will run for "some time."</p><p>"There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!" the studio said.</p><h2><strong>Pre-production demo footage</strong></h2><p>While Alzara may never be released, Studio Camelia released pre-production demo footage of the game, showing it in its non-finished state. The studio said it cannot release the demo itself due to copyright reasons and issues pertaining to the liquidation process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLV5dIfrX4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLV5dIfrX4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Plenty of games enter development and are never released. The creative process, after all, is a fickle business. Blizzard, for example, says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about half of the games it begins development on.</a> Warner Bros., meanwhile, is reported to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">spent $100 million on a new Wonder Woman game before cancelling it. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is a great-looking game, leveraging the ray tracing enhancements that the latest iteration of iDTech affords the blood-soaked shooter. But if you're on PC, then you can unlock the true potential of the engine with the awaited path tracing update, at the expense of a lot of performance.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">path tracing</a> is an all-encompassing form of ray tracing, which simulates how rays of light bounce off surfaces, that is far more demanding. Objects shoot out more rays and allow those rays to bounce around a scene more than once, leading to far more accurate lighting, better ambient occlusion, and better reflections and surface material approximations. It is, when implemented correctly, a night-and-day difference to standard ray tracing techniques, albeit only afforded by some of the best hardware on the market.</p><p>Path tracing can be transformative in Doom: The Dark Ages, if you find the right scene to do some comparisons, and it's interior spaces seem to benefit the most. Light bounces and illuminates objects in ways that standard ray tracing can't afford, while the contrast between the areas where light is meant to be, and where it definitely shouldn't, are more naturally defined. Digital Foundry has released an extensive look at many of the improvements path tracing affords, which gives you a good idea if the additional visual flair is worth it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR3c9lyV5as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BR3c9lyV5as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's because you'll need to give up a lot of performance to take advantage of path tracing, even if you restrict which game objects make use of it. You'll be making heavy use of Nvidia's DLSS or frame generation to keep the action feeling smooth, with <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/i-tested-the-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-the-difference-is-night-and-day-but-my-gpu-got-hotter-than-hell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Guide</a> stating that performance plummeted by 40% on the RTX 5070Ti used for testing. Your mileage may vary depending on what GPU you're using, but just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> before it, this isn't a setting you can just turn on and forget about.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is another great entry in the modern reinvention of the series, continuing from the strong foundations established with 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, while taking the action in a wholly new direction. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, we praised this new direction saying, "Doom: The Dark Ages shows that there's still so much fertile ground that this series can explore, and that sometimes smart, measured changes can take the series in surprising new directions and yield some of its finest moments."</p>

                <p>MindsEye just received its second hotfix update, as developer Build a Rocket Boy slowly chips away at fixing the issues with what is currently the worst-reviewed game of the year.</p><p>When it launched on June 10, it quickly became clear that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/" data-ref-id="1100-6532343">MindsEye had a myriad of issues</a>. In addition to its dated game design, MindsEye struggles to maintain a stable frame rate and is plagued by many gameplay and visual glitches. This hubbub around this caused Sony to allow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-players-say-theyre-getting-mindseye-refunds/1100-6532383/" data-ref-id="1100-6532383">refunds of the game on PS5</a> and developer Build a Rocket Boy to promise it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-outlines-what-its-doing-to-try-to-fix-the-game/1100-6532388/" data-ref-id="1100-6532388">working on fixes for the game</a>.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros. Discover boss JB Perrette. In a statement, Perrette said the company is making these changes to "develop long-term franchise roadmaps" for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC projects.</p><p>"We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises," Perrette said.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Variety</a>, this management shakeup did not lead to any layoffs or any executives leaving the company. Former WB Games top boss David Haddad left the company earlier this year, and it remains to be seen if the company is looking for a replacement.</p><p>Earlier this month, WB Discovery said it is breaking apart into two companies: WBD Streaming and Studios and WBD Global Networks. WB Games is part of the Streaming and Studios division, which is run by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>In terms of upcoming releases, Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad launched earlier this year and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-of-thrones-rts-revealed-for-pc/1100-6532166/" data-ref-id="1100-6532166">new Game of Thrones RTS is coming in 2026.</a></p><p>One WB game that is not going forward is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">new Wonder Woman game that the company spent a reported $100 million on before cancelling. </a></p>
