                <p>The cooking game Overcooked is getting adapted into a competition reality series for Netflix, according to a new report. The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported.</a></p><p>The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the report said.</p><p>The series is said to be in the "early stages" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.</p><p>Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. </p><p>A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.</p><p>The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix.

This quest sends you to the Dam Battlegrounds to collect a water sample--but if you don't know where to do so, it can be a bit confusing to figure out. We'll reduce the frustration for you a bit by explaining how to get the water sample.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete this quest, so feel free to jump in with a free loadout if you prefer. This will ensure that you won't lose anything important if you happen to run into trouble while exploring the Dam Battlegrounds.</p><p>When you're ready to set off, here's how to complete Water Troubles.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_Flood_Access_Tunnel">Where to find the Flood Access Tunnel</h2><p>The first step of Water Troubles requires you to find the Flood Access Tunnel. This is located in the Red Lakes area on the right side of the map.

It can be a lot of fun to track things down on your own, but it can also prove challenging at times. If you're struggling to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest, we'll help you along with things.</p><p>Note that you need to extract from the topside with Major Aiva's Patch once you obtain it. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bring along an augment with a safe pocket so that you can ensure you don't lose your quest item even if you fall in battle.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, read on for where to find Major Aiva's Patch in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest</h2><p>Your first objective for Echoes of Victory Ridge will be to actually find Victory Ridge, which is located in the northern portion of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Zoom in and seek the West Broken Bridge POI--that's where you're headed. Note that this is a mostly safe area in the majority of matches, but you never know if you might run into other questers, so keep an eye out and try to be friendly. Or shoot them on site--it's your call.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275" data-ratio="0.55354993983153" data-width="1662" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275"></a><figcaption>West Broken Bridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the circled area above, you'll need to look for a small box containing Major Aiva's Patch. This can be hard to spot if you don't know where to search. Look around for part of the fallen road that can be crawled under--more easily spotted if standing on the northern end of the POI and looking south. Under the right side of this crumbled road is the box with Major Aiva's Patch inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277"></a><figcaption>Major Aiva's Patch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg"></figure><p>Place Major Aiva's Patch in your safe pocket if you came equipped with one, then head east to the North Complex Elevator to extract. There are often a lot of ARC patrolling here, so retreat to safety after calling the elevator if you get their attention and can't fight your way out of it. Hopefully, you'll get back to Speranza and turn this quest in so you can move along to the next one.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Once you pick up the mementos, you can toss it in that safe pocket and take it home with you even if you end up dead before you can extract.</p><p>With that out of the way, let's find Major Aiva's Mementos and wrap up The Major's Footlocker quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva’s Mementos for The Major's Footlocker quest</h2><p>Major Aiva's Mementos can be found in an apartment building located at the Ruby Residence POI. This area is located in the northwestern section of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138" data-ratio="0.58616404308202" data-width="2414" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597138"></a><figcaption>Ruby Residence</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597138-arcraiders_20251105131903.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the apartment complex, you'll want to head into the leftmost building. The item you're looking for is on the top floor (not the roof). Head up two flights of stairs, then wrap around and follow the rooms until you reach a dead end with a window and a box on a desk in the corner.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597053-arcraiders_20251105132200.jpg"></figure><p>This box contains Major Aiva's Mementos. You'll need to interact with it, then pick up the item and store it in your inventory.</p><p>As stated above, you're required to extract with this item. Hopefully, you have a safe pocket slot! Either way, your closest options are likely to be the Central Swamp Lift to the south or the North Complex Elevator to the east. The safer choice is probably the latter, as the former tends to stay pretty busy with other players perusing the swamp for mushrooms and other quests. Whichever you choose, play things safe and get out alive, raider.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>Early Black Friday deals are slowly trickling in, including a limited-time offer on NordVPN. The VPN company is offering its several of its <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">subscription plans for up to 77% off</a>, with an additional 3 months tacked on for even better value</strong>. Using a VPN is a good way to buff up your privacy capabilities and maintain access to region-locked content while traveling. If you've been on the fence, NordVPN's discounted prices make now a great time to consider a subscription.</p><p>NordVPN is offering all 24-month and 12-month versions of its Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime subscription tiers at significant discounts, with an additional three months included. That's 15 total months of VPN service for far less than you'd normally pay.</p><p>The 24-month Prime plan offers the best value. It includes full access to the VPN, plus additional incentives such as 1TB of cloud storage, advanced identity protection, and the NordProtect service, which has a robust suite of insurance, Dark Web monitoring, and credit freeze assistance options. The 24-month Prime plan normally costs $836.73, but with the discount, new subscribers can sign up for just $186. That's a whopping $650 savings, and it includes the bonus three months, for a total of 27 months.</p><p>If you're looking for something in the short term, the 12-month plans are also discounted, and each one includes the three extra months. For example, the 12-month Prime subscription includes everything in the 24-month plan, but instead costs $127.35 (normally $464.85/year), and you're getting 15 months at that price thanks to the bonus three months.</p><p>We've included a quick breakdown of NordVPN's discounted plans below, and you can browse the full details of the deal at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NordVPN%27s+Black+Friday+Deals+Will+Save+you+Hundreds+Of+Dollars&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-11-05+10%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-05+12%3A07%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6535963&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fnordvpn.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F417838%2F7452%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fnordvpn.com%252Foffer%252Fpricing%252F%253Ftag%253Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnordvpns-black-friday-deals-2025%2F1100-6535963%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NordVPN's website</a>. NordVPN lists the monthly cost of its plans, but the 2-Year plans are actually billed every 24 months, and the 1-Year plans are billed annually, so you'll pay the full price for the subscription period upfront when you sign up. NordVPN also offers monthly plans, but these are not eligible for the Black Friday deal. It's also important to note that your subscription will revert to the standard price after the promotional period ends, unless you cancel or update your plan before the end of the promotional period.</p><h2>NordVPN Black Friday Deals</h2><h4>2-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $80.73 (<del>$313</del>)</li><li>Plus 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $105 (<del>$404.73</del>)</li><li>Complete 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $132 (<del>$493.83</del>)</li><li>Prime 24-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $186 (<del>$836.73</del>)</li></ul><h4>1-Year Plans</h4><ul><li>Basic 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months --$68.85 (<del>$173.85</del>)</li><li>Plus 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $82.35 (<del>$224.85</del>)</li><li>Complete 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $97.35 (<del>$274.35</del>)</li><li>Prime 12-Month Plan + 3 Extra Months -- $127.35 (<del>$464.85</del>)</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box/1100-6535705/">Adorable New Astro Bot Collectibles Are Waiting To Be Rescued By You</a></li>   </ul> </div>

The list of new accolade challenges includes:</p><ul><li>Climb past the Roots</li><li>Climb past the Roots without ever having more than 25% spores</li><li>Escape a spider's web and survive</li><li>Cure yourself from a zombie bite</li><li>Try all 5 types of Shroomberry in a single expedition</li><li>Pull an unconscious friend 30m with the Rescue Claw</li><li>Block 100 total damage with the Fortified Milk</li><li>Eat 3 hot dogs in 5 seconds or less</li><li>Resurrect friend using unholy means</li><li>Bounce up to 40m off a mushroom</li><li>Cook and eat a Mandrake</li></ul><p>As you can see, the new update brings plenty more to do while climbing. Achievement hunters who previously collected all badges will now have even more challenges with the Roots update.</p><p>This new update has players flocking back to Peak. Landfall's breakout cooperative multiplayer game currently has more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3527290/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">50,000 players</a> trying to climb through the new Roots biome. While that’s not quite close to its 170,000-player peak, it’s still a hefty number of players.</p>
