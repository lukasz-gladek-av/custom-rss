                <p>Nintendo has added a new batch of classic games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Three more Sega Genesis titles are now available to play through the service: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/streets-of-rage-1991/" data-ref-id="5000-3191">Streets of Rage</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-thunder-blade/" data-ref-id="5000-16439">Super Thunder Blade</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/eswat-city-under-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-8653">ESWAT: City Under Siege</a>.</p><p>The Sega Genesis classics library is available exclusively as part of Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan. This premium tier includes all of the benefits of the base Switch Online service, as well as access to classic Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance games, plus select DLC such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' Happy Home Paradise expansion.</p><p>The base Nintendo Switch Online plan costs $20 per year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 per year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Nintendo routinely expands Switch Online's offerings with new features and titles. Back in February, the company added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-nintendos-weirder-games-is-coming-to-switch-online-this-month/1100-6529318/" data-ref-id="1100-6529318">Wario Land 4</a> to the Game Boy Advance library, while Game Boy classics Donkey Kong '94 and Mario's Picross were added in March.</p><p>The service will continue to expand on Switch 2. In addition to the current array of classic titles, Expansion Pack members will also have access to GameCube games on the new console. Three titles (The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur II, and F-Zero GX) will initially be available at launch, with other classics like Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance slated to follow in the future.</p><p>Switch Online members will also be able to take advantage of one of Switch 2's major new features: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">GameChat</a>, which allows players to easily talk with friends and share their screen while playing together in group sessions. All Switch 2 owners will be able to try GameChat for free through March 2026, after which it will only be accessible with a Switch Online membership.</p>

                <p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 have seemingly revealed that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/mafia-the-old-country-launches-august-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, 2K and Hangar 13 posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam blog post</a> detailing their plans for PAX East 2025.
