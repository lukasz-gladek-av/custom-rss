                <p dir="ltr">Dungeons &amp; Dragons has spawned numerous fictional settings for players to explore, but one of the biggest and most detailed is Dragonlance. The high-fantasy world, known as Krynn, was crafted by authors Laura and Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis, but rather than just serving as a campaign setting for dungeon masters and players to explore, Weis and Tracy Hickman further developed the universe into a sprawling series of novels, expanding Dragonlance's popularity beyond just D&amp;D players, and cementing it as one of the more prolific fantasy settings ever conceived. If you've ever wanted to get into the series, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fworld-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-26-dragonlance-novels-for-just-18-this-month%2F1100-6530195%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble's new The World Of Dragonlance Book Bundle</a></strong> includes up to 26 Dragonlance novels for $18.</p><p dir="ltr">Like all Humble Bundles, this is a pay-what-you-want deal where the more you pay, the more books you get. A portion of revenue is donated to charity--in this case, Room to Read, which helps children in low income communities learn reading, literacy, and life skills. You can also increase your pledge if you want to contribute more to charity, and the bundle's store page includes a slider so you can adjust the revenue split between Humble, Wizards of the Coast, and Room to Read.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the books you get, the base $1 tier includes three books: Dragons of a Fallen Sun, Dragons of Lost Star, and Dragons of a Vanished Moon. These novels were written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, the co-authors of the original Dragonlance series, and comprise the War of Souls trilogy. Like other Dragonlance arcs, the War of Souls Trilogy can be read as a standalone series, making this $1 bundle a great introduction to the fantasy setting.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to expand your collection further, the $10 seven total ebooks, including the War of Souls trilogy, plus The Soulforge, Brothers in Arms, Amber And Iron, and Amber And Blood. The best deal, however, is the $18 tier, which gets you a whopping 26 Dragonlance novels in ebook format, including the original Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy. That equates to a $207 value. You can see the full list of included novels on the bundle's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fworld-dragonlance-wizards-coast-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-26-dragonlance-novels-for-just-18-this-month%2F1100-6530195%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Store page</a>.

                <p>Game Informer, the games journalism institution that began in 1991 and ran for 33 years before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">shut down by parent company GameStop in August 2024</a>, may be making a comeback.</p><p dir="ltr">The previously silent social channels for the magazine and website sparked to life on March 19, all <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfkhVo9-a2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing a video</a> that shows something happening to what was once Game Informer's "The Final Level: Farewell" letter before teasing a March 25, 2025 date.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfkhVo9-a2s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="14">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vfkhVo9-a2s?start=14" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Many former Game Informer editors who worked at the magazine when it was shuttered, including <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marcusstewart7.bsky.social/post/3lkql5bkvi22v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marcus Stewart</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kylehilliard.bsky.social/post/3lkql2i4qmc2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kyle Hilliard</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brian Shea</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/itsvanaken.bsky.social/post/3lkql3y3b422o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alex Van Aken</a> and others, all shared "Continue? Yes or No" images on social media that prominently feature Game Informer magazines in the background.</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say for sure without more details, but it certainly appears that Game Informer is coming back to life, possibly free from GameStop corporate ownership. Many former Game Informer editors and writers (I interned there in 2014) have gone on to write for other websites or appear on gaming-related podcasts, while those who still reside in Minneapolis, Minnesota (where Game Informer was based) frequently make appearances or are recurring guests on <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MinnMax</a>, a Patreon-funded video game podcast created by former Game Informer video producer Ben Hanson.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer's sudden and relatively unceremonious closure in August 2024 came as a shock to many in the industry. The move came just a few months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-now-offering-standalone-subscriptions/1100-6522173/" data-ref-id="1100-6522173">Game Informer began offering standalone magazine subscriptions</a> not tied to GameStop's PowerUp Rewards program.</p><p dir="ltr">The magazine's "The Final Level" letter posted to social media was not penned by Game Informer staff, prompting the magazine's editor-in-chief, Matt Miller, to pen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-editor-in-chief-says-goodbye-after-gamestop-deletes-previous-message/1100-6525613/" data-ref-id="1100-6525613">proper goodbye after a previous farewell message had been taken down by GameStop</a>. Hilliard, a former GameSpot editor who was Game Informer's content director at the time, said the shutdown was so sudden that the team wasn't even allowed to finish the magazine's upcoming next issue, despite it being over 70% complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Informer's final issue turned out to be June 2024's issue #367 featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-ref-id="5000-490222">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> on the cover. Whether or not Game Informer's resurrection also means a return to a print magazine is still unknown, but fans of the brand can expect more news soon.</p>

the holy two-handed sword Ashbringer. It will be the first time WoW Classic players will be able to get their hands on a non-corrupted version of the weapon, despite players back in the vanilla WoW days tirelessly trying to discover a way to no avail. However, players of the modern "retail" version of WoW were able to use Ashbringer as part of the game's 2016 Legion expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">How, exactly, players will purify the Corrupted Ashbringer and restore it to its former glory is still under wraps, but the datamining sleuths at <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/how-this-legendary-weapon-may-be-coming-to-season-of-discovery-in-phase-8-375915" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a> have some theories. If you don't want spoilers, stop reading now! Based on datamines, in typical WoW Classic fashion, the quest to restore Ashbringer looks like it will be a globe-trotting affair. The quest may even take players to previously unseen areas in WoW Classic like Mount Hyjal and the Well of Eternity.</p><p dir="ltr">Wowhead has also <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/possible-bosses-coming-in-the-scarlet-enclave-raid-season-of-discovery-phase-8-375982" rel="nofollow ">datamined</a> possible bosses for the Scarlet Enclave raid, and one of them will be a very familiar face to longtime WoW players. Spoilers if you don't want the contents of the raid revealed, but it looks like players will face off against none other than Lillian Voss. In modern WoW, Voss is a prominent undead character who first appeared in the game's Cataclysm expansion, where she infiltrated the Scarlet Crusade in a quest of revenge against those who wronged her.</p><p dir="ltr">Before she was turned undead, she was a fanatical member of the Scarlet Crusade, but her exact backstory, or the manner of her death, has never been revealed. Just as was the case when players believed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-think-the-war-within-big-bad-is-secretly-in-season-of-discovery-too/1100-6520312/" data-ref-id="1100-6520312">Season of Discovery included appearances from WoW: The War Within's main villain Xal'atath</a>, it looks like Blizzard is once again tying together its two eras of WoW in an exciting way.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the raid's final boss, that also looks to be a familiar face--the dreadlord Balnazzar. Previously seen in the game's Stratholme dungeon posing as a member of the Scarlet Crusade, it looks like he has now attempted a full-blown coup, and it will be up to players to dethrone him once and for all.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be next for WoW Classic Season of Discovery is still unknown, but Blizzard has said the experimental seasonal servers will continue to exist in some form even after new content is no longer in development. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW: The War Within just received its goblin-themed Season 2 update</a>, as Blizzard continues to share more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">details on the MMORPG's highly anticipated player housing system</a>.</p>

The Creative Studio won't let you do any of the simulation part of the game, but it <em>will</em> let you dabble with inZoi's character creation and build mode.</p><p>There's a little bit of a catch, though. For the first few days--March 20-23--you'll need to unlock access via streaming drop on Twitch or Chzzk, which will require you to link your Krafton account and watch an inZoi stream for 15 minutes, or on Steam itself. Steam will be the easiest option--you just have to watch a livestream from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inZoi's product page</a> for 30 minutes, and a key for the Creative Studio will be granted without remembering any additional logins.</p><p>There are only a limited number of keys that can be obtained from drops, but if they run out you won't have to wait too long. Starting March 23, the inZoi Creative Studio will become available for anyone on Steam to download for free. And you'll probably appreciate having the chance to go wild on character creation ahead of the release of the rest of the game, since inZoi features a rather intense level of customization built in--you can literally design your own clothing items from scratch, for one thing. It's a lot to absorb even without thinking about the simulation part.</p><p>On Tuesday night, Krafton hosted a very lengthy streaming showcase that went deep on everything inZoi will have to offer at launch, plus the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/" data-ref-id="1100-6530201">game's roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025, and you can check that out below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi launches in early access starting March 27 on Steam for $40. Krafton has said that until inZoi reaches its full 1.0 launch, all updates will be included in that price--so no paid DLC for this one for a while.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developers at GSC Game World have been through a lot, to put it mildly. Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-stalker-2s-developers-persevered-as-russians-invasion-of-ukraine-began/1100-6529870/" data-ref-id="1100-6529870">full-scale Russian invasion in 2022</a>, roughly 200 developers opted to relocate to Prague in the Czech Republic, continuing to collaborate with their colleagues in Kyiv. This, in theory, should have led to a more peaceful development process for this group, but a large fire in the Prague office threw another unexpected wrench in its plans.</p><p dir="ltr">The fire, which broke out in late 2023 in the Prague office's server room, partially wiped out one of the floors. No one was hurt, but post-accident images of the damage show scorch marks and ash covering the ground. GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych seems to view the situation as a sort of blessing in disguise, as he explained to us in the latest GameSpot Insider documentary.</p><p dir="ltr">"It actually made us stronger because we got to experience what can happen, how it may look--what we have to do to not let it happen again," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KSH5O1KLSI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KSH5O1KLSI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There was certainly a material cost to the accident, though. In addition to the server on the floor being destroyed, developers' work computers were also destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one more challenge to rebuild this game again," lead community manager Yevhen Bazarov said. "One more thing we weren't expecting."</p><p dir="ltr">While he's able to laugh about it now, lead cinematic artist Ingwar Dovgoteles was working on a cinematic-department documentation job that took roughly three days. He had finished it late the night of the fire. About 15 minutes after he got home, he got a call from the office that everything he had worked on was gone.</p><p dir="ltr">"All my work was there," Dovgoteles added. "[Done] in three days with all this documentation. It was just wasted."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for GSC Game World, despite yet another setback, Stalker 2 did eventually release in late 2024, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">best games of 2024</a>.
