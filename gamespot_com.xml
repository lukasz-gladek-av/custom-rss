                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from. Thus far, Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment haven't announced how many copies Avowed has sold since its release on February 18. The game received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-companions-wont-nag-you-as-much-about-getting-better-armor-after-day-one-patch/1100-6529570/" data-ref-id="1100-6529570">a day-one patch earlier this week</a> to address some of the issues found in it. The developers have previously explained why Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but fortunately there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>.</p><p>Avowed is available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, and subscribers to those services <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">have an option to upgrade to the premium version</a> at a greatly reduced cost.</p>

Players vie for the $38 million prize--metaphorically that is--by competing in up to six mini-games like Tug of War, Glass Bridge, Marbles, and Red Light/ Green Light. Designed for up to six people to play, the first person to reach the Squid Head will win big in this twisted take on survival of the fittest. Like the Squid Game TV series, surviving players will get to split the money earned up to that point, so it's in your best interest to keep your teammates alive so that you have a numerical edge over the opposing team.</p><p>Each session lasts around 45 minutes, so this is a nice way to enjoy a quick round of Squid Game and not worry about being possibly betrayed by a trusted friend. Each of the six games features unique playstyles and rulesets, so you'll want to adapt quickly if you want to avoid being eliminated.</p><p>In addition to the official board game, Netflix also collaborated with Spin Master Games on an official set of marbles.

                <p>Following its recent launch, the mobile Epic Games Store is continuing to roll out free games on Android worldwide and iOS in the European Union. Two new arrivals are particularly good ones worth picking up.</p><p>From now until March 20, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Knights of the Old Republic II are available for free through the mobile version of the Epic Games Store. Both were console heavy hitters 20 years ago and defined what a Star Wars RPG would look and feel like. Characters like Darth Revan and Bastilla Shan have been fan favorites ever since, with the latter coming close to actual canonization. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlIO0CDEobo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NlIO0CDEobo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Last month, the Epic Games Store added nearly 20 third-party games. There will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p>For years, Epic Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/" data-ref-id="1100-6513515">has fought with Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">Google</a> in court for the right to expand the Epic Games Store on mobile. The company says that it grew Epic cross-platform accounts to 898 million users during 2024--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-store-sales-on-pc-reached-1-billion-in-2024/1100-6529505/" data-ref-id="1100-6529505">an increase of 94 million people</a>--and this stat includes accounts created through partner platforms and the Epic Games Store. Epic is following in the footsteps of its PC store by trying to attract users with free games.</p><p>Recently, two members of Epic's board of directors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-justice-department-investigation-leads-to-board-members-leaving-epic-games/1100-6528567/" data-ref-id="1100-6528567">were forced to step down</a> by the US Justice Department because they were already members of Tencent's board, which the government considers a rival gaming company. Epic is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">suing an alleged cheater</a> whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has released a <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Switch OLED bundle</a> featuring one of the console's best exclusive games: Super Mario Bros. Wonder. The bundle costs $350--the same price as the Switch OLED on its own--so you're essentially getting a digital copy of Nintendo's superb side-scrolling platformer for free. Mario Wonder still regularly sells for its full $60 MSRP. As an added bonus, the bundle also comes with a 3-month Switch Online individual membership ($8 value).</p><p>The <a href="https://howl.link/209n9tvq0d4jz?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17400843503014?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros. Wonder Switch OLED bundle</a> is available now at Best Buy. We expect other major retailers, with the exception of Amazon, to stock the bundle soon.</p><p>Nintendo typically only releases new Switch console variants or bundles during the holidays and alongside big game launches--such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Hyrule-Edition-with-Bonus-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Expansion-Pack%2F9822067437%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder%2F1100-6529632%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom-themed Switch Lite</a> that launched last year. But with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2 slated to launch later this year</a>, it makes sense that Nintendo would bundle the Switch with Mario Wonder to help move existing units.</p><p>If you're new to the Switch platform, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is as good of a first game as any. The 2023 platformer offers an imaginative spin on the classic Super Mario side-scroller formula. It introduces multiple new gameplay features, including Mario's Elephant power-up and Wonder Flowers, which dynamically alter your surroundings in fun and creative ways. It earned a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-a-badge-of-honor/1900-6418136/" data-ref-id="1900-6418136">Super Mario Bros. Wonder review</a>.</p><p>Mario Wonder is just one of many great Switch exclusives Nintendo has released over the past eight years.

                <p>There's a famous line in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings where Gandalf the Grey explains that a wizard is never late or early. Instead, "he arrives precisely when he means to." Video games, on the other hand, are another matter. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/" data-ref-id="5000-604117">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a> has been delayed again.</p><p>The game's developers, Private Division and Wētā Workshop, jointly announced that Tales of the Shire will now be released on July 29. Prior to that, Tales of the Shire was delayed from its 2024 release window and was scheduled to land on March 25. Now, fans will just have to wait until summer to move into the virtual Shire.</p><p>In the statement below, the given reason for the delay is that the devs want to ensure "the same cozy experience" is available on all platforms. The note also states that the developers want the game "to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318" data-ratio="1" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447318"></a><figcaption>The complete message from Tales of the Shire developers Private Division and Wētā Workshop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4447318-talesoftheshirenote.jpg"></figure><p>There will be no epic quests or ring-tossing into Mount Doom in this game. Tales of the Shire is all about the tranquil lives of Hobbits when they aren't out saving the world or having adventures. Truthfully, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins--as well Sam, Pippin, and Merry--were always outliers among their people. Most of the Hobbits prefer to stay at home in the Shire.</p><p>This game will allow players to create their own Hobbit character, and put together a beautiful home for them. Players can also enjoy simple Hobbit tasks like farming, gardening, decorating, and trading for rare items with fellow residents of the Shire.</p><p>Tales of the Shire will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC . GameSpot had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tales-of-the-shire-has-a-long-ways-to-go-if-it-wants-to-be-precious/1100-6526616/" data-ref-id="1100-6526616">a hands-on preview for Tales of the Shire</a> last year, which called it "charming" and praised its "good fundamentals," while also stressing the need for several quality-of-life improvements and more compelling gameplay. Hopefully the final version of the game will deliver those adjustments.</p>
