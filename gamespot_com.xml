                <p>Nintendo has revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis-fever/" data-ref-id="5000-694771">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, a new installment in the sports series coming exclusively to Switch 2. Announced at today's Nintendo Direct, the game is set to launch February 12, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The big new feature for Mario Tennis Fever is found in the name--Fever rackets. These special rackets have a Fever gauge that can be built up to "unleash a Fever shot," like blasting the court with fire or ice. Another example is the Mini Mushroom racket, which will litter your opponent's side of the court with the item that can shrink them down. Nintendo noted that there are 30 Fever rackets in all, each with a special ability.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Tennis Fever will also offer 38 playable characters--the most ever for the franchise, according to Nintendo. Most of the familiar faces are here, such as Yoshi and Donkey Kong, and Nintendo didn't seem to showcase any new characters in the game's first trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be an Adventure mode for Mario Tennis Fever, as Mario and company are turned into babies. That means they will need to relearn how to play tennis through an overworld, minigames, and boss battles. Other modes detailed by Nintendo include Tournament, Trial Towers, Mix It Up, Online Room, and Online Ranked.</p><p dir="ltr">The last game in the sports series was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-477088">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, which was released on Switch in 2018. The franchise began in 2000 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-tennis/" data-ref-id="5000-2715">Mario Tennis</a> on Nintendo 64.
