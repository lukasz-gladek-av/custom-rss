                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a> actor Ashly Burch, who plays main character Aloy across Guerrilla Games' sci-fi franchise, is speaking up in the wake of a leaked video showing an AI-powered Aloy.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, the since-removed video showed an internal tech demo in which Sony Interactive Entertainment's director of software engineering Sharwin Raghoebardajal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">held a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy</a>. Raghoebardajal said in the video the AI Aloy was a prototype designed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate what could be possible with the technology.</p><p dir="ltr">Burch took to TikTok over the weekend to say she had seen the leaked video and that Guerrilla Games had reached out to let her know that the AI tech demo did not use any of Burch's performance data (voice and motion capture) and was not a project that was in active development. But that didn't change the fact that Burch said the video made her worried, not about Guerrilla, Aloy, or her career specifically, but about game performance as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel worried about game performance as an art form," Burch said.</p><p dir="ltr">She went on to outline why the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), of which she is a member, is currently on strike</a> as they seek protections and compensation for the use of AI in games based on an actor's likeness or performance.</p><p dir="ltr">“I feel worried not because the technology exists," Burch said. "Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections--anyway to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised."</p><p dir="ltr">Burch went on to say that she was not trying to call out any game company, or Guerrilla, specifically in her video and said the technology in and of itself is not the problem. Instead, she said the problem is that bargaining groups involved in the strike won't agree to "common-sense protections" that would help to protect the longevity of game performance as a career.</p><p dir="ltr">"I believe we deserve to be protected," Burch said.</p><p dir="ltr">Burch's comments come as AI becomes an increasingly hot topic in the game industry. In December 2024, Activision confirmed it had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies cast</a> amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. Meanwhile, some game companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy Entertainment have issued statements to clarify their stance on AI</a>, with Remedy specifically stating it would not use it to replace creative jobs or actors.</p>

                <p>Developer Silent Games and publisher Secret Mode have announced that its upcoming single-player action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/empyreal/" data-ref-id="5000-651867">Empyreal</a> will be released on May 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. On a distant world where humanity has discovered a strange monolith built by a lost civilization, players will explore this location while mastering various weapons and RPG systems.</p><p>In a developer diary, creative director Joseph Rogers went into more detail on the game, describing it as a third-person game about "transcendental revelations" that players will discover as they venture deeper into the monolith. Thematically, Empyreal asks questions about the human condition, its place in the cosmos, and whether societal systems like duty and honor are still driving forces in humanity's story.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gRQlppV4vM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to gameplay, Empyreal combines action-RPG systems with elements inspired by isometric-ARPG games like Diablo. Similarly to games in this genre, you'll be free to invest in various skills, but you can only have a handful of them available to use at any given time, so you will need to mix and match the abilities to suit your playstyle.</p><p>This works with three distinct weapon types that drastically change combat, as there'll be a big emphasis on constantly fine-tuning your character throughout your journey. Silent Games added that Empyreal will also offer an endgame experience with a substantial amount of content, as well as a New Game Plus mode with features exclusive to a fresh run.</p><p>Other interesting parts of the game include cartograms that can shake up a level and help you chase after specific loot, and there's also the option to be charitable toward fellow players. Defeating certain bosses will result in a rip in the fabric of reality, and if you feel like donating some gear, you can send something through this tear to another player.</p><p>Any item sent through will significantly increase its stats, but this is purely a gesture of goodwill as you'll get nothing from it. "It's really up to the community as a whole to make it work," Rogers explained. "I'm quite curious to see how or even if players engage with this feature."</p><p>Empyreal will be the first title launched by Secret Mode as an independent publisher, following its sale from Sumo Group to Emona Capital earlier this month.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell's first major post-Activision project was the PlayStation-partnered Deviation Games, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-partnered-studio-from-ex-cod-devs-has-closed/1100-6521774/" data-ref-id="1100-6521774">opened and closed without even announcing or releasing a game</a>. Now Blundell is starting a new company with PlayStation.</p><p>Blundell said in an interview with Jeff Gerstmann that he's starting Dark Outlaw Games, which is a new studio inside of PlayStation Studios. "We've been working away in the shadows for a while. When we've got something to talk about we'll step out into the light," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-has-formed-new-studio-dark-outlaw-games-with-call-of-duty-zombies-lead-jason-blundell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LY37_Cenui4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Blundell said it's "such a privilege" to be the newest first-party PlayStation studio. "Sony doesn't start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling," he said.</p><p>As mentioned, this isn't Blundell's first go-around with Sony. In 2021, Deviation Games signed a partnership with Sony to create a new IP that would exclusive to PlayStation. Another Call of Duty veteran, Dave Anthony, founded Deviation with Blundell. However, Blundell left the company in 2022, with a round of layoffs following in 2023, before the company closed its doors for good in 2024 without its first game ever even being announced.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Dark Outlaw is making for Sony. As for Blundell, he was instrumental in the creation of Call of Duty's massively popular Zombies mode during his time at Treyarch. He worked on a number of Call of Duty games over the years, and he directed 2015's Black Ops 3.</p>
