                <p>A movie based on EA's The Sims is in the works, with Oscar-winner Margot Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, attached. Prolific Hollywood producer Roy Lee is involved as well, and now he's shared some further insight into what fans can expect from the video game movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-lego-movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Lee said he expects the movie to be "unique." He said it's similar to The Lego Movie, in that when it was announced, people wondered how it would translate to the big screen. People didn't understand until they saw it, Lee said, and a similar thing could happen for The Sims movie.</p><p>Lee produced The Lego Movie as well, along with Robbie's blockbuster hit Barbie. "[Audiences] were probably wondering, 'What could a Barbie movie be?' Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.</p><p>There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie. Some may recall that plans were first unveiled to make a Sims movie back in 2007 at Fox, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/28/sim-ply-unfilmable-inside-the-sims-movie-that-never-was" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it didn't come together for a variety of reasons.</a></p><p>The Sims movie is in production for Amazon MGM Studios, with Kate Herron (Loki) attached to direct and co-write with Briony Redman (Doctor Who).

                <p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has announced that the game will leave early access and launch its 1.0 version in 2026. Additionally, the studio teased that while the bulk of the team is working on updates, improvements, and more content for Palworld, the company also has smaller teams at work on new games.</p><h2><strong>Cleanup</strong></h2><p>Palworld 1.0 isn't launching sooner because Pocketpair is spending time now working on "cleanup" for the existing game.</p><p>"Beyond just adding new content, there is a lot of clean up that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game," the developer said. "We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>ðŸ“¢About Palworld Ver. 1.0</p><p>Hello everyone.<br>Palworld will officially release (Ver. 1.0) in 2026.</p><p>We are currently developing a massive amount of content for this milestone, and also planning some surprises for the rest of 2025.</p><p>Please watch the video below for more details: <a href="https://t.co/rpP5gmLtjs" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/rpP5gmLtjs</a></p></div>  â€” Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1967755319418724713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Pocketpair will remain mostly quiet for the remainder of 2025 as these efforts are underway, the studio said, while also cautioning fans that the Winter 2025 update won't be as big as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-palworld-update-feybreak-is-arriving-on-december-23/1100-6528456/" data-ref-id="1100-6528456">Feybreak update in December 2024.</a></p><p>The studio went on to say that it has a "few surprises" planned for the Winter 2025 update for Palworld and that people should know that Pocketpair is "not slowing down or scaling back--quite the opposite."</p><h2><strong>Palworld 1.0</strong></h2><p>For the 1.0 release of Palworld, Pocketpair said fans can expect a "truly massive amount of content," and it's going to take time to get it all ready for release.</p><p>"Rather than rushing it, we believe that laying the right foundation now will lead to a better game in the end," the developer said, adding that it will reveal sneak peeks at some of the 1.0 content relatively soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20current%20state,closer%20to%20the%20official%20release.%E2%80%9D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Palworld Steam early access FAQ</a> states that the price of the game might increase before 1.0. Right now, Palworld is discounted from $30 to $22.50, a deal that runs through September 22.</p><h2>New games</h2><p>Pocketpair's biggest and best-known game is, of course, Palworld, and the company plans to continue to grow and evolve the game over time. Simultaneously, the studio is plotting what may come next.</p><p>"As the company grows, we continue to experiment with other ideas for games," the developer said. There are "several smaller teams" inside Pocketpair working on new game ideas that "hopefully" turn into read products, the developer said, adding that more information about these efforts will come soon.</p><p>This is separate from Pocketpair's new Pocketpair Publishing division that seeks to help fund and market games from other studios.</p><h2><strong>Palworld history</strong></h2><p>Palworld launched in January 2024 for Xbox and PC, quickly becoming a massive hit, thanks in part to its inclusion with Xbox Game Pass. The game was a fast success, reaching millions of sales and installs, but the launch was marred with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-plagiarism-accusations-palworld-ceo-asks-people-to-stop-harassing-devs/1100-6520522/" data-ref-id="1100-6520522">controversy over plagiarism claims and other concerns.</a> The game bears a striking resemblance to Pokemon, and The Pokemon Company and Nintendo teamed up to sue Pocketpair, not for copyright infringement as some expected, but rather patent infringement claims.</p><p>Pocketpair subsequently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Poke Balls--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><p>Palworld later launched on PS5 in September 2024 and came to Mac in March 2025. Pocketpair would also go on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">partner with Sony for Palworld merch.</a></p>

                <p>KPop Demon Hunters, the hit animated film from Sony Pictures, is reportedly making its way into Fortnite, according to well-known leakers SpushFNBR and Loolo. The film, which combines KPop stardom with supernatural action, follows a fictional girl group called Huntr/x--idols by day, demon slayers by night. With songs performed by real-world KPop artists, the movie quickly became a cultural phenomenon, dominating music charts and becoming the most-watched original film in Netflix history.</p><p>While Epic Games has yet to confirm the crossover, the most likely additions to the game could be new dance emotes based on the film's choreographed musical numbers. Maybe even throw in some of The Saja Boys' Soda Pop routine, as it went viral over the summer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922" data-ratio="0.41875" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568922"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Netflix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4568922-kpopdemonhunters_prores422hq_sdr_2ch_20250424.01_04_39_22.jpg"></figure><p>Character skins based on the three members of Huntr/x are also a strong possibility. In the film, Rumi, Zoey, and Mira all have distinctive fashion and stylized weapons. Fortnite could easily include their fits from the introductory number "Done, Done, Done" to their more detailed outfits like they had in "Golden" (see above).</p><p>This potential collaboration would add KPop Demon Hunters to Fortnite's growing list of music-related crossovers. Previous collaborations have included in-game concerts and cosmetics featuring artists like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sabrina-carpenter-is-inspiring-fortnite-players-to-dance-not-fight/1100-6530729/" data-ref-id="1100-6530729">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, Ariana Grande, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-will-exclusively-debut-the-weeknds-new-popular-music-video/1100-6521121/" data-ref-id="1100-6521121">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bts-concert-kicks-off-in-fortnite-tonight/1100-6482420/" data-ref-id="1100-6482420">KPop group BTS</a>. Given the global success of the film and the ongoing popularity of KPop--and the mega success of the movie--this crossover could become one of Fortnite's most popular music-themed events yet.</p>
