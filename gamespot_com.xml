                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive got into the publishing game with its IOI Partners program, and MindsEye--from former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy--was the company's first published game. The game struggled mightily out of the gate, with many criticizing its technical performance, among other things. Now, IO's CEO, Hakan Abrak, has reacted to the launch and discussed whether or not the company will continue to publish others' games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Abrak told IGN</a> that when IO was first chatting with Build a Rocket Boy, the idea was to find a way to "support them," because IO believed in the company's "great ideas." IO was coming in to help Build a Rocket Boy--a brand-new game developer with no releases under its belt before MindsEye--distribute the game.</p><p>For whatever reason, MindsEye had issues, and Abrak addressed this frankly. "Well, that was definitely tough, right?" he said. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners."</p><p>Abrak went on to say that Build a Rocket Boy is now "working hard on turning that around" to help regain trust. He added that he believes the team has "tons of potential."</p><p>MindsEye just got its <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1963898695214039479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth major update this week</a>, and it's a big one, weighing in at as much as 15GB. It fixes bugs and makes performance improvements. A fifth major patch is coming next.</p><p>But will IO continue to publish games via its IOI Partners program? Abrak wasn't ready to confirm anything one way or another. He said IO will publish its own games, including the upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>. But future partnerships? "That remains to be seen," Abrak said.</p><p>007 First Light was the focus of a special PlayStation State of Play broadcast this week, during which IO announced the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/" data-ref-id="1100-6534459">release date</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">showed off new gameplay</a>, and revealed a $300 collector's edition featuring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">replica Golden Gun.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone mentioned in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that he might need to retreat to a cabin in the woods to focus on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier. That sentiment rings true now more than ever, as Barone juggles multiple projects--including the newly announced Stardew Valley 1.7 update and a surprise voice cameo in Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/stardew-valleys-eric-barone-is-in-the-hollow-knight-silksong-credits-for-voicing-a-mystery-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> caught Barone's name appearing in the credits of Silksong, listed alongside members of Team Cherry and even the family of lead designer William Pellen. Given the shared success of Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight, which launched within a year of each other and became landmark indie titles, it's no surprise their creators have formed connections within the indie development scene.</p><p>His role in Silksong involved providing non-verbal character sounds--for those familiar, Nintendo-style chirps and mutterings--for one of the game's new NPCs. While Barone hasn't revealed which character he voiced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> confirmed it was indeed him. Fans are now left to guess which bug-like denizen of the kingdom of Parloom bears his signature tones.</p><p>Despite this side contribution, Barone remains fully focused on Haunted Chocolatier. Even though the 1.7 update for Stardew Valley may slow development slightly, Barone insists the impact will be minimal. As for his voice work in Silksong, it was a small and likely long-completed task and more a fun detour than a distraction.</p>

The new poll once again offers three options that players can pick between--hireable drivers, shrooms, and fishing.</p><p>One of the poll options, shrooms, was originally offered in the first community poll, only to be defeated by the rival cartel. If shrooms is victorious this time, it will add a brand-new psychadelic drug type for players to offer to their customer base.</p><p>Hirable drivers, the most functional of the new options, offers players the ability to hire drivers who can transport items between your various properties, businesses, and dealers. This new feature will also come with a quality of life update to the existing delivery system.</p><p>The last new option is a video game classic--a fishing minigame. If players vote to add fishing to Schedule 1, they'll be able to catch fish, with the potential to reel in other special items too. Fishing will act as an extra revenue stream for players who get into it, with the fish you catch able to be sold at Randy's Bait &amp; Tackle store for profit. The update will also add some new ingredients and effects to play with.</p><p>Voting is available to everyone who owns the game, and can be accessed in-game from the main menu. Voting is only open until this coming weekend, and the results will be visible in game after voting closes.</p><p>The last time Schedule 1 creator Tyler held a community vote, the most popular feature was the rival cartel with 64% of the vote. The feature is now live in the game as of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-update-adds-rival-cartel-wars/1100-6534328/" data-ref-id="1100-6534328">latest major update</a>, offering new mid-late game content for dedicated Schedule 1 players.</p><p>Schedule 1 is a popular Steam title themed around building a drug-selling empire. The game is still in early access for now, and is being developed by a solo developer--though Tyler has said he may hire more developers to work on Schedule 1 team soon.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>One Ubisoft developer has explained why Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 will rely on Game Key Cards instead of standard cartridges, citing technical limitations of the console’s physical media.</p><p>Responding to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> on BlueSky, audio architect for the Snowdrop Engine at Ubisoft Rob Bantin explained that the game "relies heavily on disk-streaming for its open-world environments" and that Switch 2 cartridges simply did not give the performance needed for the game to hit its quality target. "I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bantin wrote</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game Key Cards have already stirred controversy among Nintendo fans, as they serve as a download-key holder rather than containing the full game on the cart. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">While they can be resold and aren’t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws looks like a respectable third-party game on the Switch 2, as gameplay footage of it so far has shown off a consistent 30fps performance. While it's naturally not as good-looking as the PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S versions, the fact that Ubisoft has managed to get the game running generally well on the Switch 2 bodes well for the system and potential upcoming releases from the company. In comparison, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">Elden Ring's Switch 2 performance isn't great at all</a>, according to reports.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launched for Switch 2 on September 4, a year after it was first released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game includes both of its DLC expansions--Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune--but the game might be a one-off considering that it wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/">Company CEO Yves Guillemot recently blamed the Star Wars brand</a> being in "choppy waters" as one of the reasons why the game didn't reach Ubisoft's sales expectations, although its worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">reviewers and fans criticized the game</a> for its badly paced intro mission and various technical issues when it first launched.</p><p>Most of these issues have been addressed since then, and the post-launch expansions have been well-received.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
