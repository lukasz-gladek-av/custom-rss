                <p>As pleasant as it might be for us if the world were exclusively full of nice people, that's not necessarily the right formula for an entertaining life sim video game. If all the characters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> only gave each other compliments, it would get boring immediately--fortunately, that's not what InZoi is like at all. Here's a full explainer of how InZoi karma works.</p><h2 id="InZoi_karma_explained">InZoi karma explained</h2><p dir="ltr">In InZoi, you can be a good Zoi or a bad Zoi, and your behavior is reflected by your karma level. InZoi's karma is not something that has a direct parallel in The Sims 4--the closest mechanic would be its reputation system, but that's based on what other characters think of you, and this karma system is more like the game's judgment of your behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">With that being the case, it's best to think of InZoi's karma as akin to a dark side/light side meter in a Star Wars game, or the renegade/paragon system from Mass Effect. The more your karma slides one way or the other, the more options you'll have to do things that correspond with your alignment. If you have bad karma, you'll unlock new methods for being a jerk, like picking fights and shoving people to the ground for no reason. You'll even be able to start committing crimes, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">robbing ATMs</a>. You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">go to jail for that kind of thing</a>, though, so be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side of that, having good karma will unlock a bunch of new friendly and encouraging interactions that will get other Zois to like you more.</p><p dir="ltr">While there's not any sort of immediate inherent consequence to having bad karma--it doesn't give you horns or anything like in Fable--there <em>is</em> a spiritual one. If your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-death-the-afterlife-and-ghosts-explained/1100-6530456/" data-ref-id="1100-6530456">Zoi has terrible karma when they die, they'll be forced to become a ghost</a> who roams around the world dealing with unfinished business. Unfortunately, the ghost mechanics haven't actually been added to the game yet, so we don't know how those will actually work.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_good_or_bad_karma_in_InZoi">How to get good or bad karma in InZoi</h2><p dir="ltr">So now you know what karma does, but we haven't discussed how you actually gain or lose it. In the abstract, obviously, the idea is mean-spirited  interactions with other Zois will make your karma worse, and nice interactions will make it better. But, more specifically, there is a section of the dialogue and interaction box in InZoi dedicated entirely to actions that will mess with your karma. It looks like this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526" data-ratio="0.56246759979264" data-width="1929" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526"></a><figcaption>Choose interactions with the circular karma symbol if you want to increase or decrease your karma.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That little circular icon on those options on the right side of the image is InZoi's mark for karma, with a <strong>blue circle marking a good karma action, and a red circle marking a bad karma action</strong>. To make your karma go up, do the blue actions as much as you can. To make your karma go down, do the red actions. It's exactly that simple.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two ways you can boost the process a bit, however. The first is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-inzoi-donuts-and-what-they-do/1100-6530400/" data-ref-id="1100-6530400">with donuts</a>. There are a pair of karma-focused donuts you can buy using the coins you earn for achieving your life ambitions, one which resets your karma to neutral, and one that gives you very bad karma. There's no donut for getting good karma, though--you'll have to do that the hard way.</p><p dir="ltr">The second boost you can give your karma gains is in the city management menu, which has sliders that allow you to globally increase, or decrease, the rate at which all Zois' karma goes up and down. If you set that slider to the fast end, you can have your karma maxed out (or min'd out) in minutes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_there_any_benefit_to_having_neutral_karma_in_InZoi_">Is there any benefit to having neutral karma in InZoi?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not that I can tell, but as you can tell by the ghost thing, this system isn't all fully fleshed out yet. It's likely that neutral options will be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">For much more on your new life in Krafton's life sim, don't miss our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-guides-hub/1100-6530475/" data-ref-id="1100-6530475">InZoi guides hub</a>.</p>
