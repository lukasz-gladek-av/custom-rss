                <p>Battlefield 6 players believe they have discovered evidence that the game features AI-generated art. People are theorizing that some of the art in player emblems in Battlefield 6 was created, at least in part, with the use of generative AI systems, though there is no concrete evidence of this as of yet or any comment from Electronic Arts or the game's developers.</p><p>People have pointed out some apparent irregularities with the art below. GameSpot has contacted EA in an attempt to get more details on the situation.</p><p>Back in October, DICE GM Rebecka Coutaz said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">EA's teams use generative AI in the early stages of development</a> "to allow more time and more space to be creative." But Battlefield 6 has no gen AI-created content, she said. She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p>Developer Fasahat "Fas" Salim said people should not be afraid of generative AI in game development, adding that plans were underway to determine how to best implement the technology into future development pipelines.</p><p>"It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows; how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level," he said.</p><p>Coutaz has also said using generative AI for making games is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">"very seducing."</a></p><p>To hear EA developers speak enthusiastically about AI is no big surprise, as the company's other key executives, including CEO Andrew Wilson, have said the tools will help EA in the long run. Wilson has said further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">will lead to job losses, but it will ultimately create more jobs than it displaces over time.</a></p><p>Before this, EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Outside of EA, Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a></p><p>The developers working on Battlefield rival Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">freely admit to using generative AI to aid in the development process.</a></p><p>The debate around AI in games was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">reignited recently with Larian boss Swen Vincke's controversial comments.</a> Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-of-the-year-award-stripped-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-over-ai/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">had one of its Game of the Year awards revoked due to AI.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 is 2025's best-selling game of the year so far in the US, even outperforming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>

                <p>In the span of a week, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was named Game of the Year by both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-watch-the-indie-game-awards-2025-and-all-the-award-nominees/1100-6536993/" data-ref-id="1100-6536993">The Indie Game Awards</a>. But just two days after its latest win, The Indie Game Awards stripped Expedition 33 of its two wins over the developer's use of AI.</p><p>"The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself," reads a statement on <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Indie Game Awards' official site</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination."</p><p>Following that decision, The Indie Game Awards named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a> as its new Game of the Year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sorry-were-closed/" data-ref-id="5000-540223">Sorry We're Closed</a> was given the award for Debut Game, which Expedition 33 previously claimed.</p><p>During a feature run on <a href="https://english.elpais.com/culture/2025-07-19/the-low-cost-creative-revolution-how-technology-is-making-art-accessible-to-everyone.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">El Pais</a> in July 2025, Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse said, "We use some AI, but not much. The key is that we were very clear about what we wanted to do." Following the release of that article, Sandfall Interactive released the following statement:</p><p>"The studio states that it was in contact with El Pais on April 25--three months prior to this publication. During these exchanges, Sandfall Interactive indicated that it had used a limited number of pre-existing assets, notably 3D assets sourced from the Unreal Engine Marketplace. None of these assets were created using artificial intelligence."</p><p>Additionally, Sandfall states that the only AI-created assets in the game were placed as "temporary placeholder textures" that were missed during Expedition 33's QA process. Once the assets were identified, they were "removed within five days" and replaced by the intended textures.</p><p>So far, the controversy doesn't seem to have dimmed Expedition 33's popularity. The President of France, Emmanuel Macron, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/president-of-france-takes-a-turn-congratulating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/1100-6536961/" data-ref-id="1100-6536961">congratulated Sandfall</a> for its success at The Game Awards. Those awards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-gave-clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-massive-boost/1100-6536980/" data-ref-id="1100-6536980">gave Expedition 33 a massive boost</a> on Steam and consoles. That increase may have also been fueled in part by a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-celebrates-its-game-awards-blowout-with-a-major-new-update/1100-6536925/" data-ref-id="1100-6536925">new DLC for Expedition 33</a> that dropped immediately after The Game Awards.</p>

                <p>Amid Netflix's proposed buyout of Warner Bros. Discovery, the streaming platform has made another big business move, acquiring a gaming startup amid the company's push further into games.</p><p>Netflix has paid an unspecified sum for Estonia-based Ready Player Me, a company that builds the technology used to create gaming assets that are available across different titles.</p><p>"Our vision has always been to enable avatars and identities to travel across many games and virtual worlds. We've been on an independent path to make that vision a reality for a long time. I'm now very excited for the Ready Player Me team to join Netflix to scale our tech and expertise to a global audience and contribute to the exciting vision Netflix has for gaming," <a href="https://x.com/timmutoke/status/2002068554888389049" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CEO Timmu Tõke said</a>.</p><p>Netflix confirmed to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/12/19/netflix-acquires-gaming-avatar-maker-ready-player-me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TechCrunch </a>that Ready Player Me's team of 20 people will join Netflix, but only one of the executives, CTO Rainer Selvet, is shifting to Netflix. There continue to be many unknowns about the deal, too, like when gaming avatars will come to Netflix or which titles will be supported.</p><p>As a result of the buyout, Ready Player Me also <a href="https://readyplayer.me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will close its own services on January 31, 2026, and this includes the company's avatar-maker tool, PlayerZero.</p><p>Ready Player Me sells products and services to developers for avatars that work across multiple different titles. The company points out in its business plan that every game is different, including game engines, devices, and art styles, and it sells the tools that developers can use to handle compatibility in these environments. Ready Player Me counts companies like Ubisoft, Lenovo, and Nvidia among its clients.</p><p>Netflix has always said its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-raising-prices-again-as-it-discusses-vision-for-video-games/1100-6528932/" data-ref-id="1100-6528932">investments in gaming were experimental in nature</a>, as the company looked to find what worked best. This has led to a rocky road, as Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">cut back on its AAA game plans</a> and is now focusing more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-releases-lineup-of-games-you-can-play-on-your-tv/1100-6536210/" data-ref-id="1100-6536210">mobile and party-focused games</a>. In July, Netflix announced it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">"ramp up" its gaming efforts</a>.</p><p>Netflix recently announced a blockbuster deal to acquire Warner Bros.

      </div>
<p>Studio co-founder Jeremy Stieglitz revealed a two-year roadmap for Ark: Survival Ascended, which will culminate with the release of Legacy of Santiago, a major expansion that will lay the groundwork for Ark 2 and introduce several new gameplay mechanics coming to the sequel.</p><p>Snail Games also confirmed that 4 million copies of Ark: Survival Ascended have been sold in the two years since it first launched for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>First announced in 2020, Ark 2 was originally scheduled to launch in 2023, but it was delayed to 2024. After missing that date, the studio has largely kept quiet about progress on the game. Vin Diesel is aiding development on the game--and starring in it--under the fancy role of "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vin-diesel-will-not-only-star-in-ark-2-hes-also-an-executive-producer/1100-6485514/">president of creative convergence</a>" at Studio Wildcard.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-animated-series-with-impressive-voice-cast-gets-surprise-release-out-now/1100-6522008/">The game has also been adapted into an animated series</a> that debuted last year without much fanfare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ark-the-animated-series-part-2-finally-gets-a-release-window/1100-6536005/">and the second part of Ark: The Animated Series</a> will arrive in 2026.</p>
