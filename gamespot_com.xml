                <p>After launching in South Korea, China, and Taiwan back in April 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x/" data-ref-id="5000-584986">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> finally has a worldwide release date. The Persona 5 spin-off hits PC and mobile devices on June 26, 2025, and brings with it even more of the series' stylish turn-based combat and an entirely new cast of Phantom Thieves.</p><p>Developed as a collaboration between Atlus' P-Studio and Chinese developer Black Wing Games, Persona 5: The Phantom X is a mobile-focused title that sends players back to the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-5/" data-ref-id="5000-115534">Persona 5</a>, albeit as a new character and under slightly different circumstances. In it, players control Wonder, a second-year high school student at Kokatsu Academy whose worldview is shifted upon meeting a mysterious owl-like creature named Lufel. After some good old-fashioned exposition, the duo eventually set off on quest to recruit a new cast of Phantom Thieves, their ultimate goal being to restore the concept of desire back to humanity and put a stop to the mysterious force hellbent on taking it away.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5btk2fzbRjQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5btk2fzbRjQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What ensues is a continuously-expanding, live-service adventure filled with much of the same turn-based combat, social simulation, and time management elements found in mainline Persona titles. Players will get the chance to explore new dungeons and areas of Mementos, take on part-time jobs and join after-school clubs, strengthen their Personas, raise Wonder's social stats, and form relationships all while experiencing an original story. Players can also expect fan-favorite Persona characters--like Joker, Ann, Ryuji, and the rest of the original Phantom Thieves--to make appearances in the game via special contracts. Lastly, the Phantom X also introduces new elements to the series, including the PvE-focused Velvet Trials, mini-games, and the ability to create and join Guilds.</p><p>Since its release in select regions last year, the title has earned a lot of praise for its story and new cast of characters, with players stating that both are shockingly on par with those found in the Persona 5. This could certainly have something to do with Persona veterans--like series producer Kazuhisa Wada, composer Ryota Kozuka, and artist Shigenori Soejima--being involved in the game's development.</p><p>However, it's important to note that the upcoming title has gacha elements, similar to games like Genshin Impact or Wuthering Waves. Though you don't <em>have </em>to spend money in order to play through The Phantom X, players are often encouraged to, which can definitely be a barrier when it comes to fully enjoying the game.</p><p>Persona 5: The Phantom X will launch on mobile and PC worldwide on June 26. For a closer look at the upcoming title, we've included screenshots and a few pieces of the game's key art below.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4494724,1300-4494725,1300-4494726,1300-4494727,1300-4494728,1300-4494729,1300-4494730,1300-4494731,1300-4494732,1300-4494733" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494724-gallery6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494725-about_img3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494726-%EA%B3%B5%EB%9E%B5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494727-persona-5-the-phantom-x-screenshot-type4-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494728-about_img2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494729-gallery1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494730-gallery2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494731-gallery3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494732-gallery4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4494733-gallery5.jpg"></figure>

                <p>Back in September, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">its commitment to fixing the gameplay issues</a> that plagued <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a> since its launch. Today, the game's second DLC story, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-big-star-wars-outlaws-surprise-has-been-spoiled-by-a-leak/1100-6530948/" data-ref-id="1100-6530948">A Pirates Fortune</a>, is launching alongside a new Star Wars Outlaws patch that's adding a few more improvements.</p><p>Ubisoft shared the details about the new patch <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/6xjEjWMQplZquUcRmLrKco/swo-patch-update-16" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Star Wars Outlaws' official site</a>. Some of the most notable changes involve Kay's newfound ability to smoothly switch from her blaster to two-handed weapons. Kay has also gained the ability to free-fire while riding her speeder. New space contracts have also been added for all players that feature multiple challenge types for additional rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Urp3XfddqZs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Urp3XfddqZs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Some of the latest changes are essentially cleaning up problems, like audio lines playing out of order or certain props disappearing or floating in the air during cutscenes. A handful of other fixes were introduced to keep players from being unable to complete intel quests and to prevent Kay from getting trapped in a room on Toshara while respawning.</p><p>Today's patch also features new cosmetic items based on the Star Wars: Skeleton Crew TV series, including an outfit for Nix. Those items are available to all players and can be found on the Trailblazer in Kay's delivery crate.</p><p>The full patch notes are below. Beware of spoilers when the notes start mentioning specific missions.</p><p><strong>Highlights</strong></p><ul><li>Added the ability to free fire Kay's blaster while riding the speeder</li><li>Added the ability to holster and swap between two handed weapons and Kay's blaster</li><li>Added the ability to equip new passive systems to the Trailblazer for additional gameplay effects</li><li>Added new space contracts for all players that include multiple challenge types</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Hidden Riches intel could not be completed</li></ul><p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>Improved shooting when behind cover to prevent hitting the environment</li><li>Fixed an issue where certain intel quests could not be completed if intel was found before picking up the quest</li><li>Improved enemy AI when moving to cover/being suppressed</li><li>Fixed an issue where Kay could get trapped when respawning in a restricted room on Toshara</li><li>Improved Kay's movement animations on stairs and slopes</li><li>Adjusted effects of getting ionized in space</li><li>Fixed space NPCs going "out of bounds" when in combat</li><li>Miyuki Traders have been upgraded to full vendors and now sell passive system upgrades in addition to previous resource items</li><li>Fixed issue where the Ion upgrade of the smoke bomb was inconsistent in ionizing enemies</li><li>Fixed issue where melee finishers sometimes wouldn't trigger if the blaster is overheated</li><li>Fixed issue where configurations with improved heat capacity from upgrades and gear would risk overheating the blaster if quick switching modules when near the overheat threshold</li><li>Crimson Reign gear set has a reduced cooldown on Stun Shot for each enemy caught within all variants of the Smoke Bomb</li><li>Outlaw Belt has a reduced cooldown and increased duration of the supercooled state when swapping between Kay's blaster modules.

                <p>Saints Row developer Volition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/" data-ref-id="1100-6517393">which shuttered in 2023</a>, was developing a Harry Potter game, or at least a pitch for one, and now the first details and images from the project have emerged.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-zillion-years-before-hogwarts-legacy-pre-saints-row-volition-was-making-a-baldurs-gate-style-harry-potter-rpg-and-its-never-been-seen-by-the-public-before/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> learned about the game and saw images of it at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York recently. The report said developers at Volition, having been big fans of the books, assembled a demo for a Harry Potter game in 1999. This was before the first movie came out in 2001, so the developers created their own ideas for what some of the characters might look like. It's also worth mentioning that Volition at the time was known as Parallax Software Corporation.</p><p>The demo included a sequence where Hagrid and Harry Potter are walking around a cobblestone area, with players able to switch between both characters in a top-down RPG setup. The demo doesn't include much in the way of activities, and that's because, Strong Museum's Andrew Borman said, Volition made it in a couple of weeks to pitch to the rights-holders. You can <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-zillion-years-before-hogwarts-legacy-pre-saints-row-volition-was-making-a-baldurs-gate-style-harry-potter-rpg-and-its-never-been-seen-by-the-public-before/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see images of the game at GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Borman said executives from the game developer and publisher attended a pitch meeting in which at least some of the top bosses "came dressed in robes and had owls with them" in an apparent bid to help win the rights.</p><p>Volition's pitch was not successful, and Electronic Arts ultimately won the Harry Potter gaming rights, releasing numerous movie tie-ins over the years.</p><p>The newest Harry Potter game is Hogwarts Legacy, which launched in 2023 to great success. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/" data-ref-id="2900-4951">the year's best-selling game overall</a>, even outselling the new Call of Duty game that year. 2024's Quidditch Champions game was less successful, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-gets-unexpected-update-connection-to-upcoming-show/1100-6527589/" data-ref-id="1100-6527589">a Hogwarts Legacy sequel is now on the way.</a></p><p>The Harry Potter universe was created by author J.K. Rowling, who remains involved in the franchise. As such, her <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">comments on the trans community</a> continue to hang over the magical series.</p>
