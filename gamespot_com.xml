                <p>Although rapper Jarad Anthony Higgins--who was better known as Juice WRLD--passed away in 2019, he'll be a featured performer at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-the-fortnite-remix-finale-event-featuring-juice-wrld/1100-6527953/" data-ref-id="1100-6527953">the Fortnite Remix Finale Event</a> this weekend. Players can log into Fortnite this week and receive a free cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin the next time they return to the game. In addition to that in-game outfit and the finale event, the late musical artist is also getting his own Fortnite island via Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN).</p><p>Interscope Records, the Juice WRLD estate, and others collaborated to create the island to coincide with the rapper's final posthumous release, The Party Never Ends. The landscape of the island is built around a platform that leads players on a race to the top of a tower. If players need to rest before heading to the top, they can stop at the Xbox lounge and listen to some of Juice WRLD's previously unreleased music. There will also be other Juice WRLD-themed collectibles and music throughout the island.</p><p>Juice WRLD was an avid fan of Xbox, and he is also being honored by Xbox Design Lab with two new controllers that feature imagery inspired by the late rapper. Those controllers aren't endorsed or made by Epic, but they can be found <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/#anchor-inspiration?ocid=JuiceWRLD_soc_emc_xbo_tw_buy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Party Never Ends will be released on Friday, November 29, while Juice WRLD Island will launch the next day. Additionally, Xbox will host a Fortnite tournament on November 30 at the United Center in Chicago that will feature Juice WRLD Island as well as guest performers and a celebration of the rapper's life.</p><p>After the Fortnite Finale event, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-returns-in-december-and-its-here-to-stay/1100-6527703/" data-ref-id="1100-6527703">Fortnite OG is returning in December</a> on a permanent basis. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/godzilla-reportedly-stomping-into-fortnite-very-soon/1100-6527992/" data-ref-id="1100-6527992">Godzilla is even coming to Fortnite</a> during Chapter 6 next month.

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 players can rejoice as cross-play will be introduced with the game's next big update, Patch 8. Fans have been clamoring for cross-play capabilities for a while and soon PC players can join in with their console-playing friends--but that's not all. The patch also includes a brand-new photo mode and 12 new subclasses to use in the fight against the Absolute.</p><p>Stress testing for the update will go up in early January, and players will have the opportunity to sign up for it before then. The information for when and where will be available with the company's next Community Update. There's no word on when Patch 8 will release in full.</p><p>With cross-play, much like with other online games, players will be able to invite their friends to join a cross-play lobby directly, regardless of platform. They can also find other available multiplayer lobbies with friends on other systems using the Larian Network.</p><p>As for the subclasses, some are fan favorites from the tabletop version of Dungeons and Dragons, and others have been homebrewed in the game, such as Drunken Master. You can read more about each class over at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4461474037375172735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page for the game</a>, but here's the list:</p><ul><li>Bard - College of Glamour</li><li>Barbarian - Path of Giants</li><li>Cleric - Death Domain</li><li>Druid - Circle of Stars</li><li>Paladin - Oath of the Crown</li><li>Fighter - Arcane Archer</li><li>Monk - Drunken Master</li><li>Ranger - Swarmkeeper</li><li>Rogue - Swashbuckler</li><li>Sorcerer - Shadow Magic</li><li>Warlock - Hexblade</li><li>Wizard - Bladesinging</li></ul><p>Lastly, the all-new Photo Mode has a whole slew of options to let players customize and edit their in-game photos. Whether you're using it while adventuring, taking on your enemies, dialogue, or even cinematic scenes, players can grab a pic of their Tav and party. It will even include frames and the ability to use stickers with over 300 emojis, icons, blood splatters, textures, objects, and items to choose from to decorate your image just right.</p><p>Larian confirmed that it will be wrapping up its heavy-duty updates for Baldurâ€™s Gate 3 soon, but it reassured players that is not the end for its mod tools.</p><p>"With the continued support of mod authors in the community testing out new features, we have big updates still to come including adding even more functionality to let you tell your own stories," Larian said in a statement.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 is currently on sale for $48, with the Digital Deluxe Edition DLC also on sale for $8 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>.</p>
