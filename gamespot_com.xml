                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc R</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">aiders</a> is a high-octane third-person extraction shooter set in a dense city that's teeming with life. While the game isn't going to demand an ultra high-end PC full of the best hardware, you might see your rig struggle in certain areas and during gunfights if your settings aren't properly dialed in.</p><p>You never want to lose all of your gear during a drop due to laggy gameplay or frame drops. To stop that from happening, we have a full list of the optimal PC graphics settings you should be using in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Best graphics settings for Arc Raiders on PC</h2><p>There are a decent number of graphics settings to change in the main menu of Arc Raiders, not to mention all the other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we have to offer. From our testing, changing even the most basic graphics settings has a huge effect on the amount of frames per second you get, even with a high-end PC. That said, you'll certainly want to see where your FPS is at after changing your settings to see if you need to lower anything further.</p><p>If you're experiencing noticeably low frames or jarring stutters, you might have to take matters outside of Arc Raiders itself. Changing settings in the Nvidia Control Panel or the game's config files in your directory is a way to go beyond lowering every graphics option to its lowest value, and it can have a big impact on your performance.</p><p>For now, though, let's go over the best PC graphics settings for Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Window Mode</strong>: Fullscreen</li><li><strong>Display Resolution</strong>: Max resolution of your primary monitor (1920x1080, 2560x1440)</li><li><strong>Nvidia DLSS Frame Generation</strong>: Disabled (adds some input delay, but you can enable it if you're playing on PC with a controller or if you need a jump in FPS)</li><li><strong>Vsync</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency</strong>: On</li><li><strong>Frame Rate Limit</strong>: Set to your monitor's highest refresh rate (60,144, 240, etc.)</li><li><strong>Upscaled Resolution</strong>: 100%</li><li><strong>Resolution Scaling Method</strong>: Nvidia DLSS / AMD FSR</li><li><strong>DLSS Quality</strong>: Balanced or Performance</li><li><strong>DLSS Model</strong>: CNN</li><li><strong>Field of View</strong>: 80</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong>: Disabled</li><li><strong>Nvidia RTX Global Illumination</strong>: Static</li><li><strong>View Distance</strong>: High</li><li><strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Post-Processing</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Texture</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Reflections</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Foliage</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Global Illumination Resolution</strong>: Low</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223"></a><figcaption>The PC graphics settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png"></figure><p>In our testing, these settings still provided a clear picture on screen that wasn't blurry and kept all textures looking sharp. However, the performance bump from knocking down a few settings to either "Low" or "Medium" was substantial.</p><p>It's also important to set your Upscaling Method correctly, as that will provide you with the most significant leap in performance. You can also enable Frame Generation if you have a 40 or 50-series Nvidia graphics card, but you might feel some input delay in-game, especially if you're on a mouse and keyboard. However, when enabling Frame Generation, you'll see anywhere from 50 to 100 extra frames, making your game much smoother overall.</p><p>As it usually is with graphics settings on PC, you'll likely want to make some changes based on your performance in Arc Raiders. If you have a lower-end PC, then it's best to simply change every setting to its lowest value, set your upscaling to ultra performance, and maybe make some additional changes outside of the game. This might make your game look worse visually, but you should be able to reach a consistent 60 FPS at the very least.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you have a high-end PC, you can crank some settings up, such as view distance or textures, to give yourself a competitive advantage without sacrificing too much FPS. Use our settings to establish a foundation, head in-game to see your performance, and then make some changes if necessary.</p><p>If you're on keyboard and mouse in Arc Raiders, make sure to check out our other guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-keybinds-and-mouse-settings-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535833/" data-ref-id="1100-6535833">best keybinds and mouse settings</a>.</p>

                <p>If you've decided to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> on PC, then you'll have access to a couple of menus in the settings that console players won't have. From the first time you launch the game, you can find and alter the keybinds and mouse settings menus, which, of course, both have a massive impact on your gameplay.</p><p>While you could leave the default options as they are and not customize any of the settings, that might put you at a disadvantage against other PC players with dialed-in settings. To ensure you're using the best keybinds and mouse settings in Arc Raiders, take a look at the guide below, which is just one of several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we recommend.</p><h2>Best keybinds in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Let's start with the keybinds, as this is one of the first menus you'll see after heading into the settings (it's labeled "Controls"). Unlike some other extraction games or multiplayer shooters, Arc Raiders keeps things fairly straightforward when it comes to your keybinds. There are only a few crucial keybinds that you'll want to change, but these can play a huge role in whether you live or die during a gunfight with an enemy.</p><p>Below, you can see all of the keybinds and our recommended settings for each one in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Move Forward</strong>: W</li><li><strong>Move Backward</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Move Left</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Move Right</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Fire / Throw / Display</strong>: Left Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Aim</strong>: Right Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Jump</strong>: Space Bar</li><li><strong>Sprint (Hold)</strong>: Left Shift</li><li><strong>Crouch (Hold)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Crouch (Toggle)</strong>: Left Ctrl or C</li><li><strong>Dodge Roll</strong>: Mouse Button 4/5 or Left Alt if you have no mouse buttons</li><li><strong>Walk (Toggle)</strong>: V</li><li><strong>Interact</strong>: E or F (depending on preference)</li><li><strong>Reload Weapon</strong>: R</li><li><strong>Shoulder Swap</strong>: X</li><li><strong>Weapon 1</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Weapon 2</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Melee Weapon</strong>: 3</li><li><strong>Unarmed/Holster Weapon</strong>: 4</li><li><strong>Next Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Up</li><li><strong>Previous Weapon</strong>: Mouse Wheel Down</li><li><strong>Items</strong>: Q</li><li><strong>Flashlight</strong>: E or F (depending on your Interact keybind)</li><li><strong>Access Inventory</strong>: Tab</li><li><strong>Map</strong>: M or Caps Lock</li><li><strong>Ping</strong>: Middle Mouse Button</li><li><strong>Emote</strong>: G</li><li><strong>Push to Talk</strong>: T</li><li><strong>Push to Talk (Proximity Chat)</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Ping Heard By/Emote Loudness</strong>: H</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594104"></a><figcaption>The keybinds menu in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594104-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.32.43.99.png"></figure><p>We didn't alter too many of the default keybinds in Arc Raiders, but we did offer you some choices with a few of those we did change. For example, the dodge roll mechanic works great if you have a mouse button on the side of your mouse, but Left Alt also works perfectly well. We also swapped the "unarmed" keybind to "4," as that's easier to remember given that you can bring out your other weapons with the previous three number keybinds.</p><h2>Best mouse settings in Arc Raiders</h2><p>Now, let's cover your mouse settings in Arc Raiders, which boil down to your sensitivity options. If you want to customize your mouse and sensitivity further, you should head into whatever mouse software you have installed on your PC. This allows you to fine-tune your DPI, disable mouse smoothing/acceleration, and set up hotkeys if you wish.</p><p>Below, you can see our recommended mouse settings in Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Invert Vertical Look Input</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity</strong>: 65-70</li><li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity</strong>: 50</li><li><strong>Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 75%</li><li><strong>Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier</strong>: 85%</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594103"></a><figcaption>The mouse settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594103-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.36.29.43.png"></figure><p>We decided to scale the horizontal sensitivity up by 15-20 from the default value. Having a higher horizontal sensitivity allows you to spin around faster if you're being shot by an enemy behind you, or maybe to catch the spider hurdling at you before your quick and sudden death.</p><p>Moving on, the Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has been reduced by 25% to allow for more precise aiming, while the Scoped Zoom Sensitivity Multiplier has also been reduced, but not as drastically. You still want to be able to move relatively quickly while using a large scope, but you also don't want your sensitivity too fast so that you skip right over a target when aiming down sights.</p><p>Of course, these sensitivity values will likely need to be changed depending on your mouse's core DPI. You'll want to make sure you dial that in before trying to mess around with the mouse settings in Arc Raiders. If you already have your mouse DPI in a good spot, then try to use our sensitivity values as a baseline and work your way up or down from there.</p>
