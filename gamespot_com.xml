                <p>Nearly a year ago, Rockstar Games debuted the first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which marks the franchise's first sequel since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in 2013. Fans had been hoping that today's fiscal report for Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, would include a new GTA 6 trailer. While that didn't happen, Take-Two did confirm that the GTA sequel is still on track for a fall 2025 release.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that some of the company's previous games have slipped from their originally announced release dates. However, he expressed his confidence that GTA 6 would make its release window. Zelnick also stressed that the extended development of the game is more centered on enhancing the experience rather than ironing out bugs.</p><p>"In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs, it's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do," explained Zelnick. "And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p><p>The company noted in this year's fiscal statements that GTA 5 has sold 205 million copies to date across all platforms, while Red Dead Redemption 2 had 67 million copies to its name. Take-Two also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433">Mafia: The Old Country</a> are set to be released during the company's fiscal 2026, which should fall between April 1, 2025, and March 31, 2026. The other upcoming titles mentioned by name, CSR Racing 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/" data-ref-id="1100-6522180">Judas</a>, don't have release windows yet.</p>
