                <p dir="ltr">Many of us have a game franchise that, despite liking everything we hear about it, we have never actually played any of the games. I have a few, but one notable blind spot in my gaming resume was Yakuza, or as it's called now, Like A Dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd been told by many friends that the series has something for everyone, from heavy action scenes to lighthearted goofiness, all with real emotion at the center… and yet I still never found the time. This year saw the release of Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth, and for a while I thought it would be just another game to add to my backlog. However, thanks to a freelance opportunity, I finally found my excuse to play a Like A Dragon game for the first time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415490"></a><figcaption>Listening to Orlando's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415490-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Through the first few chapters, I was enjoying myself, but I wasn't yet seeing what others had told me about the series all these years. That changed in Chapter 4, when I approached a shaved-ice shop on the streets of Hawaii, and Substory 24: Let It Snow began.</p><p dir="ltr">Let It Snow begins with Ichiban finding a man in a plaid shirt buying shaved ice (also known as a snow cone) at a local shop. Curiously, the man asks for no toppings on his dessert, and then once he receives the treat, he throws it into the air. As the ice immediately melts--this is Hawaii, after all--the man screams in anguish and leaves distraught. Ichiban watches this happen, and other than feeling it's really strange, doesn't think much more of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Later, we find the same man being denied shaved ice at a second stand, as the proprietor had caught wind of his weird motives. Dejected, the man sits at a nearby bench, where Ichiban can sit with him and learn his story.</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out this man, whose name we learn is Orlando, is trying to fulfill his wife Ellie's dying wish: "I want to see the snow with you again." The couple, Orlando explains, have a lot of fond memories involving snow, including their honeymoon in Japan, and while he wanted to take her back, real-life responsibilities got in the way. She wants to see snow fall with her beloved one more time before she dies, which can be any time now. Ichiban agrees to help, and the two part ways for the moment.</p><p dir="ltr">So, uh, yeah…when I first saw a weird old dude throwing shaved ice into the sky, I did not think it would lead me to "super emotional story about a man trying to help his wife on her deathbed." This is exactly the kind of thing my friends have been telling me about, and I have to admit it's effective. That's the beauty of the writing at work here; just when you think you have it all figured out, Like A Dragon surprises you. And, as the Substory continued, surprise me it <em>absolutely did</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">Later on in a nearby shopping center, Ichiban watches a woman lose a stroller down an escalator. Ichiban chases the stroller--the chase consisting of quick-time events to complete--until he catches it and brings it to a stop. Ichiban looks into the stroller, only to find <em>a grown man in a diaper staring back at him</em>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415492"></a><figcaption>Not what you'd expect to see in a bassinet!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415492-like-a-dragon-substory-sold-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is Susumu Gondawara, a yakuza boss from a previous game who veteran Like A Dragon players would know to expect, but I was completely caught off guard. This hulking baby man says his stroller got away from the "nanny" he hired, and he wants Ichiban to take him back to her. However, three of Gondawara's henchmen--also, inexplicably, in nothing but diapers--accuse Ichiban of kidnapping Gondawara, and the fight is on.</p><p dir="ltr">Once they're defeated, Gondawara asks for some milk--and the only place to find it is a nearby shaved-ice truck, which uses condensed milk as a topping. One of the henchmen gets in line, only for a man in a familiar plaid shirt to force himself into the front and ask for a shaved ice with no topping.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Ichiban, Orlando, and Gondawara all speak together, and try to come up with a solution to the problem. Orlando worries they're running out of time, and Ichiban throws his shaved ice to the ground in frustration… however, the group notices that the ice didn't melt, and instead turned to a snow-like substance. How did this happen?</p><p dir="ltr">Are you ready?</p><p dir="ltr">You'll never guess…</p><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the absorbent of the diapers Gondawara and his men are wearing <em>mixed with the shaved ice</em>, and the combination created the "snow." I'd heard Like A Dragon could be wacky, but I don't think I realized just how wacky things could get. After Gondawara explains the difference between his group's "baby play" fantasy and real-world honor, the three agree to a plan.</p><p dir="ltr">The scene then shifts to the hotel where Orlando and Ellie are staying, where--and I cannot believe I'm typing these words--Ichiban, Gondawara, and the underlings mix diaper absorbent with shaved ice, then throw it off of the rooftop of the hotel. Orlando and Ellie, together in their room just below said rooftop, see the "snow" come through the window and are delighted.</p><p dir="ltr">Ellie calls Orlando a "magician," before asking for one more last wish: She wants to see Orlando smile one last time before she falls asleep. He obliges, tears welling in his eyes, and she eventually falls asleep for the final time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4415493"></a><figcaption>Ellie's final moments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4415493-like-a-dragon-substory-sold.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, to recap, in order to help a desperate man fulfill the final wish of his dying wife, our hero Ichiban:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Enlisted the help of a man who likes to act as a baby</li><li dir="ltr">Mixed absorbent from that man's adult diaper supply with shaved ice to create "snow"</li><li dir="ltr">Threw the mixture off of a roof, so the desperate man and his wife could see it fall from the room below.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite the sheer wackiness making this whole thing happen, the heart at the core of the scene cannot be denied. Ichiban stepped up to help a stranger, simply because he could, and he made a dying woman's final wish come true in the process. Once the "snow" started to fall, and the scene focused on Orlando and Ellie, I forgot about the absurdities of it all and focused on the relatable, human story at the center of the Substory, and it filled me with a warmth that most games aren't capable of creating… until the scene switches back to Ichiban and company, where Gondawara's henchmen are laying on the rooftop exhausted--and buck naked. It's a last bit of wackiness to send us off; this is Like A Dragon, after all.</p><p dir="ltr">After years of being told I would like this series, and never having time to check it out, Infinite Wealth was officially my first foray into what Like A Dragon/Yakuza has to offer. Thanks to Substory 24: Let It Snow, I've seen the light. I'm sold, and I plan to go back and see what I've been missing all this time as soon as possible--and all it took was a little "winter" magic.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Most mornings, I stumble out of bed, grab my phone, and crack open some Pokemon packs. Over the last month, I've been consumed by the routine of booting up Pokemon TCG Pocket, a mobile adaptation of the popular card game, and--much like the video games and show encourage--catching 'em all. I've blown through dozens of booster packs by now chasing the thrill of filling my digital library with rare holographic and full-art cards. I know for a fact I'm not alone in this craze, either. Group chats of mine are filled with friends sharing the rewards of their booster packs, and my social media feeds often consist of a handful of screenshots of someone's haul. That's not all that I've seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Everywhere I looked this year, some kind of card game was killing it and dominating conversations and minds. Balatro grabbed a hold of gamers early into the year and never particularly let go. My favorite part of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth wasn't taking Tifa on a date or watching Nomura and company continue to reinterpret FF7's mythos; it was taking a break from the bloated open world and throwing down the gauntlet in games of Queen's Blood, a territory-based card game within the expansive RPG, and I wasn't the only one who fell in love with it. Everyone I know now plays Magic: The Gathering, and after numerous alluring crossovers and bids from friends, I do too. And by the very end of the year, Pokemon TCG Pocket became a part of all of our day-to-day lives, allowing us to chase the thrilling feeling of filling a digital library with some of our favorite creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">The point is: In 2024, we proverbially bet big on card games. We went all in, so to speak, and it's fascinating to wonder why this trend has picked up so much steam in recent years. These games vary in complexity and mechanics, but are there some underlying qualities that unify all these examples and make sense of the incredible year that they've enjoyed?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418892"></a><figcaption>Balatro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418892-7503960715-ss_d1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, I think a lot of us have just been craving something simpler, and most of the aforementioned games certainly fit the bill. Balatro is, as its tagline suggests, Solitaire by way of Poker, a combination of one of oldest genres and one of the most widely played games of all time. Strip away the multipliers, the infectious music, and the booster packs (which are purchased with in-game money, not microtransactions), and it is a deceptively simple concept: produce winning hands like straights and flushes while meeting increasingly ludicrous demands and score totals. There are obviously mechanical and aesthetic flourishes which complicate matters, like the presence of game-altering jokers and a roguelike framework that appears to allow for endless play, but it really is a game to idly play for hours because, when broken down, it is as easy to understand as 1, 2, 3.</p><p dir="ltr">To a certain degree, you can play a lot of these games, which mostly boast easy-to-understand rulesets and formats, on auto-pilot. I can recognize a flush and quickly finish a round of Balatro with nary a thought in a crowded airport. Pokemon TCG Pocket actually features an auto-battle feature, in case you are mostly in it for the little guys rather than the dueling. Queen's Blood eventually becomes a much more complicated game if you follow its questline to the very end, but otherwise it's a pretty straightforward game of terrain conquest and making numbers go up. It's refreshing to take a break from world-ending plots, menus upon menus, and consequential decisions to slip back into something more comforting, and that's what these card games often have been. It was as true for Triple Triad and Gwent as it is for countless of these modern examples, and the fact that the trend has persisted for so long suggests that players definitely have an appetite for them.</p><p dir="ltr">In cases where there's an undeniable level of complexity though, like with Magic: The Gathering and even high-level play of the aforementioned games, there's something else entirely that seems to bring players into the fold, and I know it's definitely been true for me.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a social aspect to card games that shouldn't be discounted. The biggest reason that I've been turned onto them of late is that everyone around me is doing something with them. Many of my closest friends have been buying Pokemon booster packs and collecting them for several months or years now. My roommate began having friends over to play matches of Magic: The Gathering's Commander format at our dining-room table for hours on end. For months on end, I've watched from the outside as folks fell madly in love with Balatro's blend of poker and roguelike mechanics, committed to runs composed of ridiculous power-ups and multipliers, and forged challenges to issue others.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418893"></a><figcaption>TCG Card Shop Simulator</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418893-7996134217-ss_19.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>As someone who tends to play games in solitude, or at the very least with a very select few, I looked to my colleagues and friends adopting these card games and building new rituals amongst each other and wanted in on the sense of community they were building up. I wanted to delight in the joy of awesome new rare card art with others. I wanted to try out something new in spaces filled with people I trusted. I wanted to be where the people were, and if that meant huddling around a table in person and learning the convoluted rules of new games, then so be it. Hell, even this very experience that I'm detailing was adapted to a game called TCG Card Shop Simulator, and that game did gangbusters, proving to me that I'm not alone in wanting these communal spaces that card games are so uniquely good at fostering.</span></p><p dir="ltr">I learned to love card games over middle-school lunches. Growing up, I collected cards aplenty, but I never bothered learning their rules and functions. It was regular bouts of Yu-Gi-Oh at lunchtime that first gave me a real appetite for card games. That and a youth spent playing Solitaire. Even then, they were a break from talk of Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, or whatever monstrously large RPG was the game du jour. And even then, it gave me an opportunity to sit around and really connect with people. Years later, I'm picking them back up for so many of the same reasons, and it leaves me wondering if everyone else is too?</p><p dir="ltr">What's most exciting is that this card fever isn't going anywhere. Slay the Spire 2 is on the horizon, and if that first game was any indication, it's going to be one of the biggest games of 2025. Balatro has spent the year adding card collections themed around other games, dubbing these crossovers "Friends of Jimbo," and I'm sure there are many more to come. Riot Games just recently announced that it's expanding its League of Legends transmedia push into the realm of trading cards, and I'm sure there's even more in the works. Whether it was digitally or physically, it's hard to deny that card games have enjoyed a great deal of success this year, and it looks primed to spill over into the next.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
