Speaking to Conner Mather (<a href="https://x.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/1868620511061627152" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GTA VI Countdown</a>), Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said the developers at Rockstar Games are trying to deliver something unexpected with GTA VI, even if that takes time.</p><p>"Our teams are focused on what's new that you haven't even thought about. You thought you were anticipating this thing but this is way bigger and way better and more exciting and more beautiful than you could have possibly thought of," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said he understands that fans have become "a little frustrated" as Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">works in secrecy on GTA VI.</a> But he said Take-Two's philosophy is to "wait for a title to be ready" before releasing it.</p><p>"I think [GTA VI] will be extraordinary and worth waiting for," he said, adding that he expects GTA VI to be "breathtaking."</p><p>Of course, part of Zelnick's job is to hype his company's products and use all kinds of marketing speak and buzzwords to get people excited, so hearing him say all of this is no surprise.</p><p>Another noteworthy tidbit from the interview is that Zelnick said he is aware of the GTA VI memes about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-got-x-before-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"We got ___ before GTA VI."</a> He said, "I've seen some of those."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R09uNAeQNdg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R09uNAeQNdg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GTA VI is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">set for release in Fall 2025</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.

Rival publishers are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">reportedly waiting to assign dates to their own games</a> until Rockstar Games officially announces a release date for GTA VI.</p><p>In other news, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publishers-reportedly-waiting-for-gta-6-release-date-before-setting-their-own-2025-dates/1100-6528325/" data-ref-id="1100-6528325">recent report</a> said that with GTA VI, "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p>

                <p>Epic Games has had its share of legal victories over the years, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-wins-case-to-open-up-android-store-but-google-is-appealing/1100-6527001/" data-ref-id="1100-6527001">one over Google earlier in 2024</a>. But when it comes to the federal government, the United States Justice Department just came down on Epic Games for violating Section 8 of the Clayton Act, which was put in place to keep members of the board of one company from being able to serve in the same capacity on a competitor's board.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Justice Department announced</a> that two members of Epic's board who were appointed by Tencent have voluntarily stepped down after the government raised the Clayton Act issue through its Antitrust Division. Tencent is a minority owner of Epic, and also the majority owner of Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends. Epic has since confirmed that the two departing board members are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein. Additionally, Tencent has relinquished its right to appoint any additional members to Epic's board of directors.</p><p>"Our relationship with Epic has always centered on making great games and delivering great experiences for players and developers," said a Tencent spokesperson. "We look forward to continuing to work with them on this shared vision."</p><p>Epic subsequently announced that Feder and Wallerstein will be replaced by "two new independent board members [who] will be nominated by committees of Epic's shareholders." Feder and Wallerstein will presumably retain their positions on Tencent's board.</p><p>Tencent is also a minority owner of Ubisoft, which is currently in negotiations with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-co-founders-want-to-maintain-control-as-talks-with-tencent-continue-report/1100-6528283/" data-ref-id="1100-6528283">about a potential management buyout</a>. The Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--reportedly wants to maintain control of the company in any deal, while Ubisoft has been said to be in a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for any future investment in the company. For now, no deal between the two companies has been announced.</p><p>Earlier this week, Epic went to court <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-sues-fornite-tournament-cheater/1100-6528556/" data-ref-id="1100-6528556">to sue an alleged cheater</a>, whom the company claims has used unauthorized software to gain an unfair advantage during several of the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> tournaments, which allowed him to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-calls-out-apple-for-arbitrary-rejection-of-its-new-app-store/1100-6524733/" data-ref-id="1100-6524733">Epic is still butting heads with Apple</a> over the former's desire to build an app store.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The longtime franchise mode in the Madden NFL series lets players make decisions for their favorite team, such as drafting players and signing free agents. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making. In fact, Johnson reportedly axed a trade this past offseason involving a wide receiver because the player's rating in Madden NFL 24 was too low.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Jets were close to agreeing to a trade with the Denver Broncos in March for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. But then, Johnson reportedly killed negotiations after looking at Jeudy's Madden NFL 24 rating. Electronic Arts tweaks player ratings throughout the season, but <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/24/madden-nfl-24-denver-broncos-ratings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Denver Post</a> notes that Jeudy was an overall 83 before the start of last season. Interestingly enough, the wide receiver--who ultimately was traded to the Cleveland Browns--still sports the same <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/ratings/player-ratings/jerry-jeudy/20940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">83 overall rating in Madden NFL 25</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="33909110" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September. It won the award for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024</a>. This year's show also introduced the "Game Changer" award for Amir Satvat, who has helped laid-off game developers find openings at other companies over the last year.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2 review</a>, we said, "Frostpunk 2's challenging gameplay makes for a compelling experience despite a dour and cynical view of human nature."</p>
