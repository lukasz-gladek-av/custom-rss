                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a>, the popular ghosthunting sim from Kinetic Games, is being turned into a horror movie. The film is coming from Blumhouse, a production company that has made a great number of horror movies in recent years, including Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious, among many more. James Wan's company, Atomic Monster, is also attached to the project.</p><p>The game studio's director and lead developer, Daniel Knight, said in a press release that the team is "thrilled" to announce the movie is in the works. "We never could’ve imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we’re so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond," Knight continued. "Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can’t wait to share more as the project develops."</p><p>Phasmophobia launched as a Steam Early Access game in 2020 and quickly became a hit for friend groups looking for a fun (and terrifying) co-op game during the pandemic. It's gone on to sell more than 22 million copies, and last year debuted on Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The next major update for the game is called Chronicle and seeks to overhaul the game's leveling system and in-game rewards. Sometime next year, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-phasmophobia-to-be-so-terrifying-the-devil-is-in-the-details/1100-6527456/" data-ref-id="1100-6527456">already-frightening game</a> is meant to get even scarier with its Horror 2.0 update.</p><p>No release window for the Phasmophobia movie was announced, and it's worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/" data-ref-id="2900-5059">video game movies get announced</a> much more often than they get made. However, given the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-movie-succeeded-beyond-my-wildest-dreams-creator-says/1100-6518853/" data-ref-id="1100-6518853">Five Nights at Freddy's movie's success</a>, one could argue Blumhouse knows how to get these projects to the finish line--a sequel to that one is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-2-gets-a-creepy-new-teaser-image/1100-6532000/" data-ref-id="1100-6532000">set to arrive later this year</a>.</p>

                <p>If you've been playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> for a while--and there's a decent chance you have, since it's been out for 11 years--playing as just a regular human sim might be a little bit boring at this point. Fortunately, there are plenty of non-human options, in the form of "occult" sims--you know, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and all that stuff. In The Sims 4, your sim can abandon the trappings of normal life and try out an entirely new state of being--so long as they know where to look to find one, that is.</p><p dir="ltr">But that's why we're here. We've gathered all the key details about each of the occult life states in The Sims 4--werewolves, vampires, mermaids, aliens, magic wielders, and ghosts--and assembled them below in a relatively short, sweet, and easy-to-digest way so you can get started investigating the stranger ways of life in Maxis' life sim.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><ul><li><a href="#How_to_create_an_occult_sim_by_birth">How to create an occult sim by birth</a></li></ul><li><a href="#1__Vampire__Vampires_DLC_">1.

The rules are the same for all occult varieties. With two parents of the same occult type, the offspring is guaranteed to also be one of them--two vampire parents equals a vampire baby. With one occult parent and one normal human sim as the other parent, there's a 50% chance of the baby also having that parent's occult life state.</p><p dir="ltr">If parents of two different occult types have a kid, like if a vampire hooked up with a werewolf, the child will have an even chance of being one of the two types. But it won't be both, as the Sims 4 doesn't natively support occult hybrids. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">there are mods</a> that can help with that.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, let's dive into the details for each specific occult type.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="1__Vampire__Vampires_DLC_">1. Vampire (Vampires DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can make your sim a vampire in Create-a-Sim, by having them become pals with a vampire and ask them to turn them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When your sim becomes a vampire, their energy and hunger needs are replaced by vampire energy and thirst, and they'll no longer have to use the toilet. Oh, and they'll never age. But it's not all positive, as vampires can die from sun exposure, they get sick if they eat food, and they constantly need to feed their thirst for blood, or they'll go feral and start attacking people randomly.</p><p dir="ltr">Vampires also have a unique skill chart that they can progress through by doing vampire things. Through the skill chart, they can become much more powerful and remove some of the downsides of vampirism, like vulnerability to sunlight, and they'll gain special powers as they improve themselves. But leveling up their vampire skills will require taking some negative perks as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The path of the vampire provides an alternate method to reach some of the lifetime aspiration rewards that would otherwise take much longer to earn, like removing the need to sleep or bathe. And vampirism has a major advantage over all other forms of immortality in The Sims 4, because there's a perk that deadens your sim's emotions so they don't get super depressed any time one of their distant relatives dies--which might be pretty often if your sim has lived a long time. And while the thirst is obnoxious, it's very easy to obtain plasma packs and fruit so you don't have to feed on other sims if you don't want to.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The downsides of being a vampire are well known: sunlight will kill them, garlic is poison, they can't sleep in a normal bed, and they have to drink blood all the time. Fortunately, you can mitigate most of the biggest negatives, but the fact that you must take several bad perks along with the good ones as you level up your vampire skills means being a vampire is never smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure vampirism</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims who have maxed out their Vampire Lore skill will be able to mix the Ultimate Vampire Cure using the mixology skill at any bar. They just have to drink it to return to normal.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="2__Werewolf__Werewolves_DLC_">2. Werewolf (Werewolves DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Make one in Create-a-Sim, or have a werewolf bite a sim and turn.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will become a werewolf, and will transform into its wolf form every full moon. They'll have a new gauge on the needs panel called Fury, which will increase regularly as a result of mood changes or doing werewolf activities--the more fury your werewolf sims have, the more animalistic their behavior will become. As part of this system, all werewolves in The Sims 4 have a temperament that dictates what sorts of things get them riled up.</p><p dir="ltr">Werewolves also have their own unique skill tree that will allow them to level up their abilities and dampen some of the downsides. In addition to the standard skill tree, werewolves can unlock six dormant abilities by doing specific activities. And, naturally, they can form wolf packs that run together--this social group is key to werewolf happiness, as they aren't loners like vampires.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Playing as a werewolf provides some pretty offbeat new options for how to play The Sims 4--one werewolf perk, for example, allows your sim to eat the furniture, and another allows you to quickly travel around by burrowing through the ground. And, like most occult types, once you've maxed out the skill tree, your sim can live forever. They'll still age, but they won't die from being old.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Fury meter can be pretty obnoxious to keep under control in the early goings, as going into a rampage is really not great for your sim's social standing in the community. But werewolves don't have any mortal vulnerabilities like vampires do. Even so, this is the most esoteric of the occult states, making it the biggest departure from standard Sims 4 gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure the werewolf condition</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A sim can turn back into a regular person using the Lunar Epiphany dormant ability, which is unlocked by reading werewolf tomes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="3__Spellcaster__Realm_of_Magic_DLC_">3. Spellcaster (Realm of Magic DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-Sim, by asking for the Rite of Ascension from one of the sages in the Magic Realm, or by asking another spellcaster sim who is powerful enough.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spellcasters will unlock a unique skill tree that they can progress through by using any magical ability, but they'll also have to learn magic powers and alchemical recipes individually. Your sim can do this by practicing each of the three magic types to learn spells, or by experimenting with a cauldron to learn potion recipes. They'll also be able to use magic wands, which will enhance their powers.</p><p dir="ltr">However, using magic will also increase a new spellcaster charge meter--the higher that meter is, the more likely a spell will malfunction and might kill your sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Learning spells and potions will unlock all sorts of mundane abilities that will make your sim's life easier, like the ability to repair any broken object in an instant, or duplicate stuff. You could brew a Potion of Plentiful Needs, which fills all your sim's need meters, and then use the copypasto spell to dupe it until you have a lifetime supply of them for your entire extended family. Your sim can also brew a Potion of Immortality, which will prevent them from ever dying of old age, or use a spell to turn a ghost back into a living sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are no downsides to becoming a spellcaster. Everything about this lifestate is an improvement.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to get rid of your spellcaster status</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can take the Rite of Dissolution from any of the sages in the Magic Realm to remove your spellcaster status. If your sim then decides to become a spellcaster again later, their power will be at the same level as it was before, but you'll need to reassign the skill tree perks again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="4__Alien__Get_to_Work_DLC_">4. Alien (Get to Work DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims cannot turn into aliens--they have to be made in Create-a-Sim, or born that way. But a sim can use a satellite to goad aliens into abducting them, which sometimes results in an alien pregnancy regardless of your sim's gender. Kids born as a result will always be aliens.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's different when playing as an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Not much changes with the alien life state compared with the other occult types. Aliens can have blue or purple skin, and can disguise themselves as humans to avoid any awkwardness. There's no skill tree, per se, but aliens have unique abilities, like being able to transmute a metal or crystal into another kind of metal or crystal at random. They also have empathy skills that allow them to understand the feelings of any sim they speak to, and they can also copy their emotional state.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, playing as an alien sim is like playing as a normal sim but with a couple extra perks. So it's different, but not <em>that</em> different.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">None</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="5__Mermaid__Island_Living_DLC_">5. Mermaid (Island Living DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-sim, being born that way, or by eating Mermadic Kelp that you can find in the world or purchase from the aspiration rewards for 500 points.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When a sim becomes a mermaid, they grow a tail. They can still turn back into their normal form with legs when on land, however. They'll also swap the hunger need for the unique hydration need--mermaids have to stay moist, or they will die.</p><p dir="ltr">Mermaids receive a number of inherent abilities, which deplete the hydration meter with each use--you'll need to be careful with them or else your sim will dry themselves out. They can sing various lullabies that inspire specific moods in the sims who hear them. They can talk to fish and dolphins, and they can do evil stuff too, like luring swimmers into the water and then pulling them under, potentially drowning them. They can also control the weather to a small degree.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">If your sim lives in Sulani or another watery world, the mermaid's ability to swim much faster than a normal sim can be a huge boon, and the ability to talk to and become pals with fish is fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The hydration meter can be tougher to deal with if you don't live next to the ocean. While baths and showers do help, swimming in pools or using hot tubs (or anything else with chlorinated water) will actually dry your sim out more.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="6__Ghost__Life__amp__Death_DLC_">6. Ghost (Life &amp; Death DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Die.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim becomes a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will no longer be a corporeal being, and will instead become a glowing spirit. This unlocks the Ghost Mastery skill tree, which allows a sim not just to gain new ghostly abilities, but also to choose whether they become a good ghost or a dastardly one. Examples of the bad ghost abilities include haunting household objects, giving other sims nightmares, or cursing them with bad luck. On the friendly side of things, a ghost sim can replenish a living sim's needs, save the life of a sim who just died, or just bless them with good fortune.</p><p dir="ltr">Occult sims who died as a result of their weakness, like a vampire dying to sunlight, will retain their occult abilities in their ghost form.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Since they have no physical presence, ghosts can do a lot of random things normal sims can't, like walking through walls or even other sims--which makes them feel strange, but in a good way. Ghosts can also do jump scares for fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While a ghost can do most things a regular sim can, there are limits--a ghost can't have a kid, for one thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to stop being a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The ghost state is the only occult state that can be cured in multiple different ways. A ghost can be turned back into a living sim using a Book of Life written by an author sim, by cooking ambrosia, or by using the magic spell Dedeathify. A ghost can also pass on and be reincarnated as a new sim by swimming in the waters of Revenwood.</p>

Evidence suggests that this effort was also quite messy and potentially destructive for the agency's efforts, contributing to several CIA sources being exposed. </p><p>A security researcher named Ciro Santilli recently published an extensive report on his work to discover and catalogue this network, providing immense detail into how this operation occurred.

For instance, <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-cia-secretly-ran-a-star-wars-fan-site/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as described in 404 Media's reporting</a>, many of the websites had sequential IP addresses, and related sites were easily revealed through basic DNS lookup services. In addition to starwarsweb.net, the CIA also appears to have created multiple gaming-focused websites. Among these are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110207193330/http://havenofgamerz.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">havenofgamerz.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110202125821/http://activegaminginfo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">activegaminginfo.com</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110209004241/http://myonlinegamesource.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">myonlinegamingsource.com</a> (all links to Wayback Machine snapshots). </p><p>The CIA's website network was revealed in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reuters report from 2022</a> to be at the center of a disastrous intelligence failure that resulted in a number of informants and sources being compromised. The Reuters story focused in particular on how Iran's regime was able to identify informants by uncovering the CIA's communications channels hidden in Iranian-focused websites. The information provided in this report--including names and screenshots of wesbites--gave Santilli the traces he needed to dig into the larger network. </p><p>The intelligence operation was extensive, targeting many different countries throughout the world, and the processes to research the operation after the fact have been even more complex. If you're interested in learning more about the investigation, I highly recommend checking out 404's article, which includes more detail from Santilli himself. </p>

                <p>After many years without the beloved game type, Grifball is finally debuting in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>. Microsoft has announced that an official version of the 4 vs. 4 football-like game is launching on June 10, marking the end of a long drought.</p><p>Microsoft announced Grifball's triumphant return in a video posted on X, which you can see embedded below. In an homage to Grifball's roots as a creation of Rooster Teeth and to Machinima culture more broadly, the video features an in-game conversation between two Halo characters (replete with the trademark head-nods that indicate the current speaker).</p><p>This teaser is currently all we know about the Halo Infinite incarnation of Grifball, which is described as a "new era." The fan community has frequently requested an official version of the match type, but to no avail. While developer Halo Studios has not specified exactly <em>why </em>it's taken this long, community speculation suggests that certain differences in Halo Infinite from past games, such as the mechanics of the Gravity Hammer, have caused challenges to Grifball implementation. As such, Grifball has remained playable in recent years only in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">The Master Chief Collection</a>.</p><p>While things have been quiet on the Halo front lately, the developer has continued updating Halo Infinite with new content and game modes. Earlier this year, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-brings-back-beloved-co-op-mode/1100-6530079/" data-ref-id="1100-6530079">the beloved co-op mode Firefight Classic</a> was added to Infinite; last month, the game got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-adding-one-of-halos-most-absurd-and-incredible-looking-guns-to-date/1100-6531297/" data-ref-id="1100-6531297">a particularly absurd gun called the Mutilator</a>.</p><p>It's still probably too early to get any announcements about upcoming Halo games--don't hold your breath for Halo reveals at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">the Xbox showcase</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest/">Summer Games Fest</a>--but Halo Studies is working on new titles. Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Halo Studios provided an overview for its long-term roadmap</a>, sharing that several new Halo entries are in the works, and they'll all use Unreal Engine 5.</p>

                <p>Actor Jonathan Joss, who had voice-acted in a number of high-profile video games, was killed this week outside his home in an attack that his husband has alleged was a homophobic hate crime. He was 59 years old and leaves behind a legacy of roles across television, movies, and games.</p><p>Joss, who was of Comanche and White Mountain Apache descent, provided his voice for numerous games across his career. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430885/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his IMDB page</a>, Joss had roles in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-walking-dead-michonne-a-telltale-miniseries/" data-ref-id="5000-438500">The Walking Dead: Michonne</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wasteland-3/" data-ref-id="5000-458193">Wasteland 3</a>. He also provided the voice for Robert Rainwater, a ripperdoc in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p>Outside of games, he was best known for his roles as indigenous characters in television comedies. Between 1997-2007, he played John Redcorn on King of the Hill; later, he appeared in several episodes of Parks and Recreation as casino magnate and tribal chief Ken Hotate.</p><p><i>Warning: sensitive and potentially disturbing details about Joss's death are discussed below</i>.</p><p>Joss was shot dead on June 1, 2025, at his house in San Antonio, TX. He had just married his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, on Valentine's Day earlier this year. After Joss's death, de Gonzales asserted that Joss was the victim of an anti-gay attack by a neighbor, who was described as yelling homophobic slurs at the couple. De Gonzales relayed how they returned to their home, which had previously burnt down, to check their mail, and they discovered remains of one of their dogs had been placed "in clear view." Expressing sadness and despair, the couple was confronted by the neighbor who opened fire, de Gonzales stated.</p><p>De Gonazles shared that the couple had faced homophobic harassment in their neighborhood for an extended period of time, and their reports to law enforcement had received no response. The San Antonio police <a href="https://abc7.com/post/jonathan-joss-killed-san-antonio-shooting-police-sayknown-character-king-hill-tulsa-parks-rec/16637058/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has responded</a> that it has not found any evidence to charge the suspect with a hate crime, and <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/cried-wolf-nothing-done-king-hill-actor-jonathan-joss-pitchfork-neighbors/273-2d9d7e2c-b5fd-42af-97aa-570f6a4a55e3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">neighbors have shared</a> that Joss and the suspect had a years-long feud that had gone unresolved.</p><p>Many actors who worked with Joss in the past have been outspoken in their sadness about his passing. Nick Offerman, who played Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation, told <a href="https://people.com/nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-cast-texting-about-jonathan-joss-death-all-day-11746985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">People Magazine</a> that the other actors from the sitcom extensively discussed and supported each other in the aftermath of the tragic events.</p>

                <p>Not much is known about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect game</a>, but producer Mike Gamble has now shared a small morsel of news regarding a feature that may return for the next entry: lens flare.</p><p>Posting on social media, Gamble used the "OK" emoji in response to a fan who said, "Mass Effect 5 better stick to tradition and have an excessive amount of lens flare."</p><p>The Mass Effect series is known for its creative and frequent use of lens flare, which is a filmmaking technique popularized by Hollywood directors like JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg. Obviously a video game does not use a physical camera like a Hollywood movie might, but games like Mass Effect are known to embrace lens flare for dramatic and stylistic effect.</p><p>Gamble's emoji response is not total confirmation of anything at all, but it's a strong suggestion that this one feature from past games may return. Given how silent BioWare has been about the game so far, fans are looking for any piece of news they can get their hands on.</p><p>With no expansions planned for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare's developers are now turning their attention to the next Mass Effect game. There is no word yet, however, on when the game may be released--so far, BioWare has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-with-mysterious-concept-art/1100-6508956/" data-ref-id="1100-6508956">only released a few teasers for it.</a></p><p>In addition to a new Mass Effect game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">Mass Effect TV series is said to be in the works at Amazon MGM Studios</a>, the same outfit that's behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sydney-sweeney-starring-split-fiction-movie-from-deadpool-writers-gets-a-key-update/1100-6531988/" data-ref-id="1100-6531988">Split Fiction movie starring Sydney Sweeney.</a></p>

Dbrand sent a sample to GameSpot, but since I don't have the console yet, I've only been able to hold it on its own. I can say that the ergonomics of the Joy-Con 2 grip attachments are excellent on their own; it feels natural to hold, and the build quality seems great.</p><p>Let's take a look at the Killswitch's features and the customization options you can pick from.

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killswitch Grip</a> adds ergonomic handles to the Switch 2's Joy-Con Controllers as well as an impact-resistant shell to protect the console from accidental drops. The Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch has a three-piece design that allows you to remove each Joy-Con 2 Controller without the need to remove the textured grips.</p><p>Like other Killswitch grips from Dbrand, the handles have a firm, rubberized feel. The handles are uniquely shaped with a contoured ridge to rest your middle fingers on. The low-profile case covers the back of the console without adding bulk to the top or sides; the casing extends up 2.5mm on the top and sides of the Switch 2. All of the ports are accessible with the case attached, and the console's built-in kickstand can still be used.</p><p>The only caveat here is that, unless you remove the Killswitch, you'll need to use an adapter to dock the console for TV mode. That said, Dbrand is bundling the custom dock adapter stand with the grip.</p><p>Pricing for the Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch starts at $60. At the base tier, you'll get the grip case, dock adapter, and a console skin.</p><p>Dbrand is offering discounts for the higher-priced configurations. The Travel package costs $79.85 (was $99.85) and comes with a front case that protects the Switch 2's display and buttons, sticks, and triggers while on the go. With the front cover attached, the Killswitch will fully replace a traditional carrying case. This tier also includes a 10-card game case that attaches to the inside of the travel cover, as well as textured thumbstick grips.</p><p>The Ultra package is now $99.80 (was $134.80) and includes everything from the Travel bundle, as well as two Dbrand Prism 2.0 tempered glass screen protectors with an auto-alignment application kit. You'll also get an extra game card holder.</p><p>Each of the add-on components is available to purchase separately, but the bundles offer better value. For instance, the travel cover with a game card holder is a $25 (was $30) add-on. Two screen protectors cost $30 (was $35). Meanwhile, the stick grips are $10, and an extra game card holder is $15--though you won't want that last one unless you get the travel cover.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604"></a><figcaption>Dbrand Nintendo Switch 2 Killswitch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Week Restocks - Here's What We Know So Far</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set Is Only $146 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
