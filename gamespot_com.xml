                <p>The latest Pokemon event at GameStop hasn't gone as many would like, to say the least. The retailer distributed physical cards containing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-free-shiny-koraidon-and-miraidon-in-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/1100-6534715/" data-ref-id="1100-6534715">codes for Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon</a> to be redeemed in Pokemon Scarlet and Violet beginning September 26. But after the well of codes quickly ran dry, GameStop announced that a second wave of codes arrived this past weekend, albeit with a catch.</p><p>GameStop has approximately 50 codes per store, according to a statement on X. These codes will be printed on receipts instead of the usual cards with unique art. The statement emphasizes the limited nature of this second round, adding that the retailer is committed to distributing every code it receives and providing more if The Pokemon Company makes them available.</p><p>This event has drawn outcry from Pokemon fans, who point out the scarcity of the codes and the prevalence of scalpers on platforms such as eBay who are selling code distribution cards. Many also believe that 50 codes per store is still not enough to meet demand. GameStop appeared to shift blame toward The Pokemon Company, responding to complaints of the limited supply by tersely <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974637403609718984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stating on X</a>: "Not our decision."</p><p>According to GameStop's initial <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974565308112445874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement of the additional codes</a>, the company "bugged" The Pokemon Company for them until the company "gave in." The Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon event is scheduled to end on October 15.</p><p>Some distribution events for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet have utilized the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-how-to-get-these-shiny-legendary-pokemon/1100-6533355/" data-ref-id="1100-6533355">games' Mystery Gift feature</a>, which allows players to claim items or Pokemon. Mystery Gift only requires an internet connection to receive any gifts and doesn't require any codes, let alone codes that players must obtain in physical form.</p><p>Next up for the franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, which releases on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16. The action RPG will also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-paid-dlc-and-two-shocking-new-mega-evolutions/1100-6534700/" data-ref-id="1100-6534700">receive post-launch DLC</a>, along with its own distribution events in the future. Here's hoping that those ones go a lot smoother.</p>
