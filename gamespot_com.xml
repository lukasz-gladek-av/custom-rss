                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed April's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting April 1 - <strong>RoboCop: Rogue City</strong>, <strong>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</strong>, and <strong>Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-march-2025/1100-6529662/" data-ref-id="1100-6529662">March's PlayStation Plus free games yet</a>, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/robocop-rogue-city/" data-ref-id="5000-534157">RoboCop: Rogue City</a> is a surprisingly faithful trip to Old Detroit. While it has moments of tedium and meandering between missions, it more than makes up for it with its action. From ricocheting bullets off of surfaces to bulldozing your way through squishy enemies, the game looks and feels like an authentic slice of RoboCop action. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-expansion-will-let-you-play-as-the-fleshy-version-of-the-ultimate-cop/1100-6529938/" data-ref-id="1100-6529938">With a standalone expansion on the way</a>, this is also a great time to enforce Murphy's law before it arrives.</p><p dir="ltr">Sticking with screen-accurate adaptations, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-chain-saw-massacre-devs-on-best-horror-games-their-games-final-girl-and-texas-chainsaw-2-hopes/1100-6518770/" data-ref-id="1100-6518770">one of our favorite asymmetrical horror experiences</a> based on a cult-classic slasher film. While similar games feature a team of players working together to survive a run-in with a nigh-unstoppable Hollywood monster, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre flips the script on its head by throwing Leatherface and his family of cannibals at a group of potential victims.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth/" data-ref-id="5000-239106">Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory</a> will see you step into the gumshoes of Keisuke Amazawa, who has been accused of a crime he didn't commit. Diving into the Digital World of Digimon, Amazawa joins a group of hackers to uncover the mysteries plaguing the land and possibly find the real culprit behind the crime he was falsely accused of.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus Free Games for April 2025</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4465883-ps-plus-april-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465883" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4465883-ps-plus-april-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465883"></a><figcaption>PS Plus April 2025 games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4465883-ps-plus-april-2025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><i>Available April 1 until May 5</i></p><ul><li dir="ltr">RoboCop: Rogue City</li><li dir="ltr">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</li><li dir="ltr">Digimon Story Cyber Sleuth: Hacker's Memory</li></ul>

                <p>Square Enix has announced that War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius will be shutting down on May 30.</p><p>"Since War of the Visions: Final Fantasay Brave Exvius's launch on March 25, 2020, we've strived to provide an enjoyable gaming experience for our players every day that could exceed the day before," Square Enix said in a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "However, we've come to the conclusion that it would be difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience, and therefore to discontinue the app service."</p><p>An end-of-service roadmap was also provided. Players are now no longer able to purchase Visiore using real-world currency. However, any currently held Visiore can still be used until the game shuts down. Visiore is the game's premium currency that let players summon units, purchase items from the shop, and replenish NRG. Special Shop sales have ended too.</p><p>Any in-game events that have already been scheduled will be held until the game's end of service. Android players have until April 30 to exchange their Google Play points for items.</p><p>War of the Visions is yet another Final Fantasy mobile game that's shutting down.

This game is not to be confused with War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius, as War of the Visions is a spin-off of Final Fantasy Brave Exvius.</p><p>Square Enix also suddenly ended support for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/support-for-this-final-fantasy-game-has-suddenly-ended-on-ios/1100-6529503/" data-ref-id="1100-6529503">iOS version of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles</a> due to a change in the version's in-app purchase model.</p>
