                <p>Nintendo has said that Switch 2's eShop won't have any theme music, just like the first Switch didn't, as a result of not wanting to disrupt the user experience.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said, "Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games." Before the Switch, systems like Wii and Wii U had music themes playing as users browsed their respective eShops. "We didn’t want to intrude on that, so we don’t have music there."</p><p>Kawamoto added that he wanted to make sure that browsing the Switch 2 eShop was a smooth experience, that the list doesn't stall, and that pages load fast. Due to those factors, the eShop won't have any theme music.</p><p>He also admitted that he booted up the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any other application on the Wii system. The Wii Shopping channel is known for its catchy theme, and it's so popular that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-labo-players-cover-wii-shop-music-and-bil/1100-6458475/" data-ref-id="1100-6458475">players created covers of it in Nintendo Labo</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, some Nintendo Labo kits are one of the few games that aren't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatible</a> on Switch 2. More specifically, it's the Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This kit requires players to insert the Switch tablet into the Toy-Con device. Since the Switch 2 tablet is larger than the original Switch, it won't fit.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Direct</a> last week, tons of new info dropped.

                <p>Artificial intelligence remains one of the biggest talking points in video games and many other industries, and now Nintendo of America's president has weighed in to share his thoughts.</p><p>Doug Bowser told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/nintendo-president-on-the-new-switch-2-tariffs-and-whats-next.html?jwsource=cl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> that he sees opportunities for AI technologies to enhance productivity in some areas, but when it comes to actual game development, humans will always lead the way.</p><p>"If developers choose to use AI--and it is a discussion right now at Nintendo--it's not the only method of developing games," he said. "We still believe that what makes our games special is our developers. Their artistic capabilities. Their insight into how people play. So there is always, always going to be a human touch and a human engagement in how we develop and build our games."</p><p>He added that AI is no different than any other new technology that's come onto the market, saying Nintendo might choose to leverage it if it helps to create "a better gameplay experience."</p><p>It appears Nintendo's executives are aligned in their messaging on this subject, as Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Looking outside Nintendo, Electronic Arts boss Andrew Wilson believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-drive-microtransaction-sales-help-games-get-made-faster-no-comment-on-human-impact/1100-6521669/" data-ref-id="1100-6521669">AI could be used to develop games more quickly</a>. Microsoft, meanwhile, is heavily invested in AI and has said AI will be featured in every product it makes going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exec-believes-ai-will-be-a-major-inflection-point-for-gaming-but-says-nothing-about-human-impact/1100-6519555/" data-ref-id="1100-6519555">including Xbox</a>, and Ubisoft plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-trying-to-make-ai-npcs-that-have-real-conversations/1100-6521970/" data-ref-id="1100-6521970">create AI NPCs that players can have conversations with</a>.</p><p>AI technology has been used in game development for decades--but what's new and different in recent years is what's referred to as generative artificial intelligence. Many remain concerned that growth of the generative AI market could lead to job losses, and companies like EA and others have admitted this is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">legitimate concern</a>.</p><p>The video game industry has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">faced brutal layoffs in 2023 and 2024</a>, though what role advances to artificial intelligence technologies has had on these cuts is unknown.</p><p>In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> launches in June. The price point was announced at $450, but some believe Nintendo will end up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">raising prices due to newly announced tariffs. </a></p>

Eventually, they take control of an array of orbital defense satellites and rule the planet below with an iron fist. What follows is a series of intense mech battles as the warring factions fight for control of the world.</p><p>You can customize your Arsenal (mech) and explore Titanic Scion's open world solo or alongside up to two friends in the online cooperative mode. The sequel has been pitched as a standalone experience, so you don't need to play the original before diving in. That said, it is worth checking out regardless.

                <p>Grammy-winning artist Sabrina Carpenter is on her way to Fortnite with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">skins, music packs, and more</a>. Officially announced in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/sabrina-carpenter-hearts-fortnite-festival-in-season-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on the Fortnite website, the artist will headline Fortnite Festival Season 8 as this season's Icon, beginning on April 8.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Festival is sort of like a Rock Band-like game mode that lives within Fortnite and lets up to four players perform together online. Carpenter is the latest of Festival Icons joining Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-season-4-adds-lots-of-metallica-and-a-pvp-mode/1100-6524173/" data-ref-id="1100-6524173">Metallica</a>.</p><p>"I've always found it exciting for fans to be able to interact and engage with music through different art forms and to interact in a way that’s genuinely fun," Carpenter told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/sabrina-carpenter-fortnite-headliner-1235311131/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a> in a statement. "So, for the fans that haven't been able to come to the tour, or to any new fans, this is such a special way to still be a part of Short n' Sweet world."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4471959"></a><figcaption>Give your game a shot of Espresso with these looks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4471959-1%288%29.jpg"></figure><p>By unlocking the Season Eight Music Pass, players can access a ton of new Carpenter-inspired content, including new Jam Tracks "Juno" and "Nonsense," which are fully playable as performances with others in Festival. Of course, the biggest selling point is the ability to play as Sabrina herself, who comes with two skins (each with two color variations) based on outfits from her recent Short n’ Sweet tour.</p><p>To purchase the music pass, Fortnite players need 1,400 V-Bucks (roughly $13). After that, players will immediately unlock the yellow babydoll Sabrina Carpenter Outfit--with an included Lego Style. The outfit resembles the one she wore on her most recent tour. At the end of the pass, players will receive a similar bodysuit, another look from her tour.</p><p>One of the bigger changes coming this season will be the renaming of Fortnite emotes; all of those that include dancing will now be aptly called dance emotes in the Locker. While using a dance emote, any player can do the same dance with you--even if they don't own the emote. There will be two Sabrina-inspired dance emotes this season: the Taste Emote and the Please Please Please Emote, which are each choreographed to the song they're tied to.</p><p>As the season progresses, players can unlock more Sabrina goodies like a skirt and boots inspired by another tour look. This has a pink default Style, a Baby Blue alt Style, and another Lego version. There will also be a matching lipstick-stained purse with both pink and blue stylings. Lastly, customizations like her own Battle Bus contrail and microphone.</p><p>Since launching in late 2023, Fortnite Festival has been bringing in a new headlining artist every three months or so. The current season is headlined by virtual pop star <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-details-for-fortnite-x-hatsune-miku-finally-revealed/1100-6528770/" data-ref-id="1100-6528770">Hatsune Miku</a>. </p>
