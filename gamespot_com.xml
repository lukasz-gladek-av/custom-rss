                <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it's partnering with Star Wars and Star Trek director JJ Abrams' video game company, Bad Robot Games, to produce and publish a new co-op shooter from Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth.</p><p>The unannounced four-player co-op shooter is being directed by Booth and is coming to PS5 and PC at some point in the future. No further details were announced, nor were any images released.</p><p>Bad Robot Games CEO Anna Sweet said, "We hope to deliver a bold, innovative experience that is truly special for players. I could not be more excited that Mike Booth is at the creative helm, crafting a cooperative adventure that will lead to unforgettable moments with friends."</p><p>Sony's Christian Svensson, meanwhile, said Bad Robot's "unique creative voice and passion" for innovation "perfectly aligns with SIE's mission to craft experiences that resonate deeply with players."</p><p>In 2021, Bad Robot Games announced that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-director-jj-abrams-gaming-studio-raises-40-million-working-on-aaa-new-ip/1100-6491684/" data-ref-id="1100-6491684">raised $40 million and was working on a AAA new IP.</a> The division was founded in 2018 with the help of Tencent and Warner Bros. Games.</p><p>Abrams was previously working with Epic on a game called Spyjinx, but it has vanished.</p>

                <p>Developer Neon Giant has teased an announcement on December 11, the same day as The Game Awards, for a project that the team is calling "ludicrously ambitious." That's some bonafide marketing hype, and the Swedish developer isn't revealing much more beyond that the game will focus on "player agency."</p><p>The developer added that the game will be set in a "reactive" world where "player agency and creativity" are two defining elements. It's "the kind of game that every developer wants to work on," the developer said in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-called-its-first-cyberpunk-setting-cooler-than-night-city-and-now-the-studio-behind-the-ascent-says-its-making-the-kind-of-game-that-every-developer-wants-to-work-on/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer.</a></p><p>Neon Giant previously made The Ascent, and after that game's success, studio co-founder Arcade Berg said the studio could have "asked for nearly anything" from the publishers that came calling.</p><p>Neon Giant was sold in 2022 to South Korean gaming company Krafton, the publisher of PUBG, and Berg said he and co-founder Tor Frick took the deal because they "didn't start a studio to run a studio."</p><p>"We started [Neon Giant] because we wanted to make games in a certain way," Berg said. "That's the only thing that's really important to us. So we said, well, you know what? Why not? Why not find someone to work with so we can get the rocket fuel that we feel that we need to be even more ambitious, and also feel that we have some stability, we can have the courage and afford to take risks, creative risks and project risks, because we think that will lead to a frankly cooler product in the end."</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, and GameSpot will bring you all the news and reveals as they happen.

                <p dir="ltr">With a planned release in the next few months, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/">The Game Awards</a> seems like a fitting stage to reintroduce the long-gestating Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake. But that's not part of Ubisoft's plans, according to the Prince of Persia account <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The official social media channel poured cold water on a fan account speculating that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will show up at The Game Awards on December 11. "Sorry to disappoint but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at [The Game Awards] this year," the Prince of Persia account states.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sorry to disappoint, but can confirm Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time won't be at TGA this year 💖</p>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1996323369080250412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In June, Ubisoft noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-once-again-promises-that-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-on-the-way/1100-6532466/">the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake is set to launch by March 31</a>--the end of the company's current fiscal year. That was the second time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/">Ubisoft stuck to that release timeline</a>, too. However, it's been a bumpy road for the game since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-revealed-dur/1100-6482030/">being announced in 2020</a>. For instance, in 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-changes-developers/1100-6503046/" data-ref-id="1100-6503046">the Prince of Persia remake switched developers to Ubisoft Montreal</a>, the original team behind the Sands of Time series. Before that, Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai were working on the title.</p><p dir="ltr">The original Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time released in 2003 on PC, PS2, GameCube, and Xbox. From a marketing perspective, Ubisoft might want to focus on The Rogue Prince of Persia, as <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1996263159556878586" rel="nofollow ">it's coming to Switch and Switch 2</a> on December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, there are other questions swirling around The Game Awards. The biggest one relates to a statue that showed up in a desert, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">people guessing the teaser relates to Diablo 4 or a new God of War</a>. However, there's been pushback that neither is correct.</p>
