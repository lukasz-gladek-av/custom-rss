                <p>The third volume in Udon Entertainment's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHQB8MYD?binding=hardcover&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Elden Ring art book series</a> is launching on November 4, and this new entry is all about the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Shadow of the Erdtree added multiple massive new open world locations, dungeons, and dozens of bosses to the already enormous action RPG--enough content that it could have easily been its own standalone game--so it's no surprise that the expansion is getting its own dedicated art book.</p><p>If you're looking to add it to your collection, you can preorder <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/177294405X?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring: Official Art Book Volume III</a> at Amazon now. Preorders are even slightly discounted to just $55.79, saving you a few dollars off its $60 launch price. And thanks to Amazon's preorder price guarantee, if that drops any further, you'll only pay the lowest price once your order ships.</p><p>We've detailed the new art book below, and included information about the previous two volumes as well in case you're curious about the full series.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/" data-ref-id="5000-489022">Diablo Immortal</a> is crossing over with Blizzard's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hearthstone-heroes-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-176391">Hearthstone</a> for a new event where players can wield the effects of some of the trading card game's most iconic cards, but many players are more focused on what they believe is AI art being used to promote the crossover.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24226323/collect-iconic-hearthstone-cards-in-heroes-of-the-hearth" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hearthstone event in Diablo Immortal</a> will run from July 30 to August 27, with players able to acquire 18 abilities based on Hearthstone cards like Polymorph, Ice Block, Windfury, Flame Imp, Holy Nova, and more. These cards activate new powers in Diablo Immortal's Enchanted Planes and Trial of the Hearth game modes. There is also a new Legendary gem, the Manaflux gem, that is inspired by Hearthstone's mana mechanic. It builds mana stacks over time, after which using a skill will play a Hearthstone card like Ragnaros or Acidic Swamp Ooze to decimate enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">While players who want to collect all the cards will need to purchase card packs, Blizzard is giving away some freebies in the form of a promo code (CARDCOLLECT) that can be used to acquire a random card and various other items like gems and crests. Players who login to Diablo Immortal with a character level 10 or higher during the event will also unlock an exclusive Hearthstone card back.</p><p dir="ltr">The event will additionally add new Warcraft-inspired pets like the Core Rager and Lil' Ragnaros, as well as character skins based on Azeroth's most famous power couple, Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind. It's not the first time Diablo Immortal has crossed over with the Warcraft universe, with a previous crossover event adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-getting-a-lich-king-boss-battle-for-wows-20th-anniversary/1100-6527585/" data-ref-id="1100-6527585">Lich King as a boss battle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the leadup to the event's launch, fans over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>) noticed the piece of artwork teasing the Diablo Immortal and Hearthstone crossover looked off. That quickly led to accusations that Blizzard, or perhaps Diablo Immortal's co-developer NetEase, had used generative AI to create the artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">The artwork features a Night Elf (presumably Tyrande) sitting across a tavern table and playing cards, and there are some noticeable oddities. Tyrande's necklace appears to be somewhat melted, the Hearthstone cards look wrong, pieces of toast are just sitting on a table in an odd manner, and the human card player's ear is malformed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not addressed the situation, but it's not the first time it's been accused of using AI art in Hearthstone. Last year the studio <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/blizzard-is-investigating-claims-that-upcoming-hearthstone-hero-skins-are-ai-generated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">investigated</a> claims that a batch of upcoming Hearthstone-hero skins were made using AI, and while Blizzard didn't confirm that they were, it did end up removing the skins in question.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal recently added new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-putting-a-new-spin-on-a-classic-diablo-class/1100-6532742/" data-ref-id="1100-6532742">spin on a classic Diablo class</a>, the Druid.

<p dir="ltr">One of the issues the game has experienced so far is related to preorder bonuses, as an update released on July 25 did not properly distribute these bonuses to all players. As compensation for this, those who own the deluxe-edition of the game on Steam will be getting three extra sets of deluxe costumes and four weapons, and both standard- and deluxe-edition owners will get three headgear items on all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the game's performance and optimization issues, Leenzee explained that it will "continue to optimize performance issues and will keep adjusting the game based on your suggestions--such as difficulty levels and boss encounters--in upcoming patches." It outlined a preview of some of its "recent optimization efforts," which include things like crash fixes, improved frame rates and reduced lag on certain graphics cards, improved AI logic for monsters and bosses, enhanced texture quality in low-resolution areas, and improved asset detail and precision in some regions.</p><p dir="ltr">Leenzee closed out the post by asking "for your patience as we tackle these optimizations step by step."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious as to whether the game is worth checking out despite these performance issues, check out or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-aint-nuthing-ta-pluck-with/1900-6418385/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a>.</p>
