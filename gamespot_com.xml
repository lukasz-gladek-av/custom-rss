                <p>Warhorse Studios has announced that hardcore mode will come to Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 next week. The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>

                <p>Nitrome, the developer behind Shovel Knight Dig, has announced a new game called Mouse Work. It is exclusively built around the use of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-joy-cons-have-mouse-like-functionality/1100-6530529/" data-ref-id="1100-6530529">Nintendo Switch 2's mouse controls</a>.</p><p>Mouse Work really embraces the "mouse" idea. It's a party game in which players use Joy-Con 2s in mouse mode to control mice and complete minigames. We see a few of these minigames in action in its debut trailer, such as ones where players pick up and stack boxes, paint the lines that appear on a canvas, close annoying pop-up ads on a PC desktop, shoot asteroids in space, guide rock climbers up a wall, and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdhvAqS4bjA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RdhvAqS4bjA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Mouse Work, each of these minigames is billed as a job that players must complete to earn Cheddar, the game's in-game currency. Players can then use Cheddar to buy new cosmetics for the mouse cursors that players control. The official description reveals that the whole game can be played in either solo or co-op. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/part-time-ufo/" data-ref-id="5000-479012">Part-Time UFO</a> is the title that most immediately comes to mind as a comparable game.</p><p>Mouse Work is notable for being the first built-for-Switch-2 indie game announced in the wake of the system's reveal last week. It fills the same niche as a game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together/" data-ref-id="5000-461292">Snipperclips: Cut It Out Together!</a> as a kid-friendly, cooperative launch window game where players can get a grip on one of the Nintendo system's core hardware concepts. Where Snipperclips emphasized easy cooperative play, Mouse Work takes advantage of the mouse capabilities of the Joy-Con 2 controllers.</p><p>Nitrome has yet to confirm a release date for Mouse Work, simply saying that it "will release hot on the tail of the Nintendo Switch 2." The new system will come out on June 5 with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch lineup</a> that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> 11.1.5 update is landing April 22, and with it new features like a boss rush mode and the return of Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions. However, what players are perhaps most excited about is that the update will finally bake in a UI alternative to one of the game's most popular (and, in the opinion of many WoW players, required) add-ons.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24186695/patch-1115-arrives-on-april-22" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, patch 11.1.5 will officially add the Cooldown Manager to the game's customizable UI, giving players far more control over tracking their character's various abilities and buffs. Players will be able to better track their utility cooldowns with a special bar, see easy-to-read meters showing the time remaining on buffs, and more easily watch out for the essential abilities coming off cooldown. It's something the game's default UI has been sorely missing for quite some time, resulting in players turning to free third-party add-ons to meet their needs, specifically an add-on called WeakAuras.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The 11.1.5 Content Update goes live April 22!<br>🕷️ Nightfall campaign<br>📊 Cooldown Manager UI Update<br>✨ Winds of Mysterious Fortune Leveling Event<br>🔮 Horrific Visions Revisited - May 20<br>⚔️ Dastardly Duos Event - June 3 <a href="https://t.co/HTgj7RHHbo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HTgj7RHHbo</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1909652467798712806?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While the Cooldown Manager won't offer quite as much granular customization as WeakAuras (which can get very complex), it does offer much of the basic functionality and benefits of the add-on, minus all the hassle. It's not the first time Blizzard has sought to improve its UI and make it so add-ons feel like less of a requirement. As part of the game's Dragonflight expansion, Blizzard dramatically overhauled the MMORPG's UI and introduced far more customization to it than ever before, significantly reducing the need for players to install popular UI add-ons like Bartender. Over time, Blizzard has continued to update the UI to make it far more usable right out of the box.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt many players will still use WeakAuras due to how highly customizable it is, but for players who are more casual and don't feel like spending hours setting up WeakAuras for each of their characters, the default Cooldown Manager will be a great alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">As for actual content coming as part of 11.1.5, things will kick off on April 22 with a new scenario and quests revolving around the Flame's Radiance, a new Renown faction that will see players defending Hallowfall from invading Sureki forces. In addition to new cosmetics and a tabard that will change visually as players rise through the Renown ranks, players will also unlock buffs that will make them stronger while in Hallowfall and Azj-Kahet. A leveling event that will grant 20% more XP, as well as a hefty Renown reputation buff for Dragonflight and The War Within factions, will also begin April 22.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle for Azeroth's Horrific Visions feature will return on May 20, allowing players to once again battle through Old God corrupted versions of Stormwind and Orgrimmar to earn not only up to Heroic level gear but also new cosmetics and enchants. Then on June 3, Blizzard will introduce a new feature called Dastardly Duos, a boss rush-style mode that will see players battling against two or more bosses from the game's past at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">WoW's 11.1 update, Undermine(d)</a>, released February 21 and saw players travel to the fabled goblin city, though the Race to World First to clear the Mythic difficulty of the game's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-exploiters-cleared-new-mythic-raid-first-using-grey-items-got-banned-and-then-did-it-again/1100-6530118/" data-ref-id="1100-6530118">Liberation of Undermine raid was disrupted by a group of exploiters</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/">Metal Gear</a>'s grim and competent special ops protagonist Solid Snake was only grim and quiet thanks to strict tech limitations restricting what his creator, Hideo Kojima, could do with him. Kojima made the comments in a recent interview with Japanese magazine An-An (which <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/metal-gear-solid-snakes-silent-tough-guy-personality-was-influenced-by-technical-limitations-of-the-first-game-kojima-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton </a>translated) and said the severe hardware restrictions of the MSX2, which Metal Gear first released on, meant he couldn't get too ambitious with his new creation's emotional profile.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was 1986 when I entered the game industry," Kojima said. "Games still couldn’t speak. Characters did not have voices. Kanji fonts weren’t supported, and you could only show one katakana character at a time. Solid Snake, the protagonist of my debut title Metal Gear (1987), was born as a silent ‘tough guy’ because of these circumstances."</p><p dir="ltr">Those circumstances had changed by the time Kojima and Konami developed Metal Gear Solid in 1998, when Snake had a voice actor and more things to say. However, by that point, Kojima had made Solid Snake's stoic gruffness part of the character's personality. He said he envisioned Snake as a character similar to James Bond or Lupin the Third, delivering "snappy lines" when the situation called for them. Kojima also said he attributed much of the character's popularity to David Hayter's voice work in the English version and Akio Otsuka's in the Japanese release.</p><p dir="ltr">Hayter reprised his role as Solid Snake (and sometimes Big Boss) in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, The Twin Snakes, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, and Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, along with a few spin-offs. While his personality remained largely the same, Konami experimented with a more involved role for Snake over the years, with Snake being rather chatty in some games and unusually reticent in others, such as Metal Gear Solid V. However, Kiefer Sutherland voiced Solid Snake in that game.</p><p dir="ltr">His personality in the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake won't change, though--at least in the main campaign. Konami confirmed that the studio is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/30/23742786/metal-gear-solid-delta-3-snake-eater-remake-voice-actors-no-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-using Metal Gear Solid 3's original voice track</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid 3: Delta</a>. Hayter, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gears-david-hayter-seemingly-teasing-new-performance-as-snake/1100-6526906/" data-ref-id="1100-6526906">teased new voice work in October 2024</a>, though whether it's for a new Metal Gear game or some sneaky new additions to Metal Gear Solid 3 is anyone's guess.</p>
