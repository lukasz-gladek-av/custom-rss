                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a> debuted last summer shortly before the start of the current NFL season, so it's fitting that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-revealed-for-february-2025-including-starfield-for-standard-tier/2900-6219/" data-ref-id="2900-6219">arrived on Game Pass today</a> before the end of the post-season. That means Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers can run their own Super Bowl simulations before the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles meet again on Sunday.</p><p>EA has traditionally released its Madden NFL Super Bowl predictions ahead of the game, but the publisher has yet to do so this year. Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-super-bowl-predictions-over-the-years-how-often-does-ea-get-it-right/1100-6487137/" data-ref-id="1100-6487137">Madden NFL's Super Bowl projections</a> have only been right six out of the last 13 years, which gives it a 46% accuracy rating. Some years are closer than others, but Madden NFL successfully picked the exact score for Super Bowl 49 before the New England Patriots downed the Seattle Seahawks 28-24.</p><p>You may have noticed that the cover athlete for Madden NFL 25--Christian McCaffrey--doesn't play for either the Chiefs or the Eagles. Instead, McCaffrey is a running back for the San Francisco 49ers who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-25-cover-athlete-christian-mccaffrey-injured-will-miss-4-games/1100-6526490/" data-ref-id="1100-6526490">spent some time on the injured list</a> this year, reviving talk about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-bowl-2020-patrick-mahomes-and-the-madden-cur/1100-6473047/" data-ref-id="1100-6473047">the infamous Madden curse</a>. The reality is that football is a physically taxing sport, and almost every player deals with injuries at some point. That hasn't stopped Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase from proclaiming that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfls-best-wide-receiver-is-aware-of-madden-curse-doesnt-want-to-be-cover-star/1100-6528594/" data-ref-id="1100-6528594">he's aware of the so-called curse</a>, and doesn't want to be a Madden NFL cover star.</p><p>Madden NFL 26 will likely arrive this summer, but it has yet to receive an official announcement from EA. Although it's been 13 years since Madden appeared on a Nintendo console, EA is very optimistic about the franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/" data-ref-id="1100-6529253">making a comeback on Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from The Outer Worlds developer Obsidian, is capable of running at up to 60fps on Xbox Series X, game director Carrie Patel has confirmed.</p><p>Patel said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAtStowg2Rk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, "You can get up to 60[fps]" on Xbox Series X. The use of "can" here might indicate an alternative graphics mode that prioritizes image quality over frame rate, but we don't know for sure as of yet.</p><p>The frame rate reaching 60fps on Series X is newsworthy in part because Obsidian previously said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-will-be-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-allowing-for-juicier-visual-effects/1100-6526077/" data-ref-id="1100-6526077">only capable of reaching 30fps on Xbox Series X.</a> Obsidian said this decision was made early on in the development of the game and has allowed the studio to get "a lot juicier" with visual effects. Things have changed since then, though, and Avowed can now run at a higher frame rate on Series X.</p><p>Patel also told fans to expect some amount of bugs and issues. "You gotta accept a little jank to do something fun and creative, I think," Patel said.</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>Avowed is Obsidian's first new release since 2022's Pentiment. It's not Obsidian's only in-development project, either, as the studio is also making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.</p><p>For more, be sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-steelbook-premium-edition-is-up-for-preorder-comes-with-five-day-early-access/1100-6527801/" data-ref-id="1100-6527801">Avowed preorder guide.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For the first week of each Content Commissioner takeover, players will "chase glory together to complete Community challenges and ultimately determine how many Apex Packs will be up for grabs the following week," according to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/takeover-game-updates" rel="nofollow ">a new blog post</a> on the official Apex Legends website.</p><p dir="ltr">The community goals for the first week of each takeover are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 1 challenges:</strong> 10 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 2 challenges:</strong> 15 Apex Packs earnable</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete Tier 3 challenges:</strong> 20 Apex Packs earnable</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The second week of each takeover is when players will get a chance to earn those Apex Packs. Players will be faced with five in-game challenges. Players who complete all five will gain access to the Apex Packs they unlocked during the previous week, along with a special Creator Commissioner-selected Legendary-tier weapon skin.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also earn a free banner frame via Twitch Drops if they tune in to a Twitch stream from an approved Apex Legends content creator. A free Creator Commissioner-themed stat tracker will be available for players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-send-gifts-in-apex-legends/1100-6508429/">gift to their friends</a> via the in-game store.</p><p dir="ltr">The Apex Legends Season 24 Creator Commissioners schedule--and the Legendary-tier skins they've chosen for their two-week time in the spotlight--are listed below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 25 - March 10:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ninjayla">Ninjayla</a> (Legendary skin: Death Ray Wingman)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>March 11 - 24:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/oraxe">Oraxe</a> (Legendary skin: The Pioneer Kraber)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>April 1 - 14:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/apryze">Apryze</a> (Legendary skin: Bone Breaker Mastiff)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>April 15 - 28:</strong> <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaminariqpi/">Kaminari Qpi</a> (Legendary skin: Tombstick Mastiff)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Respawn hasn't yet announced which limited-time modes will be available during the Creator Commissioner takeovers, though more information is likely to be shared when the Season 24 patch notes are released. The trailer did mention that both Ash and Ballistic were buffed, and details on those changes will also be available once patch notes are live.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also gave players a glimpse of the game's new Arsenals: special Loot Bins available in battle royale mode that include a weapon, ammo for that weapon, and a special attachment or hop-up for that weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 24: Takeover begins on Tuesday, February 11 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NASA will be hosting its first-ever Twitch stream from the International Space Station (ISS) next week. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration made the announcement via its official X (formerly Twitter) account, and shared some details on what viewers can expect from the stream.</p><p dir="ltr">"This Twitch event from space is the first of many," said Brittany Brown, who directs NASA's Office of Communications Digital and Technology Division. "We spoke with digital creators at TwitchCon about their desire for streams designed with their communities in mind, and we listened. In addition to our spacewalks, launches, and landings, we’ll host more Twitch-exclusive streams like this one. Twitch is one of the many digital platforms we use to reach new audiences and get them excited about all things space."</p><p>The stream itself will take place on the ISS--roughly 250 miles above Earth's surface--and will feature appearances from NASA astronauts Don Pettit (who is currently aboard the ISS) and Matt Dominick (who recently returned to Earth after participating in NASA's Crew-8 mission). The spacefaring duo will discuss topics like daily life aboard the ISS and the microgravity experiments currently being performed on board, while also highlighting "ways for Twitch users to engage with NASA, including citizen science projects and science, technology, engineering, and math programs designed to inspire the Artemis Generation."</p><p dir="ltr">The Artemis Generation refers to the astronauts who will explore Earth's moon as a part of NASA's Artemis Program.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon," the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/artemis/" rel="nofollow ">official Artemis Program website</a> reads. "NASA will land the first woman, first person of color, and first international partner astronaut on the Moon using innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before."</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time NASA has conducted a Twitch livestream, nor is it the first time the agency has broadcast a livestream from the ISS. But according to the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-goes-live-first-twitch-stream-from-space-station/" rel="nofollow ">official NASA website</a>, "This conversation will be the first NASA event [livestreamed] from the International Space Station developed specifically for the agency’s Twitch platform."</p><p>The stream will take place on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa">NASA's Twitch channel</a> on Wednesday, February 12 at 8:45 AM PT / 11:45 AM ET.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> may be a work of art, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6528863/" data-ref-id="1100-6528863">Patch 8</a> remains a work in progress. A select group of players were invited to take part in Larian Studios' stress test for Patch 8, which is still ongoing. However, Larian has already put together an update that addresses some of the bugs that have been uncovered in Patch 8.</p><p>As laid out in <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/stress-test-update-1_135" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new post by Larian Studios</a>, there don't appear to be any game-breaking bugs in Patch 8. But there are issues that have come up in several areas, including the newly added Photo Mode. Now, creatures will supposedly obey the "look at the camera" command, and dragonborn won't lose their tails in the pictures. </p><p>Cross-play is another big addition of Patch 8, which is meant to connect players from consoles and PCs. This update only has a small number of fixes, but Larian notes that "we are still investigating instances of cross-play not working as intended." Other changes are meant to smooth out unintended effects, including an "issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit."</p><p>Patch 8 Update 1 is expected to go live later today, but only for Baldur's Gate 3 players who were invited to take part in the stress test. Everyone else will get the complete Patch 8 after it receives refinement from Larian. After Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio will turn its full attention to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Baldur's Gate 3 is almost certainly going to get a sequel, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by another studio</a>.</p><p>You can find the Patch 8 Update 1 notes below.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed containers inside inventories not scattering their contents when they get destroyed, which could potentially lead to key quest items getting lost for good.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing Oath of the Crown paladins to lose spell slots instead of gaining them when levelling up.</li><li>Fixed an issue where picking up items from the ground in multiplayer could then block movement via the controller stick.</li><li>Fixed the Wild Shape: Panther's Prowl action and Prowling condition not working correctly.</li><li>Fixed a bug where items getting added to the inventory would lose their conditions. This could cause, for example, the Elemental Cleaver buff to disappear when the imbued weapon is thrown.</li><li>Shadow Blade will now retain the behavior of being locked to the caster when upcast.</li></ul><h3>Photo Mode</h3><ul><li>Added an in-game pop-up for Photo Mode that triggers at the beach at the start of the game and can be found in the Journal.</li><li>Updated Photo Mode's screenshot function on Steam Deck so that it uses Steam's proprietary screenshot function, so you can access your photos more readily from the Steam Screenshots page.</li><li>Prevented characters from being able to pop into private cutscenes while activating Photo Mode when playing in multiplayer.</li><li>Hid the 'Toggle Photo Preview' legend while taking screenshots via Steam's screenshot function.</li><li>Fixed Photo Mode making the screen go blurry when opened on split screen.</li><li>Added camera shutter SFX when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li><li>Fixed the Attacking and Jumping poses for wolves.</li><li>Fixed a cross appearing in the middle of the screen when the Vignette is at its thickest setting.</li><li>Fixed some creatures not listening when you select the 'Look At Camera' option.</li><li>Fixed the game sometimes freezing when switching quickly between tabs in Photo Mode.</li><li>Improved the Depth of Field sliders so the strength and distance scale in proportion to the slider itself.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing dragonborn tails to appear detached from the body.</li><li>The Grasping Vine's poses now work correctly.</li></ul><h3>Cross-Play</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that could get the client stuck in a loading screen if the client unfriends the host and then clicks 'Join Party' after re-adding the host.</li><li>Fixed some of the PS5 splashscreens not showing up when they should.</li><li>Fixed a crash at the start of combat.</li></ul><h3>Subclasses</h3><ul><li>The Booming Blade tooltip now updates its values when upcast.</li><li>Fixed an inaccurate bonus value in the Rakish Audacity tooltip.</li><li>Updated Toll the Dead and Bursting Sinew to work with Potent Cantrip and deal half damage on saves.</li><li>Fixed Pact of the Blade's Extra Attack being added to Deepened Pact even if you didn't choose Pact of the Blade.</li></ul><h3>Art</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue causing the Flaming Fist armor to clip and generally freak out a bit.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Fixed a bug with Gale's donation UI preventing you from feeding him magical items.</li><li>All of the Hexblade's class actions and subclass features are now shown correctly in Character Creation.</li><li>Fixed button or keyboard shortcut inputs in the UI sometimes not working.</li><li>Fixed some Reaction tooltips like Divine Allegiance not showing some values correctly in the description.</li><li>Fixed a bug causing the UI to lock up when rapidly switching between keyboard and mouse input and controller input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where opening the Main Menu on controller wouldn't automatically select the 'Resume' option at the top of the menu.</li><li>Fixed the condition icons on the party line getting duplicated when transitioning between acts during cross-play.</li><li>Fixed some settings that were missing their wrap-around navigation functionality on controller, preventing you from looping from the last option back to the first option with the same button input.</li><li>Fixed a bug where you'd have to deselect your current passive when respeccing a character before selecting a new one. Now, you can just click the new one.</li><li>Fixed a bug that caused the toggleable Illithid Powers to disappear from the Character Sheet and be uninteractable in the Illithid Powers UI.</li><li>Fixed player avatars not showing up in the multiplayer/cross-play lobby.</li></ul><h3>Scripting</h3><ul><li>With 12 new subclasses arriving in Patch 8, we’ve rechecked some achievements, including ensuring the armed version of Stunning Strike no longer counts as an unarmed attack for the Fists of Fury achievement, and its unarmed variant now does.</li><li>Monks' Unarmed Strike bonus action now also correctly counts toward the Action Surge achievement.</li></ul><h3>Crashes</h3><ul><li>Fixed a crash when trying to start a game from a lobby multiple times.</li><li>Fixed several crashes and freezes related to the UI.</li><li>Fixed a crash on Vulkan when taking a photo in Photo Mode.</li></ul>

                <p>As part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/as-the-sims-turns-25-ea-wants-to-embrace-the-series-past/2900-6185/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6185">The Sims' 25th anniversary celebrations</a>, Maxis has announced the next expansion pack coming to The Sims 4, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/businesses-and-hobbies-expansion-pack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Businesses &amp; Hobbies</a>. After subtly teasing the upcoming release throughout its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-25th-anniversary-celebration-features-free-content-in-game-events-and-a-25-hour-stream/1100-6528814/" data-ref-id="1100-6528814">25-hour livestream</a>, the studio finally revealed an official trailer and release date earlier this morning. The expansion is currently set to release on March 6.</p><p>In a move that has been somewhat contentious with Sims fans--just check the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtroCEUo_e4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video's comments</a>--Businesses &amp; Hobbies seems to vastly expand and improve 2015's Get to Work expansion, as well as incorporate elements of The Sims 2's beloved Open for Business expansion into it. The expansion pack adds two new hobbies, tattooing and pottery-making, as well as the ability to completely own and manage various businesses and services. Though the trailer highlighted two businesses in particular--Branche Tattoo studio and a one-man pottery business--it looks as though there will be numerous goods and services sims can offer for a profit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Sims 4 Businesses &amp; Hobbies Expansion Pack | Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While the pottery-making skill seems relatively straightforward and similar to skills such as painting, baking, and knitting, the tattooing skill allows players a great deal of artistic freedom thanks to its new Paint Mode. Once in Paint Mode, players can draw, place stencils, and fine-tune colors and patterns as they imbue their sims with some sick ink.</p><p>In addition to running a tattoo parlor and pottery studio, the trailer confirmed that sims will be able to manage their own gym, own a candy shop, and operate an art gallery. The video also highlighted sims' ability to teach classes for profit, turning high-skill levels into cold, hard cash. Though a comprehensive list of businesses sims can run has yet to be announced, the variety of small business icons located in the Edit Small Business Menu seem to indicate they will be able to manage arcades, casinos, waterparks, animal shelters, bakeries, laundromats, beauty parlors, and more.</p><p>One of the most exciting aspects of Businesses &amp; Hobbies take on running a business is that your sims will be able to do so from home. Rather than having to own a separate community lot, players will now get the option to designate certain areas of their home as residential, public, or employee-only. The trailer also makes it seem as though sims will be able to pass on both their knowledge and businesses to their offspring, creating a family trade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4439933-thesims%E2%84%A24businesses%26hobbiesexpansionpack_officialrevealtrailer1-53screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4439933-thesims%E2%84%A24businesses%26hobbiesexpansionpack_officialrevealtrailer1-53screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4439933"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of Businesses &amp; Hobbies Edit Small Businesses menu.
