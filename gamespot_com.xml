                <p>Are you enjoying Avowed? Are you also a fan of growing kits? What about fungus? Well, you're in luck, because Obsidian Entertainment and North Spore have revealed that they're collaborating on a limited-edition <a href="https://northspore.com/products/organic-spray-grow-avowed-grow-kit?srsltid=AfmBOooM2qgOl4rDGozwQIj3SmWoOhSd9iP1pN-jDoVNk6v6h1a4hGSY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Avowed-themed growing kit</a>. It's set to ship out sometime later this month.</p><p>The Organic "Spray &amp; Grow" Avowed Mushroom Growing Kit is modeled after the Dreamthrall Elder Bear, an early-game boss in Avowed. In the game, the Dreamscourge disease has infected the Living Lands, and the bear has succumbed to its primal, savage urges. The infection causes organisms to sprout all over organisms, so a growing kit is certainly a thematically fitting collaboration.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446845,1300-4446844,1300-4446843,1300-4446842" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446845-image_2025-02-19_200440647.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446844-image_2025-02-19_200424519.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446843-image_2025-02-19_200316541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4446842-image_2025-02-19_200222520.jpg"></figure><p>The kit costs $30 and comes with one of three different mushrooms: blue oyster, pink oyster, or golden oyster--it's a surprise which one you'll get. According to the kit's specifications, it weighs four pounds and takes two weeks to grow. It lasts for six months and while the blue and golden oyster mushrooms can be refrigerated, the pink ones cannot be.</p><p>Xbox is no stranger to themed merchandise of its own games. While not a collaboration, Bethesda sold a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-some-out-of-this-world-sleep-with-the-starfield-duvet-cover-set/1100-6519405/" data-ref-id="1100-6519405">Starfield-themed bedding set</a> that included a navy duvet cover and two pillowcases.</p><p>Avowed is now available on PC and Xbox Series X|S, as well as Game Pass. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed review</a>, we said, "Avowed's impactful and satisfying combat is undone by a widely unbalanced upgrade system and an uninteresting story that wastes its potential."</p>

                <p>A new Pokemon Presents livestream has been confirmed for February 27 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and pocket monster fans can expect updates on new in-development projects related to the franchise. The Pokemon Company hasn't revealed any details on what will be shown exactly, but fans are expecting to see an update on the next big tentpole game in the franchise, Pokemon Legends Z-A, as well as sneak peeks at other spin-offs in the pipeline.</p><p>The Pokemon Presents livestream has become an annual tradition--these have been held every February since 2021--with additional Pokemon Presents being broadcast closer to big Pokemon game releases. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> is expected to be the main event, as it's currently scheduled for release on Switch.</p><p>We still have some burning questions for the second entry in the Pokemon Legends series, as so far, we've only seen a brief teaser trailer that heavily hinted at a return to the Kalos region that was introduced in Pokemon X and Y.</p><p>2024 was also an interesting year for the franchise, as no new mainline games or remakes were released. This is the first time since 2015 that the Pokemon series has taken a year off, as in the last decade, developer Game Freak and other studios have consistently pumped out new releases, spin-offs, and expansions.</p><p>The Pokemon Company also has numerous other franchise games that are still active, like Pokemon Go, Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket, Pokemon Unite, Pokemon Masters EX, and Pokemon Cafe, to name a few.</p>
