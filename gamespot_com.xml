For one week only, players have the ability to complete a special Satellite Hijack Contract that lets them destroy the Stadium's roof. Completing this specific contract also grants special rewards. Here we guide you through completing this multi-step contract to open Stadium's roof for yourself.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_the_Satellite_Hijack_contract">How to get the Satellite Hijack contract</a><ul><li><a href="#Find_a_contract_box">Find a contract box</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#How_to_complete_the_Satellite_Hijack_contract">How to complete the Satellite Hijack contract</a><ul><li><a href="#Get_a_decrypting_tool">Get a decrypting tool</a></li><li><a href="#Upload_to_a_relay_module">Upload to a relay module</a></li><li><a href="#Head_inside_Stadium">Head inside Stadium</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Satellite_Hijack_contract_rewards">Satellite Hijack contract rewards</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_the_Satellite_Hijack_contract">How to get the Satellite Hijack contract</h2><p dir="ltr">To blow the rooftop off of Stadium, it's going to take a few steps and a lot of teamwork. Additionally, multiple squads must complete the contract in the same match to initiate the Stadium breach. This means instead of killing every opponent you see, it's in your best interest to ignore some of the other squads around you, and let them work on their contract steps as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545950"></a><figcaption>Look for these smoke signals on the map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545950-contractsupplyboxes.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_contract_box">Find a contract box</h3><p dir="ltr">The Satellite Hijack contracts can be found randomly in boxes around the map that look like loadout drops.

Pick it up to start doing the steps.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure you're communicating with your team, because <strong>if a teammate picks up a different Warzone contract, you're blocked from picking up this Satellite Hijack contract until the other one is complete.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_complete_the_Satellite_Hijack_contract">How to complete the Satellite Hijack contract</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Get_a_decrypting_tool">Get a decrypting tool</h3><p dir="ltr">The Satellite Hijack contract will mark a large yellow satellite icon on the map.

(My squad tried to do more than one contract, but it seems like it needs to be done by different teams.)</p><p dir="ltr">Once all six satellites on the map are hacked, a laser will shoot down and destroy the center of Stadium's rooftop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545955-bo6-s05-announcement-033.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545955" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545955-bo6-s05-announcement-033.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545955"></a><figcaption>Laser shooting Stadium's rooftop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4545955-bo6-s05-announcement-033.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Head_inside_Stadium">Head inside Stadium</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll get small rewards for helping hack the satellites, but for a limited-time weapon case reward, you'll want to rush inside the Stadium. There is a giant missile at the center of Stadium's interior. It has a weapon case you can interact with for 60-seconds in order to unlock an exclusive weapon blueprint. You can use this weapon for the rest of the match, and it's permanently unlocked for you to use in your custom loadouts via the Gunsmith.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Satellite_Hijack_contract_rewards">Satellite Hijack contract rewards</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Spray</strong> - Just need to hack a satellite</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Calling card</strong> - Awarded when you successfully complete contact and Stadium roof blows up</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Weapon blueprint </strong>- Awarded by entering Stadium and interacting with the weapon case</li></ul><p dir="ltr">After the first week of Season 5, the Stadium will remain permanently open and the Satellite Hijack contract will no longer be available.</p><p dir="ltr">This event, unfortunately, requires a lot of luck, and more often than not, doesn't get completed in matches. You need to hope you have helpful people in the lobby, and even more luck that Stadium doesn't end up lost in the gas before these six satellites can be hacked.</p>

                <p>In 2023, rapper and occasional actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-brings-eminem-to-the-game-next-week-as-skins-leak/1100-6519403/" data-ref-id="1100-6519403">Eminem lent his likeness to Fortnite</a> for three different skins based on his different personas. That was just a small blip in Eminem's two-decade-plus career as an entertainer. But the rapper was recently recognized as "the guy from Fortnite."</p><p>The Eminem Bible shared the video on X, and the rapper himself had a great response. Eminem simply cracked up at the joke, and the fan immediately admitted that he was only kidding.</p><p>Eminem returned to Fortnite last year as Epic Games debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">the Mythic RG Minigun</a>. This weapon could actually shoot bullets and drop Eminem's music and lyrics in tune to the gun's rate of fire. Eminem was also featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-remix-finale-features-snoop-dogg-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-tribute/1100-6527943/" data-ref-id="1100-6527943">the star-studded concert event that closed out Fortnite Remix Chapter 2</a> alongside Snoop Dogg, Ice Spice, and a tribute to the late rapper Juice WRLD.</p><p>Although Eminem hasn't made many video game appearances, his music has been used to promote titles before, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-15s-launch-trailer-brings-on-eminem/1100-6445808/" data-ref-id="1100-6445808">the launch trailer for Final Fantasy 15</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k19-soundtrack-features-eminem-metallica-post/1100-6461867/" data-ref-id="1100-6461867">the soundtrack for WWE 2K19</a>. In 2022, Kirk Ewing shared a story about a Hollywood producer approaching Rockstar Games about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eminem-could-have-starred-in-a-gta-movie-from-top-gun-director/1100-6509155/" data-ref-id="1100-6509155">a Grand Theft Auto movie starring Eminem</a> and directed by Top Gun helmer Tony Scott. According to Ewing, Rockstar's Sam Houser turned down the pitch.</p><p>As for Fortnite, some of the game's next collaborations include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-be-getting-jason-voorhees-and-ghostface-for-halloween/1100-6533777/" data-ref-id="1100-6533777">potentially Friday the 13's Jason Voorhees and Scream's Ghostface</a>.</p>

                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has revealed the two deceased Hollywood legends that he would have enjoyed working with for one of his games. Speaking to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire</a>, Kojima singled out Steve McQueen (Bullitt, The Great Escape) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks).</p><p>Kojima said McQueen was his "childhood hero," and he's not giving up on the possibility of him showing up in a future project, even though the actor died 45 years ago. "If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday," he said.</p><p>Kojima went on to say that he had "always hoped" to cast Lynch in a video game of his. The visionary filmmaker and actor passed away earlier. Kojima was a big fan of his, saying he was "devastated" like so many others when Lynch died in January this year.</p><p>While Kojima didn't get to work with McQueen or Lynch, he has worked with numerous Hollywood directors on his projects over the years. The filmmakers Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Edgar Wright, Guillemo del Toro, and Nicolas Winding Refn all appeared in Death Stranding, for example. Looking ahead, Kojima is teaming up with Oscar-winning Jordan Peele for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-teases-new-game-od-people-will-love-it-or-hate-it/1100-6533580/" data-ref-id="1100-6533580">OD</a>, though the exact nature of the partnership is unknown.</p><p>Kojima's latest game was Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which was released in June on PS5. In addition to OD, Kojima is working on an espionage game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint</a> with Sony--he revealed in the IndieWire interview that the game is still early in development and is in the conceptual phase where he is the only person working on it.</p>

                <p>After a bit of a hiatus, Hot Shots Golf is making a triumphant return with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Everybody%27s+Golf+Hot+Shots+PC+Preorders+And+Unlock+Pac-Man+Early&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A32&amp;fnarticle_id=6533729&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots-pc-preorder-fanatical-deal%2F1100-6533729%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>. Releasing on September 5 for PS5, Switch, and PC, it's looking like a fresh take on the classic golf video game series, featuring simple controls, a variety of solo and multiplayer gameplay modes, and a long list of character customization options. While preorders are available on all platforms, PC players should consider <strong>preordering at Fanatical, where it's on sale for $33.59 (was $40)</strong>. This is the best price we've seen for the upcoming game, and the discount is only available before launch. Preordering the game unlocks the playable Pac-Man character early. You'll also get an additional 5% off voucher for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorders are also eligible for Fanatical's Summer Bonus Drop deal, which gets you a random bonus prize when you spend $15 or more during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanatical-summer-sale-2025/1100-6533680/" data-ref-id="1100-6533680">Fanatical's Summer Sale event</a>. The possible prizes include free game keys and bonus coupon codes. Grabbing the game at Fanatical gets you an official key redeemable via Steam.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is the first new game in the popular Hot Shots Golf series (known as Everybody's Gold in Japan) since 2017. It's also notable as the first game in the series to launch on PC and Nintendo platforms--all previous games in the series have been exclusive to PlayStation consoles and handhelds, and many were never localized outside of Japan. While the series features many of the core mechanics of other golf sim games--including swing strength meter, varied courses, and even weather conditions to contend with--Everybody's Golf offers a more arcadey take on the genre, with simple controls, cartoony visual style, and multiple gameplay modes, including challenge modes and high-score leaderboards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933"></a><figcaption>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg"></figure><p>As mentioned above, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots digital preorders are also available on PS5 and Switch. While the game isn't discounted on those platforms, you can still get the early Pac-Man unlock preorder bonus by securing your copy early. Pac-Man will be available as a character in the full game after launch, too, but preorders unlock him early. Note you'll have to complete the "My First Golf" in-game activity first before you can redeem the early unlock.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is just one of many upcoming PC games that are discounted at Fanatical, so it's worth<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Everybody%27s+Golf+Hot+Shots+PC+Preorders+And+Unlock+Pac-Man+Early&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A32&amp;fnarticle_id=6533729&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fupcoming-games&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots-pc-preorder-fanatical-deal%2F1100-6533729%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> checking out the retailer's listings</a> if you've got PC games on your wishlist.

Additionally, the animations for when characters attach to a zipline are bugged. Beyond that, the aim assist feature when players are close to smoke is a work in progress, the studio said. Another known issue is that players can sink into the ground after reviving a teammate.</p><p>Battlefield Studios added that it's aware of weapon-balancing issues specific to recoil. The studio said it knew about these issues for some time but wasn't able to address them for the open beta. There are UI/UX known issues, too, including the "Close Map" button not working properly and the pick-up prompt no appearing on some gadgets.</p><p>You can see a bigger list of known issues below, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953500544162500657" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Battlefield Studios</a>.
