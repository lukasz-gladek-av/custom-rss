                <p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher Netease have revealed more details about the upcoming free-to-play gacha game Anata, which was formerly known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-mugen/" data-ref-id="5000-600379">Project Mugen</a>. In a brand-new teaser--that looks like an homage to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">first GTA 6 trailer</a>--the company showed off some of the gameplay for Ananta, where players will patrol the streets of Nova City as an agent of the Anti-Chaos Directorate.</p><p>Similar to other gacha games like Zenless Zone Zero, Ananta has an anime-inspired design, and Naked Science says that players will get to explore an "open-world urban RPG" where they take on the forces of Chaos.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n26InrperQE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n26InrperQE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Nova City has plunged into Chaos, from spooky paranormal phenomena to toilets racing through traffic in the streets, the game promises to offer a unique blend of humor, adventure, and mystery," the official description for Ananta reads.</p><p>As seen in the trailer above, it looks like there'll be some bizarre enemies to face off against, like sentient toilet armies, cars armed with chainsaw arms, and other forms of weirdness plaguing Nova City. You'll be able to get around the metropolis in a variety of vehicles, and judging by the trailer, it looks like the characters can also swing into action or sneak around enemies in a manner that looks heavily inspired by Insomniac's recent Spider-Man games.</p><p>When it comes to combat, Naked Science added that you can use your surroundings to defeat enemies, and between patrols, you'll also be able to take a break with various activities ranging from pub crawls to pumping some iron in a local gym. Ananta is in development for PC, PS5, and iOS, but it doesn't have a release date yet.</p>
