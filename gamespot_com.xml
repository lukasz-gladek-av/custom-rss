                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is the GTA6 of the indie games world. It's the megaton game that every other game wants to dodge. But sometimes publishers just can't change their release dates. We put together a list of some of the other games releasing today to check out if Silksong isn't your jam (or you just like being contrarian), as well as a few of the anticipated games that scooted out of the way of Hornet and her deadly needle.</p><h2>Games Releasing September 4, 2025</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/adventure-of-samsara/" data-ref-id="5000-513724"><strong>Adventure of Samsara</strong></a> - Notably, Adventure of Samsara is a search-action (colloquially known as a Metroidvania) game, just like Hollow Knight, and you're also a little guy with a sword. This game features some great-looking pixel art.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "The Order of the Giants" DLC</strong> - This expansion delves deeper into the "Order of Giants" hinted at in the base game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538"><strong>Hell is Us</strong></a> - In a place ravaged by war and a mysterious calamity, you search for answers about your own past. This game is a third-person action game with souls-like elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486"><strong>NBA 2K26</strong></a> - If there's anyone that isn't worried about Silksong affecting their sales, its probably 2K Games and their latest NBA game. There just isn't as much overlap with basketball as there is with a game like The Adventures of Samsara or a souls-inspired game like Hell is Us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jetrunner/" data-ref-id="5000-625135"><strong>Jetrunner</strong></a> - A stylish first-person parkour game with flashy, cel-shaded visuals.</p><p>Other games releasing today include the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everybodys-golf-hot-shots/" data-ref-id="5000-670014">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, and the Apple Arcade exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nfl-retro-bowl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-690212">NFL Retro Bowl '26</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, a bunch of other games made a run for it once Silksong claimed that September 4 date. The sci-fi roguelite FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/moros-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-563235">Moros Protocol</a> jumped to September 18, as did the PlayStation 1-aesthetic roguelike survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/megabonk/" data-ref-id="5000-656106">Megabonk</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/" data-ref-id="5000-590662">Baby Steps</a>, the follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/getting-over-it-with-bennett-foddy/" data-ref-id="5000-473119">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a>, awkwardly planted one foot in front of the other toward a September 23 release date. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/" data-ref-id="5000-566115">Demonschool</a> was set to release September 23, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ysbryd.net/post/3lxajaaptg22t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer Ysbird said of the delay</a>, "We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red."</p><p>Meanwhile, Hollow Knight: Silksong has landed with extremely positive word of mouth. It also almost immediately started <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashing the servers</a> for Steam and the Nintendo eShop, and affecting service on Game Pass. Hollow Knight: Silksong peaked on Steam with 535,000 players, putting it in the top three for concurrent players alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike-2/" data-ref-id="5000-595646">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dota-2/" data-ref-id="5000-87436">Dota 2</a>.</p>

                <p>Last month, the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titan-quest-2-early-access-will-begin-this-summer/1100-6531406/">Titan Quest 2 arrived in early access on PC</a>, and according to THQ Nordic, it sold 300,000 copies in just its first three days. While reacting to that news, former THQ vice president of studio operations Richard Browne shared a few of the reasons why Titan Quest 2 wasn't released almost two decades ago.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7358661819734921216/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%2C7358864581047341056%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287358864581047341056%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%29" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/09/03/former-thq-vice-president-the-development-of-titan-quest-2-was-first-approved-19-years-ago-but-it-was-halted-due-to-marketing-issues-and-the-lead-game-designer-not-being-pr-friendly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game World Observer</a>), Browne noted that THQ had given the greenlight for the sequel in 2006. However, the development team at Iron Lore Entertainment couldn't get past THQ's marketing department, which rejected the proof-of-concept demo.</p><p>"[Titan Quest] was one of those games that just sold and sold; but our marketing department didn't see it," wrote Browne. "We had a great 360 demo with the camera lower and controlled--they nixed it using 'Emsense' to show that the demo (three months work) didn't resonate."</p><p>Emsense utilized sensors that monitored players' heart rate, breath rate, and other factors to measure their response to a given product. Because Titan Quest 2 didn't get a favorable response through Emsense, that was one of the justifications for shelving the project.</p><p>Browne also mentioned that the marketing team wasn't eager to work with the game's lead designer, Brian Sullivan, whom they considered as "not being PR friendly."</p><p>"Brian was great," recalled Browne. "He [was just] a khaki shorts, black socks, and loafers kinda [guy] and that made their job hard."</p><p>Titan Quest 2 eventually ended up in development under Grimlore Games for THQ Nordic. The sequel is currently only available on PC during its early access period. But the game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>
