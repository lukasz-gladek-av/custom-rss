                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise. Given the move to Unreal is still early, a new game in the series was said to not be "imminent."</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors continue to circulate that older Halo games once exclusive to Xbox, as well as a rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">may release on PlayStation 5</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-is-optimistic-about-xbox-multiplatform-strategy/1100-6529186/" data-ref-id="1100-6529186">Microsoft's new multi-platform game release strategy</a>. However, no official announcements have been made.</p>

                <p>A co-founder of the Call of Duty studio Treyarch recently pleaded guilty to striking a firefighting plane with a drone during the recent LA fires. Under the plea deal, Peter T. Akemann will avoid the potential penalty of a year in prison and will instead perform 150 hours of community service, particularly in the area of Southern California's wildfire relief efforts. The deal also includes a $65,000 fine, the cost of repairing the firefighting plane in question.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>, Akemann flew a drone over the area of the Palisades Fire while a "Super Scooper" water-dumping plane was conducting operations in the area. His drone struck the plane's wing, causing enough damage that it had to be grounded for a period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">US attorney Joseph McNally, one of the prosecutors on the case, released a statement noting that "flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations." He reiterated that those who do fly drones in those conditions will be arrested and prosecuted just like Akemann.</p><p dir="ltr">Akemann's camp released a statement stating that the co-founder is "deeply sorry" and "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment." After co-founding Treyarch, Akemann parted way with the company more than 20 years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604527/drone-crashed-into-la-wildfire-plane-plea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge reports</a> that he recently departed his role as the president of Skydance Interactive and that his social media accounts have been scrubbed, including X and LinkedIn.  </p><p dir="ltr">Several major video game publishers have marshaled resources to help fight the LA fires, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-starts-in-game-event-to-raise-funds-for-la-fire-victims/1100-6528884/" data-ref-id="1100-6528884">Riot Games</a>, which implemented in-game fundraisers in League of Legends and Valorant.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking his mind and sharing his opinions lately following his exit from Sony, and now he's discussed his thoughts on the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZW7DhH1Gh0st-zxp&amp;v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-on-switch-2-reveal-i-was-surprised-there-werent-many-surprises/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Yoshida said the Switch 2 reveal event was underwhelming and that the only major surprise was the event's lack of surprises.</p><p>"I was surprised there were not many surprises," Yoshida said. "The only surprise to me was the mice thing that they showed."</p><p>Yoshida is referring to the sequence in the Switch 2 announcement trailer that showed the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons sliding across a surface like a computer mouse would. Yoshida said he hopes Nintendo uses the mouse controls for "some more weird, amazing way" that people won't see coming, as opposed to the control setup being used to play a game like Call of Duty on Switch 2.</p><p>Yoshida said he hopes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo's big Nintendo Direct in April</a> will "reveal something that's still hidden to us about Switch 2." He also addressed the string of leaks that preceded Nintendo's official Switch 2 announcement, saying he felt "very sorry" for Nintendo for the "disappointing" situation. A leak can ruin a good surprise, and Yoshida said he hopes for no further Switch 2 leaks.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that Yoshida said he was a "huge Nintendo fan," but ultimately wished the Switch 2 announcement "could have been a larger reveal."</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> Yoshida left Sony on January 15, 2025 after more than 30 years with the company.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-set-to-air-later-this-month-report/1100-6529189/" data-ref-id="1100-6529189">next State of Play event could happen very soon.</a></p>

                <p>Grand Theft Auto V actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in the incredibly popular game, has spoken out about his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Damage</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1886459125304799531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's confident the game will be "fantastic," going on to say no one ever knows what to expect from Rockstar Games, and that's part of the reason why he's so eager to see what the studio is cooking up.</p><p>"You never know what Rockstar is going to do," he said. "What I tell people is, be patient. It's going to be worth the wait. From what I've seen, it's going to be amazing. They're going to blow our [GTA V] numbers away."</p><p>By "numbers," Luke was referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtav-generates-800-million-in-24-hours/1100-6414611/" data-ref-id="1100-6414611">$800 million that GTA V earned in its first 24 hours back in 2013.</a> Luke said he expects GTA VI to make $1.3 billion in its first day.</p><p>Before this, DFC Intelligence said it was expecting GTA VI to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copes and earn $3.2 billion in its first year</a>, including $1 billion from preorder revenue alone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vUKXTE2S5mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Luke pointed out how his character, Michael, has never been brought back to GTA Online. GTA V's other two main characters, Trevor (Steven Ogg) and Franklin (Shawn Fonteno), did come to GTA Online. A piece of GTA Online DLC revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">Michael is still alive after the events of GTA V</a>, and this has led many to believe Rockstar might eventually release new GTA Online DLC that focuses on or at least includes Michael.</p><p>If Luke knows the answer, he's not revealing any secrets.</p><p>"If you look at GTA Online, for example, Michael hasn't been back on GTA Online. Maybe he's coming in a final DLC? Maybe he's not. Maybe [Michael, Franklin, and Trevor will be] in GTA 6, like [its online mode]. Maybe. Maybe not. You know Rockstar is not going to tell you anything. And if we say anything, you know they will not be very happy," Luke said.</p><p>Ogg, who played Trevor in GTA V, said previously that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">he wants his character to show up in GTA VI and then immediately get killed.</a></p><p>In other news, there is said to be "hope" by some in the video game industry that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA VI will cost as much as $100</a>, with other publishers raising prices as well to help the video game industry rebound. While some might want that, not everyone does, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">one prominent researcher believes the game will be $70.</a></p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">Rockstar has not said a word about the game</a>, while management at parent company Take-Two has only discussed the game at a very high level. That's expected to happen again this week, when Take-Two reports earnings on February 6.</p><p>GTA VI is set for release in Fall 2025, but some believe the game will be delayed to 2026. After all, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar Games release in the past 10 years has been delayed</a>, so it would be a break from tradition if the game is <em>not </em>delayed.</p>
