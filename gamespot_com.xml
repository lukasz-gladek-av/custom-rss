                <p>So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-2/" data-ref-id="5000-137">Fallout 2</a> and a writer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>--believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received.</p><p>When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, "They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009456971339149774%7Ctwgr%5E99f1ee048f913fdce98a2199dfe0f1e4cd7a6c94%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fzenimax-bethesda%2Flead-fallout-new-vegas-dev-says-bethesda-strayed-away-from-the-rpgs-origins" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout - and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me.</p>  — Chris Avellone (@ChrisAvellone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Avellone went on to explain that he doesn't hate Bethesda, and he praised the publisher's open-world games before calling out its weaknesses regarding its linear stories and "their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill. But every developer has their pros and cons."</p><p>Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-says-todd-howard/1100-6537213/" data-ref-id="1100-6537213">praised Obsidian Entertainment's work on Fallout: New Vegas</a>, and said that the studio was the only choice to handle the game. Avellone and other Obsidian employees had worked on the previous Fallout games, and that made it the ideal choice to develop New Vegas.</p><p>Later this year, PC gamers will be able to buy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6536671/" data-ref-id="1100-6536671">a Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary physical bundle</a>, but console players will be left out of that. Several players--including actor Danny Trejo--have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">openly called for a Fallout: New Vegas remake</a>. They may get their wish, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">remakes of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas</a> are rumored to be in development.</p>

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">described as</a> an "experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." Now, reporter Jez Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2010993531037302935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the game was "only ever a concept" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.</p><p>He added: "It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else."</p><p>In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror." The description continued: "Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible."</p><p>Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as "experimental" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a "showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium."</p><p>As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corden reported</a> that the developer's next title, which he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KPhoHILH4Wo?t=2176s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on the Xbox Two podcast</a> could be Hellblade 3, "will be more combat-involved and interactive" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.</p><p>Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.</a></p><p>2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations. The ball gets rolling on January 22, which is when Microsoft will host the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">Xbox Developer Direct, focusing primarily on Fable and Forza Horizon 6. </a></p>

                <p>We're a couple of weeks into 2026, but Nintendo is already looking back at last year, releasing its annual year-in-review wrap-up for 2025. While Nintendo (and most companies and services) traditionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-year-in-review-for-2024-is-available-now-get-a-free-2025-calendar/1100-6528550/" data-ref-id="1100-6528550">releases these summaries in December</a> of each year, it pushed back its Switch wrap-up to January for reasons unstated.</p><p>While it missed the usual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">wave of yearly wrap-ups</a>, the plus side is that Nintendo's 2025 summary includes your December play time, so your many hours of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond just might eke out on your list of most-played games.</p><p>The personalized wrap-up sums up how many games you played on Switch and Switch 2 and how many hours you played, showing a month-by-month breakdown and evaluating your favorite game genres. Additionally, you can choose a favorite game you played this year and share a graphic that summarizes the data, and you can download a free 2026 calendar at the end to print out.</p><p>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, Nintendo's website also pulls Switch data going back to the console's launch in 2017. If you're patient enough to scroll all the way to the bottom, you can download a video that displays this data.</p><p>2025 was an important year for Nintendo, with the Switch 2 launching in June to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">massive sales success</a>. Nintendo-published highlights in the Switch 2's first months on the market included Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Indie hits like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, along with third-party games previously released on other platforms like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, also graced the Switch 2's early software lineup.</p><p>In the coming year, Switch 2 owners may return to the timesink known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-is-nintendos-cheapest-paid-upgrade-yet/1100-6537334/" data-ref-id="1100-6537334">Animal Crossing: New Horizons with a cheap upgrade</a>. Other upcoming Nintendo titles include Mario Tennis Fever, The Duskbloods, and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, with third-party offerings including Resident Evil Requiem and 007 First Light.</p>
