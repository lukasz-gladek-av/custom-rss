                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we look back at the western in the context of its cinematic inspirations.</em></p><p>Stories about the American West, just like stories about knights or ninjas or other iconic figures, are not a monolith. There are stories fantastical and grounded, silly and serious, traditional and rebellious. Red Dead Redemption is a spaghetti Western in the same lineage as so many of Sergio Leone's movies, like A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Even among other open-world games and the other games in its own series, Red Dead Redemption is a singular experience. It delivers on the fantasy of playing a legendary gunslinger in a grimy American West. And there will never be another game quite like it.</p><h3 dir="ltr">A Look Back at the Red Dead Trilogy</h3><p dir="ltr">The Red Dead games are a trilogy, though we rarely think of the first entry, Red Dead Revolver. All three games in the series are wildly different takes on the Western; even though the most recent two have consistent characters and a chronology to them, they could hardly be more different in presentation, tone, and style.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Revolver, developed by Rockstar San Diego (originally Angel Studios) and funded in part by Capcom, is a linear action game with a simple revenge narrative. Stylistically, it has more in common with a comic book or anime than any Western film or the rest of the games in the Red Dead series. There are limbs flying everywhere, and it sports over-the-top bosses like a huge guy with dynamite strapped to his head and steel plates on his arms as shields.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead Redemption 2, on the other hand, is a Western epic with more in common with True Grit or Open Range than with something like Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. It works overtime to represent its characters and setting as accurately as possible (with notable exceptions like the treatment of the people of Appalachia). It's so interested in authenticity that historian and professor Tore Olsson wrote an entire book on where RDR2 succeeds and comes up short with regard to representing reality and came away with the conclusion that, despite some mistakes and some places where more depth would be warranted, the game got more right than not.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496370"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496370-ss_b23f5fe259eed0aead274b670e357d087fa3b1f4.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">That brings us to the middle child, 2010's Red Dead Redemption, a game that takes inspiration from the Spaghetti Western movies. The term Spaghetti Western refers to a genre of film made primarily between 1960 and 1978, and produced in Europe--most commonly Italy and Spain.</p><p dir="ltr">Prior Westerns were often about mythologizing the American West. Cowboys were clear heroes or villains, and the lines between good and evil were clear and easily delineated. Spaghetti Westerns blurred those lines, making the villains charming and the heroes surly and difficult to be around.</p><p dir="ltr">They also went hard on style. The opening sequence of A Fistful of Dollars is iconic, with silhouettes of gunslingers battling it out, backed by whistling and chanting music unlike anything the cinematic Old West had ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">We see all that at work in Red Dead Redemption. The graphics and music often take direct influence from Sergio Leone's movies. The music especially stands out here. Composed by musicians Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, Red Dead Redemption uses some traditional instruments like the jaw harp, but it also broadens out from that with the score combining, for example, the sound of a smooth harmonica with grimy, heavily distorted electric guitar.</p><p dir="ltr">The story, too, feels entirely of a piece with Spaghetti Western sensibilities, for better and worse. There are some parts that haven't aged well. The character known as Irish stands out here as a poorly written character built on gross stereotypes of Irish people that sours your replay of an entire section of the game. Even that feels like something straight out of a Spaghetti Western, though, where characters were broad and often built on simple themes or stereotypes.</p><p dir="ltr">Other, more elemental parts match up though, too. John Marston is a Good Guy, but he isn't a <em>good guy</em>. He's not rising to a challenge, but being blackmailed into an impossible situation. He's abrasive, too. Even those of us who love the game can agree that Marston's voice takes a bit of time to warm up to. On the opposite side is the immediately charming Dutch van der Linde: a guy with big ideas and a smooth, deep voice. Side characters like the snake-oil salesman Nigel West Dickens are broad, goofy, and unreliable, while characters like Bonnie MacFarlane tempt John toward an "honest" life that would come with heavy compromises, which he can't afford to even really dream about. Landon Ricketts, the aging American gunslinger that John meets in Mexico, represents the characters played by actors like Lee van Cleef in movies such as For a Few Dollars More--wise killers who have earned that wisdom with blood and loss.His battles against his former comrades are only triumphant in that you survive them. They're not victories over evil. John doesn't want to be there, but the axe over his wife and son's heads has forced his hand, and he has to do that dirty work. His old friends have gone sour, providing some justification for his actions, but they're not evil.</p><p dir="ltr">Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid isn't a Spaghetti Western per se, being an American production, but it lands smack dab in the middle of the Spaghetti Western era, and shares enough of that broad, comedic tone and grimy quality to work here. John Marston's final moments are a take on the movie's iconic ending, in which the characters end on a freeze frame over the sound of a hail of gunfire. John opens the barn to see more lawmen than he could ever take down, all aiming at him. He gets his final moment and empties his revolver into the crowd, but he was never going to get to live a peaceful life. As much as he might try, it was not much more than a dalliance for a life-long gunslinger.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Dead 2 feels like a slog when I try to imagine re-playing it--all these mean people making mistakes and killing each other, and a beautiful landscape full of terrible people. It's undoubtedly a beautiful and incredibly written and realized game. But sometimes you want A Fistful of Dollars more than 3:10 to Yuma. Red Dead Redemption is the answer. Despite being full of cruelty, it is an adventure about a reluctant hero with the skills and grit to get himself out of so many bad situations, given all the grandiosity and flamboyance of those movies that inspired it.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read why its story <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-is-at-its-best-when-it-shuts-up/1100-6531573/" data-ref-id="1100-6531573">works best when it shuts up</a>.</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Red Dead Redemption is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, May 18, 2025. Below, we consider that it may be better at showing than telling.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As a rule, Westerns are sincere. Sure, there are outright farces like Blazing Saddles. Plenty of classic Westerns like Rio Bravo have a warm, comedic side. Even dark epics like the Searchers have moments of levity. But even when they are funny, Westerns play their archetypes straight. They are easy to make fun of because they are so unfeigned. In this context, Red Dead Redemption struggles to find its place. It imports Grand Theft Auto's satire into a bare and somber world. In many moments, protagonist John Marston is the only voice of reason among cliches and caricatures. When Red Dead Redemption talks, it is often cheap and unserious. When it shuts up, it manages a real poetry, thanks to its austere landscapes and unpretentious world.</p><p dir="ltr">First, let's dig into its writing. RDR is a sunset Western, set in the waning days of Western expansion. Marston is a man out of time: a cowboy criminal in a world that wants to kill him (and will). Marston is foolish. He hunts down his former compatriots on the behest of the US government, because he hopes they will keep his promise to return his family to him and leave him alone. He is wrong. The killings he undertakes swing back on him and his family alike.</p><p dir="ltr">This tragic arc is compelling, but a relatively narrow portion of the game is spent on it. Far more time is spent on Marston cavorting with scoundrels to track his targets. These characters are mostly cliches. Nigel West Dickens is a sniveling snake-oil salesman. Irish is, well, a drunk Irishman. Agustin Allende is a cruel dictator, and Landon Ricketts a noble marshall. Like Rockstar's other other open-world games, RDR's story missions are largely siloed off from the rest of the game. Many of them are just ride-alongs: long discussions on horseback, after which there might be a shootout. A huge portion of RDR's runtime is listening to inane characters prattle on as Marston scolds, tut-tuts, or shrugs his shoulders.</p><p dir="ltr">In this regard, the game's treatment of Mexico is particularly egregious. The Mexican Revolution was one of the most complex conflicts of this time period, with dozens of factions. RDR reduces this to two sides: an oppressive government and a revolutionary army led by the charlatan Abraham Reyes, who only wants power for himself. Marston aids both sides to progress his own goals, thereby holding himself above the conflict altogether. He frowns as he helps the dictator destroy a village and shakes his head as the revolutionaries celebrate their victory. The game's pessimism is not bleak, but cheap.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496369"></a><figcaption>Red Dead Redemption</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4496369-ss_8d45239f5f6ed57bcf7a3b6bf7f5b23fa7d76a57.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In part, the RDR’s political commentary feels incomplete because of Marsten himself. He is both an emblem of the United States’ worst sins, a hired gun meant to kill political dissidents and petty criminals alike, and a victim, a detainee forced to do labor the government won’t dirty its own hands with. This is a meaningful tension that RDR does not flesh out. If anything, Marsten’s plight is directly compared to the native peoples of the game. Both have been displaced from their homes. But Marsten is exactly the kind of white frontiersman who drove so many native peoples from their homelands. Because of the game’s satirical tone and Marsten’s wise-guy, above-it-all posture, it cannot mine that tension for drama.</p><p dir="ltr">The game even undercuts its most effective moments. When Marston crosses the border to Mexico, an original song by José González plays. I still remember reaching this moment for the first time. Dawn scattered light across the virtual desert. Blood-red dirt and sky shone in an unbroken line. But this moment is preceded by Irish's drunken hijinks. The grandeur of RDR's world makes the needle drop land, but it is a moment that the game does not build to or descend from.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the hardline separation between the delivery of RDR's narrative and its wide-open world is an asset as much as a weakness. This is no Ubisoft checklist world. RDR's side activities, particularly its minigames like poker and liar's dice, exist on their own terms. You can't capture outposts to spread your influence or win a tournament to become the most renowned poker player in the West. Instead, there's a seat at the table for you, if you want to play a hand or two, but the dealer will deal with or without you. RDR's random events can feel aggrandizing. Marston always arrives just in time to stop a highway robbery or rescue a fair maiden from vagabonds. But Marston can get swindled too. Highwaymen will try to take his horse or bandits will hide behind rocks to try and ambush him. These systems work in tandem to make the world feel separate from the player. The sun sets and rises. The same folks get drunk at the local bar every night. Marston wanders between them.</p><p dir="ltr">RDR's simulacra of the natural world helps that sense of separateness, of things acting and moving without your input. The game features extensive hunting and foraging mechanics. Even if you don't engage with them, creatures scatter in the bushes by the roadside, herds of buffalo and cattle graze in grassy fields, and a chance encounter with a bear can ruin your day. This does result in some silly video game hijinks--the game’s predators will attack you for no reason--but there is also a wildness that can settle into its quiet moments.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of that wildness is that the game is still gorgeous. Each one of its biomes has a distinct character. It has its share of spectacular vistas, pulling on real-world locations like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/red-dead-redemption/2018/10/23/17986758/red-dead-redemption-best-western-game" rel="nofollow ">Monument Valley</a>, but it is also willing to trade in mundanities: a well-worn dirt road, a chicken coop after dusk, playing horseshoes in the backyard. Rockstar's obsession with granular, background simulation <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption-2/red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" rel="nofollow ">can be absurd</a>, but it is also obviously a part of how its games feel unique. RDR is also quiet. There are no chattering radios or blaring car horns. There is only the desert. RDR can feel meditative, even boring, in a way few video games do.</p><p dir="ltr">The ending is where the best parts of RDR's talkative side and its quiet side align. After completing his task, Marston returns to his farm and his family. His wife Abigail and his son Jack are not cliches. Both have complex feelings for the man who has been so absent from their lives. The game takes its time unraveling these threads. In the meantime, Marston works like an ordinary man. He does chores. For the game's last few hours, there is a feeling of merely being in the world.</p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate, violent interruption of Marston's quiet life is all more heartbreaking for how long it takes to come. The force of Red Dead Redemption's final images help explain its outsized reputation. Marston promising his family he'll find them when he knows he'll die. A deep breath before facing the agents sent to kill him. Blood pouring from his mouth as he tries to stand. There is plenty of wanton violence in RDR, but this is a moment that feels actually senseless. It's all because of how quiet it is, how much build-up leads to here. It is emblematic of RDR's politics that a white settler is the ultimate, symbolic martyr of US state violence. That in no way takes away from the specter of death RDR summons at its conclusion.</p><p dir="ltr">But here's the thing: One of RDR's primary inspirations is Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian. At once beautiful, bleak, and absurd, the novel follows a band of men as they murder for money along the line between Mexico and the US, loosely based on the real-life Glanton gang. Blood Meridian is ash and gunpowder printed to page. So much of RDR's power is derived from it, the game can't help but feel derivative. Furthermore, it reaches emotional depths RDR can't offer in a fraction of the time. But what those can't offer is RDR's aesthetic embodiment. The spontaneous sunrise of a clear desert night, a coyote howl, a distant campfire, as you ride into the darkness.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>For more on Red Dead Redemption's 15th anniversary, read about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-there-will-never-be-another-spaghetti-western-like-it/1100-6531443/" data-ref-id="1100-6531443">spaghetti western cinematic inspirations</a>.</em></p>
