                <p>It's official: Valve's SteamOS will be available on more platforms soon, and the first handheld PC gaming device to adopt the operating system will be the new Lenovo Legion Go S. At CES 2025, it was revealed that the slim Lenovo unit will run on the Linux-based OS--, the same one used on Valve's Steam Deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4424121"></a><figcaption>Lenovo Legion Go S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4424121-lenovo-legion-go.jpg"></figure><p>The big draw here is that SteamOS is more intuitive to use and better suited for smaller screens when compared to its Windows 11 counterparts. While you are losing out on the flexibility of being able to load games from multiple storefronts, SteamOS makes up for it by being quick and easy to use thanks to its design. Essentially, if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play handheld gaming PC that isn't a chore to use and you don't mind sticking to Steam, these new Lenovo devices could be perfect for you.</p><p>As for the new Lenovo model, the Legion Go S looks like it'll be a direct competitor to the Steam Deck thanks to several hardware changes. Most notable is that it won't offer Switch-like removable controllers, but it will keep the small trackpad found underneath the face buttons. These handhelds will be flexing some impressive power thanks to the new AMD Z2 Go chip. These will also be equipped with a 120Hz variable-refresh-rate display and customizable levers on the rear.</p><p>Lenovo will launch a $730 model equipped with a Windows OS, a 1TB SSD, and 32GB of RAM first, and another Windows OS version with 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD for $600 in May. The SteamOS Legion Go S is also planned to launch in May, and while exact hardware specs haven't been confirmed yet, we do know that it'll be priced at $500. Additionally, Valve will support it with SteamOS updates.</p>
