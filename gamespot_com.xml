                <p>When it comes to treasure, smooth gunplay, and chatterbox robots, Borderlands is in a class of its own. A new mainline entry in the looter-shooter series is set to arrive soon, and this new chapter in the ongoing saga of Vault Hunters and alien booty looks set to introduce some interesting changes to the formula of this long-running series. Ahead of its release in September, we've gathered up everything we know about Borderlands 4 so far, and what you can expect from the game when it's unleashed on PC and console.</p><h2 id="When_will_Borderlands_4_be_released_">When will Borderlands 4 be released?</h2><p>Borderlands 4 will be released on September 23, and is one of several big games that Take-Two has lined up for the year.

We've seen glimpses of him in the trailers for Borderlands 4, and from what little information has been revealed, we do know that he's a sharp-dressed dictator aiming to create a perfect world order. That, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/">and he's apparently far more dangerous than Handsome Jack ever was</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630"></a><figcaption>One of the new locales you'll explore in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg"></figure><p>While Borderlands 3 expanded beyond Pandora to several other worlds, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/">Borderlands 4 will take place on the planet of Kairos</a>. Because the game has been designed for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, this makes Kairos a seamless and "expansive" location to explore. According to Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford, if you see an area of the world that interests you, you'll be free to explore it.</p><p>"One of the challenges with the term 'open world' is other games have done different things with that and there's things that we're doing that none of them have done," Pitchford said. "But there are things that we, specifically, don't do because we are Borderlands. And we care so deeply about combat dynamics and care so deeply about that moment-to-moment feeling. We craft this [world]. Everything that unfolds has [purpose]. You can feel the heart of the designer behind it. You can tell, people that care a lot made this shit."</p><p>"They're putting this here for [the player]. This isn't all just a systemic, algorithmically filled world. So be careful when you're talking about this. I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done."</p><p>As for the world itself, Gearbox describes it as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/">high-tech but lo-fi location</a> full of interesting opportunities for players to experiment with gameplay and weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629"></a><figcaption>Meet the new Vault Hunters of Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now let's talk about what we know about the game's playable characters so far.</p><p>Vault Hunters are the bread and butter of Borderlands games, as each unique character allows you to experience the main campaign from a different angle. There'll be four Vault Hunters to choose from on launch day--a tradition that dates back to the first Borderlands game--and each one will offer a specific archetype role. Gearbox hasn't elaborated on the Vault Hunter classes yet, but judging from the early gameplay trailers, it looks like we'll get to play as a hulking gunslinger, powerful Siren, and melee-focused swordsman in Borderlands 4.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_development_news">Borderlands 4 development news</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631"></a><figcaption>This new Vault Hunter is an absolute unit</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Like the previous games, Borderlands is a looter-shooter that mixes an exotic selection of weapons with unique action skills. The previous game shook up its bread-and-butter gunplay by making each weapon family--Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Atlas, Vladof, Tediore, and Torgue--feel even more distinct from each other, so it'll be interesting to see if this idea carries through to Borderlands 4.</p><p>Gearbox has added that it wants to find a balance between approachability and complexity with the gameplay, both with the core first-person-shooting action and the RPG skill-trees that could be customized to create powerful Vault Hunter builds. At the same time, you can expect billions of different weapons to collect on your journey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">Gearbox wants to cut back on</a> the "overabundance of toilet humor" that Borderlands 3 heavily relied on.</p><p>It also wouldn't be a Borderlands game without an option to catch a ride! So far, we've seen a chunky hoverbike and a high-tech chariot straight out of the pod-racing scene from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, and it'll be interesting to see what else we can get behind the wheel of in the full game.</p><p>While you'll be able to get around Kairos with one of several new vehicles, a big upgrade to the gameplay is a grappling hook that can be used to reach areas and help you out in combat.</p><p>The other big question we're still waiting to see answered relates to what we can expect <em>after </em>Borderlands 4 launches.</p><p>In a tradition dating back to the very first Borderlands game, Gearbox has regularly supported its looter-shooters with post-launch DLC expansions. The developer has yet to confirm if this will be the case for Borderlands 4, but we wouldn't be too surprised to see history repeat itself here.</p><p>Some of the best Borderlands stories have come from these expansions after all--like Assault on Dragonkeep, The Claptastic Voyage, and Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot--so here's hoping we get a few more post-launch episodes.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4 State of Play event</a> is set for this spring, so it might not be much longer until Gearbox shows off and discusses the game even more.</p>

Plus, Discord is getting in on the loot box action as well, offering five of them as a reward for a new quest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For the Discord quest, all players will need to do is accept the quest via the app and then play Overwatch 2 for 15 minutes. After completing and claiming the quest, players can redeem the code via Battle.net to receive their five free loot boxes. Quests can be found and accepted in the Discord app via the Discover tab. Players will have until February 25 to accept and complete the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Overwatch 2 weekly event challenges, players will need to first complete five matches (with wins counting as two) and then 15 matches to earn another five loot boxes per challenge. Since wins count as two, these can be done in just a few matches if your team comes out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the Discord quest, and that's a total of 15 loot boxes for very little overall playtime. Players will have until February 25 to complete the in-game challenges, which also feature other rewards like the Rainy Day skin for Mercy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">Loot boxes work a little differently now</a> from when they first debuted in the original Overwatch. For starters, players can't buy them outright, though they are included as part of the game's free and paid battle pass. An item of Rare or better quality is guaranteed to drop from each box. After opening five boxes, players are guaranteed an Epic-quality item, with a guaranteed Legendary drop after opening 20 boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes isn't the only big change as part of Overwatch 2 Season 15, Honor and Glory. It also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">shakes up Overwatch 2's gameplay in a major way with the introduction of Perks</a>, mid-match upgrades that augment a hero's abilities or even give them entirely new ones.

Achievement hunters have plenty of collectibles to chase down for these recorded memoirs.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these collectibles are easily found during your adventures, but some of them are well-hidden or tricky to complete. Here we'll guide you through each collectible category for Tape 1 of Lost Records: Bloom and Rage.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>Chapters can be replayed in Collectible mode to allow you to replay and collect without interfering with your story choices. If ever you're unsure of a chapter we mention in this guide--since the game doesn't always telegraph their names--you can use the game's scene replay feature to browse them by name and jump right to where you want to be.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Woodland_Ruins___6_collectibles_needed">Woodland Ruins - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Graffiti___10_collectibles_needed">Graffiti - 10 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</a></li><li><a href="#Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Scenic_Views___4_collectibles_needed">Scenic Views - 4 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Hunting___8_collectibles_needed">Hunting - 8 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Birds____15_collectibles_needed">Birds! - 15 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Moving_in_Place___6_collectibles_needed">Moving in Place - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Critters___6_collectibles_needed">Critters - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#More_Cat____9_collectibles_needed">More Cat! - 9 collectibles needed</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Woodland_Ruins___6_collectibles_needed">Woodland Ruins - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446601" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446601"></a><figcaption>Woodland Ruins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This category becomes available during the chapter called <strong>This Old House</strong>. All of these collectibles can be found during this chapter, as well as later trips to the cabin, but they are all pretty easy to obtain.</p><p dir="ltr">You only need six to complete this category, but you'll find more than you need. The most obvious ones being the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The deer-shaped weather vane on the roof</li><li dir="ltr">The broken bridge at the cabin</li><li dir="ltr">The wooden outhouse</li><li dir="ltr">The windchimes in nearby tree</li><li dir="ltr">The firepit at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The towels hanging on the line at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The miner's gravesite on the trail behind the cabin</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Graffiti___10_collectibles_needed">Graffiti - 10 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603"></a><figcaption>Graffiti on dumpster</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Graffiti is by far the easiest of the collectible categories to complete. You can collect these through most scenes in the game where you explore with your camcorder, but you can complete this all during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">This chapter takes Swann to the parking lot of the Movie Palace. The area is covered in graffiti, including the following areas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The graffiti marks on the fence's Do Not Enter sign</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the green dumpster near the Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">There are six different graffiti opportunities on the park benches by Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the side of the white van</li><li dir="ltr">Spray paint on the right side of the Movie Palace</li><li dir="ltr">Even more graffiti can be found on the rooftop if you take the ladder on the right side</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604"></a><figcaption>Character spotlights</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really no trick to these spotlight collectibles. Simply record 10 moments for each character. This can all be done during the chapter titled <strong>The First Night</strong>, or you can collect moments more organically throughout the entirety of Tape 1. You can work on this anytime Swann is able to record while with the girls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605"></a><figcaption>Forgotten Playground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Forgotten Playground collectibles can be earned during the chapter called <strong>The First Night</strong>. If you miss any, they can also be collected in later scenes where you visit the park, such as during Kat's memoir.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few more collectibles than you need here, but here are the main ones you'll likely find:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The seesaw</li><li dir="ltr">The marbles on the ground</li><li dir="ltr">The giant rocketship</li><li dir="ltr">The jungle gym</li><li dir="ltr">The animal-shaped spring riders</li><li dir="ltr">Swing set</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606"></a><figcaption>Filming Dylan after confrontation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The bullies category can be started early on in the game, with the very first encounter with Dylan and Corey during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mild Spoilers: </strong>If you make the same apologetic and non confrontational dialogue choices as I did when dealing with Dylan and Corey, you'll need to <strong>replay this scene in Collectible mode</strong> to get more of these. You need to pick the taunting choices, where you taunt and film Dylan, and then agree to film Corey and his bike.</p><p dir="ltr">The final bully collectibles come from an opportunity to film Corey again later in the game. This comes after near the end of the chapter titled the <strong>Abyss</strong>. This is also optional and missable. Nora will prompt you to film Corey, but the choice is yours.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607"></a><figcaption>Velvet Cove water tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is another easy category. You're basically filming the same Velvet Cove water tower throughout various scenes in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the opportunities are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Film while standing in the Movie Palace parking lot</li><li dir="ltr">Film from Swann's bedroom window in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be filmed from the park in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be seen from the bar parking lot</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608"></a><figcaption>Mothgirl placement at the end of Riot Grrrl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Mothgirl Chronicles collectible category starts during the chapter called <strong>Packing Up</strong>. This is an unmissable part of the story that takes place in Swann's bedroom, and filming Mothgirl for the first time unlocks this collectible category.</p><p dir="ltr">The remaining five collectibles require you to find a special spot where you can place Mothgirl and film. There don't seem to be any extra locations, so you'll need to replay sections if you miss these.</p><p dir="ltr">These hidden locations are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Later, during<strong> Packing Up</strong>, there is a scene with the girls at the lake, and you can place Mothgirl on a nearby rock and film her</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Double Dare</strong>, go up into the attic. You'll want to <strong>do this before you light the fireplace</strong>. Place Mothgirl on the ledge of the open section of the attic. (This collectible appears to be glitched. It lets me place Mothgirl here, but the game marks this as a location I've already recorded even though it wasn't previously recorded or in the footage.)</li><li dir="ltr">In the chapter titled <strong>Kat</strong>, you'll film an interview with her. You'll have the option to explore around the park afterwards, so make sure you <strong>grab your collectibles before telling her you're done</strong>. There are two Mothgirl locations here. Place Mothgirl on both the swing and the slide for two more collectible opportunities</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong>, you'll break into the fenced-off area of the bar. Immediately look right and place Mothgirl in the lounge chair on the right</li><li dir="ltr">After turning on the power during Riot Grrrls, run back to Nora's band setup and place Mothgirl on one of the speakers</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609"></a><figcaption>Bunny car pictured with the moo box on top of it for optional trophy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Terrible Toys memoir category requires you to film weird toys you find while on your adventures. Not all of these are available at this time, as Don't Nod told GameSpot that one of them is only found in Tape 2, coming this April, but here are the five known locations so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called The First Night, you can find a collectible when helping Kat look for the keys. You'll see a <strong>troll doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another toy can be found during The First Night chapter. When looking for something to knock down the keys, you follow Autumn into a junkyard. Here you'll find a <strong>creepy doll</strong> to film at the campsite</li><li dir="ltr">The third one you'll encounter is during the chapter called Garage Band. Inside Nora's garage you'll find a weird <strong>bunny car</strong> to film</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Grab the item sitting on top of the bunny car and inspect it. Rotating the item until it moos like a cow will <strong>unlock the hidden MOO! trophy/achievement</strong> to "Make the moo box moo."</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The next is found during chapter - Lights, Camera, Action! Before you follow your friends across the tree bridge, turn right towards the lake to find another <strong>creepy doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">The next is a <strong>voodoo doll</strong> that can be found in various times and locations. The best times to look are either during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark or This Old House. Head up into the cabin's attic to find a voodoo doll. The doll can also be found later in the story on a trail leading away from the cabin, or in a small cave entrance. It can only be counted once, though</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that since not all Terrible Toys can be found yet, it may also be the case that some other collectible categories can be finished in Tape 2, likely making those easier to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610"></a><figcaption>Strangers at the bar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are seven collectibles needed for the Strangers memoir category. The entire category is really easy to miss, depending on how you approach specific moments in the game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The first four can be discovered during the chapter called <strong>The Day We Met</strong>. Before interacting with any characters, use the ladder on the right side of the Movie Palace. You can climb up and get a view of two sets of characters. Corey and Dylan are at the back, and Nora and Autumn are at the Yooper Scooper ice cream shack. Use the camcorder to view them and then record each one as strangers</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There's a <strong>trophy/achievement you can unlock called "Dub and Dubber"</strong> by imitating the strangers as you film them. I had to imitate Corey, Dylan, and Nora before the trophy popped.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">There might be early opportunities I missed, but I got the last three strangers needed for the category recorded before the last part of the <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong> chapter.

This first-person horror game, which follows the final days of a shipwrecked space freighter crew, goes to some truly unsettling places.

                <p>Former Sony Interactive Entertainment president Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking out about his time at PlayStation on podcasts, and he recently commented about the closure of PlayStation's Japan Studio. Specifically, he said that the disappearance of the "double-A" game market was a major reason for the downfall of the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/sacred-symbols-122597374" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols podcast</a>, Yoshida stated that during his time with PlayStation, Japan Studio had "great products," but didn't have many "AAA-level successful products," other than Gran Turismo. "That became more and more important as the big games became bigger. The indies filled the gap and the double-A market seems to have disappeared. Most of the IPs that Japan Studio had were in that smaller double-A sized group, and the market became really difficult for these kinds of games."</p><p dir="ltr">He cited Gravity Rush 2 as an example, noting that its director Keiichiro Toyama pitched several ideas for a follow-up, but Japan Studio was not able to greenlight any of them due to market conditions. Yoshida noted that the closure of Japan Studio did allow Toyama to create his own studio, which eventually produced the 2024 release Slitterhead. Sony shut down Japan Studio back in April 2021. Some of the studio's best-known games include Ape Escape, the Knack series, and the Demon's Souls remake.</p><p>The remnants of Japan Studio can still be seen at Team Asobi, however. The studio, which spun off from Japan Studio, recently developed the acclaimed Astro Bot, which won The Game Awards' 2024 game of the year, among other accolades.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> developer Niantic is reportedly in discussions to sell its games division to Saudi Arabia-owned Scopely Inc for roughly $3.5 billion. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-gamings-biggest-acquisitions-ever-just-happened/1100-6513000/">Scopely was acquired</a> by Saudi Arabia owned Savvy Games in 2023 for $4.9 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-19/-pokemon-go-maker-nears-3-5-billion-deal-to-sell-games-unit?srnd=undefined" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, the deal could be announced in the coming weeks, although an agreement has not yet been made, so the deal could fall through. The deal is specifically for Niantic's games division and not the AR company in its entirety. The purchase would include Niantic's current games as well, including the highly popular Pokemon Go. Both companies declined to comment on the Bloomberg report. Niantic partnered with Savvy Games to expand Pokemon Go operations into Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Egypt (via <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/savvy-games-group-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-niantic-for-mena-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Pocketgamer.biz</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">This report comes after Niantic has struggled to find success for its titles outside of Pokemon Go. The company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-wizards-unite-is-shutting-down/1100-6497637/">Harry Potter mobile game</a> shut down in 2021 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">Niantic laid off 230 people in 2023</a> after canceling a Marvel project and shutting down NBA All-World.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia has been investing heavily in games in recent years. In 2022, it was reported that the country was looking to invest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-looking-to-invest-almost-38-billion-in-games-industry-could-acquire-a-publisher/1100-6507917/">$38 billion into video game companies</a> and it has made significant investments in companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/">Nintendo</a>. The deal to purchase Niantic's games division would be one of the larger investments the country has made in an effort to diversify the country's economic investments.</p><p>In 2024 Niantic announced that it had used Pokemon Go player data to train a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/">real-world navigation AI</a>, with the company later stating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-doesnt-want-its-ai-mapping-data-used-for-war/1100-6528057/" data-ref-id="1100-6528057">doesn't want that data used for war</a>. Recently, the company announced a partnership between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-has-announced-a-multi-year-pokemon-go-and-mlb-partnership-in-north-america/1100-6529448/" data-ref-id="1100-6529448">Major League Baseball and Pokemon Go</a> to place themed PokeStops in stadiums, in addition to some clubs hosting Pokemon Go nights during the baseball season.</p>

                <p>PlayStation and its live-service game slate have had a rough patch, with several announced games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6143">being canceled for one reason or another</a>. The Last of Us Online was one of those games that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">was canceled in 2023</a> as Naughty Dog shifted its focus to single-player games instead. That's despite it having shown promised, according to one person who got to play it.</p><p>Former Sony Interactive president Shuhei Yoshida recently spoke on the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sacred Symbols+</a> podcast (<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/yoshida-i-played-the-last-of-us-online-and-it-was-great" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Push Square</a>), where he said he liked the game when he got to try it out, but Naughty Dog realized what it would take to make it work after Bungie highlighted some oversights.</p><p>"The idea for The Last of Us Online came from Naughty Dog and they wanted to make it, but Bungie explained [to them] what it takes to make live-service games," he said. "Naughty Dog realized, 'Oops, we can't do that! If we do it, we can't make Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.' So that was a lack of foresight."</p><p>Yoshida went on to explain that, from his experience, at least, no development team at PlayStation has been forced to develop a live-service game. The studios pitch games based on the direction they believe the industry is going and develop from there.</p><p>"From my experience, when studios see the company has a big initiative, [they realize] riding on that gives them a better chance of getting a project approved and supported," he added. "It's not like [current PS Studios boss Hermen Hulst] is telling teams they need to make live-service games; it's likely mutual."</p><p>Sony recently canceled two live-service projects from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Bluepoint and Bend Studio</a>, including a reported God of War title. At the time of the cancelation of The Last of Us Online, Naughty Dog explained that supporting the game would have required too many of its resources and it would no longer be able to make single-player games.</p><p>"To release and support The Last of Us Online we’d have to put all our studio resources behind supporting post-launch content for years to come, severely impacting development on future single-player games," the statement <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">read</a>. "So, we had two paths in front of us: Become a solely live service games studio or continue to focus on single-player narrative games that have defined Naughty Dog’s heritage."</p>
