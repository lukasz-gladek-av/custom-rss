                <p>There's an ongoing debate as to whether Microsoft's Game Pass hurts or helps sales of titles that are available on the service. But as far as id Software co-founder and Doom co-creator John Romero is concerned, Game Pass is beneficial to the video game industry.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/doom-creator-loves-xbox-game-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">True Achievements</a>, Romero was recently interviewed by <a href="https://youtu.be/sBOMxyuyQeQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Expansion Pass</a>, and he was effusive with his praise for Game Pass.</p><p>"I love it," said Romero. "I mean, who doesn't love Game Pass? It's Netflix for games; who doesn't want that? It's great because it's try before you buy... one thing after another thing. Really the barrier for people to play games is just access to those games. Even free-to-play games, it's like, knowing that those games exist, and Game Pass is like 'Here they are!'"</p><p>Romero went on to add that Game Pass "doesn't hurt the game companies that made those games," because players get to experience titles more quickly even if they don't keep them. It's unclear if Romero feels this way even about games that launch on Game Pass at the same time that they hit stores. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> was seemingly unaffected by its availability on Game Pass, and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">the top-selling game in America for 2024</a>. Conversely, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> only debuted at No. 14 on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/indiana-jones-enters-the-20-best-selling-games-in-the-us-for-december-but-black-ops-6-is-still-no-1/2900-6157/" data-ref-id="2900-6157">December 2024's list of best-selling games</a>. That game may have also been hampered by the fact that its PlayStation 5 port won't arrive until later this spring.</p><p>Although Romero didn't work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, that title will be a day-one release on Game Pass when it arrives on May 15. And unlike Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, it will also be hitting PlayStation 5 at the same time as its debut on Xbox Series X|S.</p>

The year's first big patch will release in February, adding a new map, a new Tyranid enemy, and Absolute difficulty.</p><p>Focus Entertainment revealed its roadmap for the game via a community update on <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/145-january-community-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its official forum</a>. The post opens by addressing community complaints about a lack of updates, it then clarifies that updates can be expected every two months. The post adds, "We’d love to do more, but we’re committed to delivering polished updates, which takes time and care!" Take a look at the official "year one" roadmap below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4435917-spacemarine2_roadmap_yearonebattleplan_3840x2160_new.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435917" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4435917-spacemarine2_roadmap_yearonebattleplan_3840x2160_new.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435917"></a><figcaption>A Year One Battle Plan for Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, showing what elements will arrive in future updates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4435917-spacemarine2_roadmap_yearonebattleplan_3840x2160_new.jpg"></figure><p>The roadmap indicates that players can expect a few substantial updates in the coming months. Releasing sometime during the Space Marine 2's third season, Patch 7 will add a new PvP mission, custom PvP lobbies, PvE Prestige ranks, and a new weapon. Updates in spring will bring a Horde Mode, a new enemy, a new PvP arena, a new PvP mode, and new weapons. The post also promises that the game will continue to receive support after 2025.</p><p>The community update also outlines what players can expect for February's patch. First of all, it adds a new map called Tomb, which is set below the surface of the planet Delerium inside a Necron catacomb. The patch's new enemy is called a Biovore, a scorpion-like artillery enemy that shoots Spore Mines. It can be found on any map which includes Tyranids. In the new datavault, players can unlock information on game elements and new cosmetics by spending a new currency, earned through completing in-game achievements. The update also adds emotes, more cosmetics, a perks rework, and an FOV slider.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-company-looking-for-the-next-one-after-big-success-of-space-marine-2/1100-6528795/" data-ref-id="1100-6528795">Space Marine 2 was a big success for Warhammer creators Games Workshop</a> and it is looking for its next hit title. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">Amazon's Warhammer series</a> may soon be entering active development.
