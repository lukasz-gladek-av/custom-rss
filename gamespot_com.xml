                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch users are reporting that some recently purchased Switch games have arrived with the game cartridge missing from inside the box. Even odder, the cartridges appear to have been swapped out forâ€¦ googly eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the holidays, posts about the bizarre phenomenon began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hnl1c4/didnt_see_this_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">popping up on social media</a>. Multiple players have shared photos of freshly unwrapped Switch game cases holding a lone googly eye in the spot where the game itself should be.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Grinch got us this year," reads one Reddit post featuring a photo of a Super Mario Party Jamboree case with a lone googly eye in the space meant for the game cartridge.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not clear how widespread the issue is, nor is it clear who the culprit is. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hllexj/comment/m3n7lga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">players suspect that warehouse workers</a> somewhere along the supply chain are snatching the cartridges (likely with the intent to resell them) and replacing them with a googly eye so the weight of the missing cartridge goes unnoticed, or for the purpose of making sure the box sounds like it still has a game inside it when shaken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the exact source of the missing game cartridges remains unknown, multiple comments and posts mention purchasing a Switch game from Walmart and finding nothing but a googly eye inside, suggesting one of the retail giant's warehouses may be the source of the problem.</p><p dir="ltr">One Reddit user says they've fallen victim to the googly eye switcheroo multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bought Tears of the Kingdom at a Walmart in Arizona, and this happened to me," they wrote. "Walmart refused to refund/replace, blaming Nintendo. Had to twist their arms a bit, but Nintendo eventually gave me a digital copy of the game. Recently, I went to Walmart to buy PokÃ©mon Violet. I asked if the clerk would watch me open it because I told them about what happened with TotK. Bro was beside himself when I cracked it open to reveal yet another googly eye. They swapped out the game for another (which we also checked)."</p><p dir="ltr">Neither Walmart nor Nintendo have commented on the issue. For now, an issue at Walmart warehouses or distribution centers seems to be the likeliest culprit. But it's also possible that Santa simply ran out of coal this year.</p>

                <p>Between massive open-world games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, or live-service titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-season-1-start-date-new-heroes-new-map-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-6101/" data-ref-id="2900-6101">Marvel Rivals</a>, there are no shortage of games that can eat up players' free time. And that's why the industry may have reached a tipping point with its seemingly endless games, according to Bethesda veteran Will Shen.</p><p>Shen--who was previously the lead quest designer on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">Starfield</a>--recently shared his thoughts about players being put off from jumping into large games during his appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCYpt9Zg7cM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwi Talkz</a>. He accepted that some of his previous Bethesda titles, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review/1900-6344622/" data-ref-id="1900-6344622">Skyrim</a>, which "you can play pretty much forever, " may have contributed to player fatigue. However, Shen contends that the oversaturation of giant games leaves players without enough time to fully invest in new titles.</p><p>"We're reaching a point where people are fatigued, or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game," explained Shen. "Because they already have that. They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It's always a tall order."</p><p>Shen pointed to the success of shorter games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> and Mouthwashing as titles that can be easily enjoyed by players without having to invest massive of amounts of time. He also suggested that the short length of those games allows more players to create a community around them because they've all been able "to engage fully with the entirety of the product."</p><p>The long AAA titles go hand-in-hand with the escalating budgets for video games. Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently revealed that one of the reasons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/" data-ref-id="1100-6528634">he agreed to sell his company to Sony</a> was to prevent the massive development costs from sinking everything he and his team had built prior to 2001. Those rising expenses also contributed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">to the devastating job losses</a> in the video game industry last year.</p>

Recently, one user by the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BALTOBOULBOBBI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltoboulbobbi</a> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/what-happens-if-you-install-every-wow-classic-addon-358339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">(via Wowhead)</a> took it on themselves to see what exactly would happen if they tried to play the game with every add-on installed all at the same time. The brave soul installed 3,703 WoW Classic add-ons all at once and documented their experience in a seven minute video that is equal parts hilarious and existential nightmare. Some add-ons had to be immediately disabled due to them pushing Baltoboulbobbi over their 16GB RAM limit, while others had to be turned off as they prevented the game from running entirely. That left them with 3,683 add-ons running at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Things instantly get out of hand. Immediately upon logging in, they first attempt to click out of as many windows obstructing their view as possible, only to discover over 100 add-ons in the middle of the screen that can't be removed. Much of the screen is occupied by various menus, health bars, and charts. Nearly every action they take is accompanied by random sounds, ranging from farts, quotes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shobek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic streamer Shobek</a>, or cries of "Finish Him!" ripped Mortal Kombat. Leveling up is even more outrageous. Overall, Baltoboulbobbi is able to level up a few times and complete a few quests before the game crashes, putting an end to the ambitious experiment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Baltoboulbobbi's user interface upon booting up WoW Classic with 3,683 add-ons running.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the comments, Baltoboulbobbi pledged to attempt to do a 1-60 leveling challenge on WoW Classic's Hardcore permadeath server with all add-ons installed if their video eclipsed more than 20,000 views. The video has now been viewed more than 100,000 times, and Baltoboulbobbi has made good on their promise, having done several live streamed sessions of them attempting the feat so far.</p><p dir="ltr">What's even scarier is that while Baltoboulbobbi nearly installed every WoW Classic add-on available, there are far, far more add-ons available for download for the modern version of WoW. According to CurseForge, there are over 10,000 add-ons for WoW's current The War Within expansion, and one shutters at the thought of what would happen were someone to try and run them all at once.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-is-finally-getting-fresh-servers-as-cataclysm-players-move-to-pandaria/1100-6527720/" data-ref-id="1100-6527720">WoW Classic recently received fresh servers in celebration of the game's 20th anniversary</a>.
