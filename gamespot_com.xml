                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> got off to a hot start earlier in 2025 with 10 million copies sold in its first month before suffering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-expansion-is-coming-sooner-than-expected-after-suffering-underwhelming-sales/1100-6533593/" data-ref-id="1100-6533593">a dramatic decline in sales</a> as well as lingering performance issues on PC. Now, Capcom is warning players that the impending conclusion of support for Windows 10 means that three of the most recent Monster Hunter games will no longer be guaranteed to work on that operating system.</p><p>Capcom shared a message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/544495527868236777" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that reminded players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-ditches-32-bit-support-as-windows-10-nears-its-end/1100-6534864/" data-ref-id="1100-6534864">Microsoft is ending support for Windows 10</a> on October 14. Consequently, the publisher states, "we will no longer guarantee that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-world/" data-ref-id="5000-465583">Monster Hunter: World</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-rise/" data-ref-id="5000-519025">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and Monster Hunter Wilds will run on Windows 10 systems."</p><p>The publisher went on to say that the games will still be playable on that operating system after that date. But any future game updates for those titles may render them incompatible with Windows 10 machines.</p><p>A Capcom executive recently blamed Monster Hunter Wilds' drop in sales on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-high-price-is-impacting-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-capcom-exec-says/1100-6534430/" data-ref-id="1100-6534430">the high price of PS5 </a>consoles. Capcom acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-monster-hunter-wilds-update-finally-addresses-poor-pc-performance/1100-6532814/" data-ref-id="1100-6532814">the game's problems on PC</a> in June, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sees-huge-jump-in-pc-players-after-free-title-update-2/1100-6532910/" data-ref-id="1100-6532910">Wilds saw a surge in players</a> after a subsequent update. Capcom dropped another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> last month, but the game's larger PC issues won't be directly addressed until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Capcom debuted a crossover collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-new-update-adds-final-fantasy-14-jobs-and-more/1100-6535012/" data-ref-id="1100-6535012">Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14</a>, which was released earlier this week. The publisher also teased the return of the elder dragon Gogmazios in December's Free Title Update 4.</p>

                <p>A new firmware update--Version: 25.06-12.02.00--for the PlayStation 5 console has gone live, and unsurprisingly, it doesn't do much. What this new update does is improve the security on your device, but don't expect to see any new major features added to your PS5 once it has been installed.</p><p>"We've made some security fixes to the system software," reads the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-za/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very succinct update notes</a>. There have been several other updates to the console throughout 2025, with notable examples being the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-brings-back-classic-console-ui-designs/1100-6531058/">return of the classic PlayStation console user interfaces</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ps5-update-brings-big-changes-to-activity-settings/1100-6530365/">big changes to activity settings</a>. Beyond that, 2025 has been a year of incremental improvements and tweaks to the PS5 user experience.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, this year marks the 30th anniversary of the first system's launch in the US and Europe, and to celebrate, Sony has unveiled new collectibles. Gaming historians will want to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-history-book-announced-preorders-available-now/1100-6535087/">PlayStation: The First 30 Years</a>, a deluxe book chronicling the creation of the very first PlayStation console.</p><p>Anyone looking to celebrate in style <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/look-at-these-new-30th-anniversary-playstation-shoes/1100-6535089/">can also preorder new shoes</a> soon that "pay homage" to the PlayStation and are packaged inside of limited-edition boxes meant to evoke the console's original design.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei</a> also launches for PS5 on October 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-free-games-for-october-2025-revealed/1100-6535000/">and if you have a PS Plus subscription</a>, you can pick up Alan Wake 2, Goat Simulator 3, and Cocoon next week. Even more PlayStation classics are coming to PlayStation Plus Premium this year. Sony announced that Soul Calibur 3, Tekken 3, and Tomb Raider: Anniversary will be added to the Game Catalog for PS Plus Premium subscribers soon.</p>

                <p>With so many studios under one umbrella, Microsoft has one of the biggest back catalogs of game franchises in the industry, if not the biggest. And yet, certain titles stand out among the countless many. In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6NtohaoBBo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN Japan</a>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer talked about some of the most-requested revivals, among a variety of other topics.</p><p>Spencer noted in the interview that the most highly requested titles from the Microsoft back-catalog are Japanese RPGs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-dragon/" data-ref-id="5000-24199">Blue Dragon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-24409">Lost Odyssey</a>, and Western titles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-skies/" data-ref-id="5000-2603">Crimson Skies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mechassault/" data-ref-id="5000-4349">MechAssault</a>.</p><p>Both Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey are RPGs originally developed by Mistwalker, the studio started by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy/" data-ref-id="5000-3726">Final Fantasy</a> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, formerly of Square Enix. Blue Dragon was Mistwalker's very first project, and featured character designs by Akira Toriyama (Dragon Ball, Dragon Quest. Lost Odyssey, meanwhile, featured character designs by Takehiko Inoue (Slam Dunk, Vagabond). Inoue isn't as well known in the West as Toriyama, but both are equally big names in Japan, making these both standout series for Japanese fans.</p><p>Crimson Skies and MechAssault, meanwhile, both originated in the early days of the original Xbox, when Microsoft partnered with FASA, the then-publisher of BattleTech, Shadowrun, and others. Crimson Skies was an action-flight game set in an alternate history version of 1930s America, in which flight is a primary method of transportation and combat. MechAssault is an action-shooter featuring the mechs from BattleTech, and was one of the very first games with Xbox Live functionality.</p><p>As to whether we could see these titles come back, the JRPGs are far more feasible, as Mistwalker is still an active studio and owns both franchises. Regarding the Western titles, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-lead-phil-spencer-reveals-the-4-most-requested-franchise-revivals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central notes</a> that Microsoft added Crimson Skies to its backwards-compatibility program some years ago, but did not add MechAssault. So while both games seem tied up in rights issues--Topps now owns the rights to FASA's properties--Crimson Skies is the greater possibility. </p><p>In addition to discussing these most-requested franchises, Spencer also talked about the choice to set Forza Horizon 6 in Japan, the most requested setting in the series' 13-year history, which he attributed to the nation's "fantastic" topography. He also spoke briefly about the partnerships Xbox has with Japanese studios for games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/beast-of-reincarnation/" data-ref-id="5000-681579">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, but said that he'd let those teams speak about their projects.</p>
