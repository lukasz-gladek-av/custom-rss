                <p>As hype continues to mount for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, a reliable leaker has discovered possible more information about the open-world game that appears to reference parody websites.</p><p><a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tez2 said in the GTA forums</a> that they recently came across website domains registered on May 27 under Rockstar owner Take-Two that appear to be related to GTA 6. The domains are for things like "what-up.app," "Rydeme.app," and "hookers-galore.com," along with "myboyhasacreepycorndog.com" and "leonidagov.org." People are theorizing that these are domains related to in-game websites.</p><p>None of them are currently online and available to visit, but some believe they will eventually redirect to the main GTA 6 website. Here is the full list of what Tez2 discovered:</p><ul><li>what-up.app</li><li>rydeme.app</li><li>buckme.app</li><li>leonidagov.org</li><li>brianandbradley.com</li><li>hookers-galore.com</li><li>wipeoutcornskin.com</li><li>myboyhasacreepycorndog.com</li></ul><p>Importantly, these domain registrations might not be related to GTA 6 or anything at all, but they certainly do fit the tone of GTA. GTA 4 and GTA 5 also featured in-game websites, including parodies of popular brands.</p><p>In particular, people believe "what-up" might be GTA 6's version of WhatsApp and "leonidagov.org" could be a reference to Leonida, which is the setting of GTA 6 and itself a version of Florida. The "RydeMe" reference could be a reference to Uber or Lyft. It's anyone's guess what "myboyhasacreepycorndog" could be related to.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">Tez2 previously leaked a GTA 4 remaster</a>, but it's yet to be confirmed by Rockstar.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">shared loads of details about the game in May this year to help ease the pain of the delay</a>, but the company hasn't said a word about GTA 6 since then. Other companies have discussed GTA 6, however, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">Ghost of Yotei developer Sucker Punch recently saying the team celebrated when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Localizing video games can be challenging, and in the case of Animal Crossing, bringing the distinctly Japanese social-sim to the West in 2002 proved to be a Herculean labor. One of the big obstacles was renaming the game, as its Japanese title of Dōbutsu no Mori had to be changed for its Western release.</p><p>The entire localization job took between six months and a year to complete, former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan said to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, and one of the proposed titles was Animal Acres, a name that was inspired by the grids of the town. This was ultimately rejected by Nintendo, with the title of Animal Crossing being approved instead.</p><p>The late Satoru Iwata--who was the head of Nintendo's corporate planning division at that time--laughed when he heard that Swan and her team were working on the English localization. Game producer Takashi Tezuka had also warned the team about taking on the task, as they'd need to not only translate thousands of lines of text, but also rename characters, come up with new catchphrases for them, and figure out how to adapt Japanese-specific themes for Western audiences.</p><p>"I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter," Swan said. "He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><p>The last Animal Crossing game, New Horizons, was released in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">and it recently got a Switch 2 update</a>. The future of the franchise remains a mystery--even in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic helping to turn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/">New Horizons into a massive hit for Nintendo</a>--but you can bring the game and your favorite villagers everywhere with you as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs are now available to order</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong's first patch has been announced, and it makes the game easier, at least somewhat. The new update includes a "slight difficulty reduction" for the early-game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter. Additionally, Sandcarvers will do less damage.</p><p>The new Silksong patch also includes a variety of fixes. Players should no longer get stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles, while Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper could previously get stuck out of bounds but that should be fixed now.</p>

                <p>2017's Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is one of the last decade's best first-person shooters, blending brutal combat with a Nazi-hunting story that sees protagonist BJ Blazkowicz come face to face with Adolf Hitler himself. For those who have played the game, you likely remember this pivotal scene, but according to the development team, it also could have been a penile scene.</p><p>That's right: If it weren't for higher-ups at Bethesda, the game would have shown Hitler's weird penis.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-poured-cold-water-on-hitlers-penis-appearing-in-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), MachineGames studio director Jerk Gustatfsson revealed the (tiny) tidbit of information while discussing the creation of the game. It would have occurred when Hitler was urinating in a bucket (which did make it into the game) as Blazkowicz prepared to deliver his lines in a film audition.</p><p>Game director Jens Matthies added that he asked a production executive at Bethesda about this idea, and was advised not to do it--so we were left only seeing Hitler violently vomiting and peeing haphazardly into a bucket.</p><p>Perhaps that was for the best, as Hitler--whose role in WW2 ended with a big hole in his head--reportedly had a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53818-hitler-micropenis.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">very weird wiener</a>, as well. We'll spare you the details here, but suffice it to say, there's a reason why he was missing the bucket so much in that scene.</p><p>For more on Hitler's genitalia, you can check out the Sniper Elite series. The games have long included a bonus DLC mission in which you can destroy the dictator, and if you choose to do so via a shot to the groin, you'll see a single testicle.</p><p>MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle released last year, and its DLC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-review/1900-6418404/" data-ref-id="1900-6418404">The Order of Giants</a> is available now. It remains to be seen when we'll get a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-dev-hopes-to-return-to-the-franchise/1100-6534556/" data-ref-id="1100-6534556">third full-length Wolfenstein game</a>, though the spin-off Youngblood did suggest we'll be playing as a much older BJ Blazkowicz when it eventually arrives.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
