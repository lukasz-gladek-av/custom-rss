                <p>It's been a busy week for industry speculation after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">Geoff Keighley started posting </a>about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/">moved into Los Angeles</a>. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-mysterious-monolith-is-not-for-lords-of-the-fallen-2/1100-6536750/">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">all shot down</a> by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.</p><p dir="ltr">A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="4304" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211"></a><figcaption>The logos trademarked bear a striking resemblance to the monolith's imagery.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A recent PlayStation Store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">database leak revealed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> is getting a Definitive Edition release on the PS5, but it's likely that the statue and the new trademark filings relate to a brand new title in the Divinity series.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is not far away now, airing on December 11 live from Los Angeles. Despite being over two years old now, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 is up for an award again, earning another nomination for Best Community Support. This year's frontrunner looks to be Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which earned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-nominees-ranked-by-how-many-nominations-they-received/2900-7267/">record-breaking 12 nominations</a>.

                <p>Amazon has opened preorders for CRKD's next Gibson Guitar Controller.

Notably, this is the first wireless guitar controller in CRKD's catalog licensed by PlayStation. The Gibson SG syncs wirelessly to PS5, PS4, PS3, and PC via a 2.4GHz dongle. The multiplatform version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DZ71SS97,B0DZ746LB9,B0DZ715FM4,B0DZ73PJNF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller</a> is limited to a wired connection on PS5 and PS4, so the Gibson SG is likely the better option for Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 players on PlayStation.</p><p>PS5 players now have two officially licensed wireless guitar controllers to choose from.

The original Gibson SG had a red body and black pick guard, whereas the new model has a black body, white pick guard, and brown neck. Still, it's rather fitting that the first officially licensed Gibson controller for PS5 pays homage to the most recognizable guitar in Guitar Hero history.</p><p>The 20th Anniversary Edition has Matte EZ Glide Mechanical Frets with RGB backlighting, a Hall Effect strum bar with the classic "clicking" feedback, a whammy bar, and a tilt sensor to activate Star Power. Like the Les Paul editions, the SG has a modular design with a removable neck. The controller's D-pad is located on the back of the headstock. The eight-button Navigation Hub has PlayStation input labels and a Hall Effect stick in the center. The dial with the PlayStation logo switches between wireless and wired connections, while the white dial lets you activate KEYJAM and Legacy modes. Legacy mode lets you use the controller wirelessly on PS3 to play old Rock Band and Guitar Hero games.</p><p>According to CRKD's compatibility list, KEYJAM mode on the SG is different from the Les Paul. It's likely due to the PlayStation license, but KEYJAM seems to only work for PlayStation consoles and PC. The Les Paul multiplatform guitars can play Fortnite Festival in wired mode on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in KEYJAM mode. It's also worth noting the Les Paul multiplatform editions support Switch 1/2 with wireless and wired connections and have Legacy mode for PS3. Both models support Bluetooth connections for mobile devices and are compatible with CRKD's free customization app.</p><p>Here's what you'll find inside the box:</p><ul><li>Black SG Guitar Controller Body</li><li>Brown OG Signature Pro Fret Neck</li><li>Black Shoulder Strap</li><li>2.4GHz Wireless Dongle</li><li>8.2-foot USB-C Cable</li><li>Removable Rechargeable Battery</li><li>KEYJAM Nav Hub Sticker</li><li>Quickstart Guide</li></ul></div>                      </div><h2>All CRKD Gibson Guitar Controllers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620121"></a><figcaption>CRKD Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg"></figure><p>The Gibson SG's $135 price point matches the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DZ715FM4,B0DZ73PJNF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Les Paul Blueberry Burst Pro</a> that's officially licensed by Microsoft for Xbox consoles.

It's worth noting that the Blueberry Burst Pro Editions have strum bars with haptic feedback. Last month, CRKD released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gibson-Sunburst-Controller-Collectors-Multi-platform-Desktop/dp/B0FWDCJT46?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Les Paul Cherry Sunburst Pro Collector's Bundle</a> for $200.
