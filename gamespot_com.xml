                <p>EA has been revealing a ton of detail about the changes and additions it's bringing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and today it revealed its stadium rankings. Taking into account crowds, noise, and "hostile atmosphere," EA has produced a list of the toughest stadiums in college football for visiting teams.</p><p>Part of EA's focus on improving its representation of the traditions, spirit, and overall vibes of particular campuses, this list of tough stadiums is probably not going to be too surprising to most college football fans. LSU's infamously loud and hostile Tiger Stadium, for instance, comes in at the top spot, and most of the rest of the SEC is not too far behind. Aligned with college football stereotypes and memes, you're not going to find any California schools on the list. However, college football fans are nothing if not ferociously loyal, so I'm sure this list will still find a way to spark heated debate. You can see the full list below.</p>

In addition, the publisher is giving away the remastered original game as a bonus for preordering. </p><p><span>Alongside the release date, the publisher also released a new trailer, which you can see in the embed below.

The Enhanced Edition has improved graphics and performance, allowing the game to run at 4K/60fps and boasting features like ray-tracing and volumetric lighting. The remaster is unlocked as soon as you place your preorder. If you already own the original game, you'll get a free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition on October 10. </p><p>Little Nightmares III is slated for release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, the original Nintendo Switch, and now also Switch 2. On PlayStation and Xbox, the standard edition costs $40, while the Deluxe Edition will run you $60 and comes with some additional in-game content (right now, the Steam preorder is $60 for standard and $80 for Deluxe, and it is unclear if this discrepancy is intentional or not). While it'll likely be familiar to fans of the series, Little Nightmares III makes a big change with the addition of co-op--a bold choice, and one that we thought showed promise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-little-nightmares-3-the-addition-of-co-op-might-actually-make-the-game-scarier/1100-6526294/" data-ref-id="1100-6526294">we previewed the game last year</a>.</p>

                <p>Fan-made video games based on popular franchises always run the risk of having the official rights-holder step in and shut things down, but that's not happening with Spartan Survivors.</p><p>The community-developed game, which has players fighting hordes of Covenant and Flood enemies as Master Chief or the Arbiter, has been given an official blessing from Microsoft. The developers <a href="https://x.com/SpartnSurvivors/status/1937572095573283004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Microsoft reached out to them to say they "really love to see the passion" from the team. People at Microsoft apparently played the game as well. "It really is fun and we look forward to getting further in our playthrough and unlocking more stuff," the Halo representative said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuvhdWvzVw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJuvhdWvzVw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft, did, however, have one specific request for the developers. Microsoft reportedly asked the team to add language to the legal disclaimer in the game's credits and on store pages to make it ultra-clear that the project is not an official Halo game or made in partnership with Halo Studios.</p><p>This language will be added in the next update to Spartan Survivors. "We want to thank Halo Studios and Microsoft for their real sympathy toward us," the studio said.</p><p>You can <a href="https://juanggz.itch.io/spartan-survivors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Spartan Survivors today on itch.io</a> for free. The game's store page mentions that it's also coming to Xbox and Steam in 2025, but as of yet, it's unclear when that might happen. The announcement trailer can be seen above, containing the outdated language mentioning a 2024 release.</p><p>Microsoft is moving ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">its own new Halo games</a>, which are in the works at the newly rebranded Halo Studios and will run on Unreal Engine 5. Many are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">expecting some kind of big Halo release in 2026 for the franchise's 25th anniversary</a>, but as of yet, we don't know what that could be.</p>

                <p>The latest update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> comes out tomorrow, and it adds free new content alongside numerous tweaks and improvements. Title Update 1.0.6 is headlined by a quest developed in collaboration with Critical Role, as well as a new, more challenging difficulty setting.</p><p>The update's new questline is called A Critical Encounter, and its narrative centers around Rufino, a character first created during Critical Role's one-off Assassin's Creed-themed series. Rufino is voice-acted by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond, and completion of the quest unlocks Rufino as an Ally. In addition to this quest, Ubisoft is also adding a Critical Role-themed weapon pack that can be purchased in the in-game store.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p>The update also adds a new Nightmare difficulty setting, designed to significantly increase the challenge that players face. Nightmare increases enemy skill and decreases the effectiveness of player abilities; enemies are not only stronger, but also faster and smarter, according to the patch notes. Players will also have to be more careful about noise; on this setting, Naoe will make a sound even while crouching.</p><p>Along with these two big content additions, the update adds a bunch of changes and tweaks to improve the game. For instance, players can now opt to remove headgear during cutscenes; Ubisoft has also added a toggle for specific VFX. Title Update 1.0.6 launches tomorrow, June 25, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 2 PM UTC; You can check out the whole list of changes in the patch notes below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to unlock Critical Role's Rufino as an Ally (image via Ubisoft). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first big collaboration that Ubisoft has done for Shadows. Back in May, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-update-adds-two-unexpected-crossovers-and-major-parkour-upgrades/1100-6531829/" data-ref-id="1100-6531829">launched collabs with Dead By Daylight and Balatro</a>. The company plans for more content to come in the future: According to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>, future updates will add new game plus, additional story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Patch sizes</h3><ul><li>PS5: ~6.27 GB</li><li>Xbox Series X|S: ~19 GB</li><li>Mac: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~17 GB</li><li>Steam: ~8.5 GB</li></ul><h3>Patch Highlights</h3><h4>Critical Role</h4><p>For our second special collaboration, we partnered with Critical Role to bring this new content to Assassin's Creed Shadows. This includes a new free quest called "A Critical Encounter," a new Ally to recruit and a new trophy/achievement to add to your collection.</p><h4>New Free Story Pack: "A Critical Encounter"</h4><p>Rufino, an old friend of Tomiko and Heiji, calls in a life debt after uncovering a deadly conspiracy. While working as a translator, he discovered evidence that a secretive organization has been hiring assassins to eliminate influential commoners.</p><p>Now, he turns to Naoe and Yasuke for help in stopping these killers.</p><p>Unlock conditions: Complete "Way of the Blacksmith" and unlock Yasuke as a playable character. This questline will start in the Hideout.</p><ul><li>Reward: New Ally based on Critical Role's Assassin's Creed Shadows One-Shot campaign character, Rufino, played by Robbie Daymond. You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li>New Trophy/Achievement: "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><p>With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke.</p><h4>New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h4><p>We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience.</p><p>Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:</p><ul><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.  <ul><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit--imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.  <ul><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries--only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h4>Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h4><p>We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too!</p><p>You will find the option available in the in-game settings.</p><ul><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h4>VFX Toggles</h4><p>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more.</p><p>All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.</p><h4>Open World Alarm</h4><p>We have expanded the Regional Alert System available in Castles to the whole Province. Now by repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.</p><h4>Horse Camera Presets</h4><p>You can now toggle between 3 different camera presets while riding on your mount (hold the down button on controller/'X' key on keyboard while riding) allowing for a more cinematic experience to take in the full beauty of Japan.</p><h4>Ultra Low Specs for PC</h4><p>We are adding a new visual quality level, the Ultra Low mode. This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions.</p><h3>List of Bug Fixes</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Onryo Mask remained visible despite selecting the option to hide gear.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to earn Mastery Points.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Mastery Points were not returned after resetting the Mastery Tree.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not switch characters anymore even without gameplay context restrictions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where allies could be trained to veteran rank without upgrading the dojo to level 3.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gennojo did not immediately appear in the hideout after recruitment. <em>He was busy washing his hair!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player remains stuck in a Red Zone, without being able to fast travel anywhere, by allowing them to fast travel to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Oni Drawing remains stuck on screen after completing the "Vision of the Realms" quest.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h4>Quests</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "A Chance Encounter" quest when following Fuyu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the quest after defeating all Kabukimono.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lady Oichi's letter became unavailable after the Fuji-maru cutscene.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to talk to Katsuhime in the crop field when she was sitting on the ground. <em>She just wanted some peace and quiet!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where tracking the "Temple Stories" quest only showed a progress bar with no text.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Genzaburo's Teppo Master was missing from the Kaya Shrine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yagyu Munetoshi revealed a later plot point too early in the "Nobutsuna's Students" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not assassinate the Godai of Void because the NPC was missing. <em>He took his name too seriously.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest after dodge rolling and dropping Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest when there was no immediate option to carry Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players glitched through an anomaly in the "Heads Will Roll" quest, making Animus activities unavailable.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "Lost Honor" quest because the game failed to switch to Naoe.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress through the Tournament after dying.</li></ul><h4>Visuals &amp; Graphics</h4><ul><li>Fixed some minor visual issues.</li><li>Fixed misplaced visual elements with the Dark Woods Kusarigama.</li><li>Fixed an issue where all NPC horses appeared as identical.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with Naoe's Sekiryu outfit.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the "Bloodshade Katana" being visible out of the sheath when transmogged.</li><li>Fixed a movement physics issue with the Dead by Daylight Oni's armor.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where footstep audio occasionally ceased when opening the map while moving.</li></ul>
