                <p>Stray Kite Studios--an indie developer that includes veterans from BioShock, Borderlands, and Age of Empires--has debuted the first look at the company's inaugural original title Wartorn. As seen in the trailer below, the game thrusts players into the lives of two elven sisters who are trying to survive long enough to reunite with their family. And they'll have to make some tough decisions along the way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tt1bNPFk0U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2tt1bNPFk0U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Combat will play a major role in their journey, but it won't be the only thing that impacts their fate. Stray Kite indicated that the sisters will "confront moral dilemmas and battle external and internal threats." Luckily, they aren't powerless in this fantasy world.</p><p>"Wartorn challenges players to navigate the chaos of a divided world while finding purpose and joy in selflessness," Stary Kite Studios creative director Paul Hellquist said in a statement. "We've poured our hearts into creating a game that not only entertains, but also makes players think deeply about sacrifice, survival, and the bonds that unite us."</p><p>The studio also touted the destructible environments as well as the dynamic combat system that puts the elements of water, fire, and electricity in the hands of the players. Wartorn's roguelike progression system will offer upgrades, items, and new abilities that will carry over to each run. Players can also slow down time to keep their characters from being overwhelmed in the heat of battle.</p><p>Prior to this game, Stray Kite Studios worked with Gearbox and 2K Tiny Tina’s Assault on Dragon Keep: A Wonderlands One-Shot Adventure. The studio has also created minigames through Fortnite Creative.</p><p>Wartorn will be available in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1296660/Wartorn/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and Epic Game Store in Spring 2025.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25/">Madden NFL</a> is touted as having new and exciting presentation elements with every new installment in the series. These elements, such as commentary, field-level camera work, and halftime shows, are inconsistent at best and tend to leave a lot to be desired, especially when you compare them to the same aspects of games like NBA 2K and MLB The Show. But the latest presentation gaffe in Madden 25 feels like a strangely unforced error.</p><p dir="ltr">In the most recent patch, the EA Orlando team introduced the Team Pass, a new battle pass-like cosmetic rewards tree that offers both free and paid unlockables that amount to player banner customization options. You can unlock things like profile pictures, backgrounds, and borders, just like you can in Call of Duty or many other games. These cosmetics are all centered around one particular team of a player's choosing and are meant to be proudly displayed in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">In practice, this means the scorebug in any game replaces the logo of the team you're playing as with imagery based on the team you chose in the Team Pass. This is a reasonably innocuous feature for game modes like the arcadey Superstar Showdown and the fantasy-sports-inspired Ultimate Team (MUT). However, forcing this cosmetic change in Franchise mode quickly becomes an eyesore given players are tied to the hip with one particular team--and not necessarily the same team as that in their Team Pass--and are much more likely to be interested in simulating the product they see on TV.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326" data-ratio="0.51203007518797" data-width="1330" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428326"></a><figcaption>Sit down; the Atlanta Jets and New Orleans Rob Lowes game is on. (Image credit: CouchCoach16 on Twitch)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428326-image.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can't change your chosen team once you've opted into the Team Pass, though the game suggests a new Team Pass will be sold in a few months during the next live-service season. The Team Pass seems built on the assumption that players will choose their favorite team and that it will be the same team they tend to use in various game modes. It's arguably a fair assumption some of the time, but Franchise is a mode in which players often purposely take on a team other than the one close to their heart.</p><p dir="ltr">Maybe they want a rebuilding project, or they want to create a custom team in a new city with a new name and uniforms, or maybe, like in the case of my online league, there are 32 players and few of us will get our favorite team. My league plays year-round, switching to the latest Madden every August. Our teams become our identity. To have an unrelated team tied to our long-term persona is a jarring feature the moment you first see it on the screen. Why would I want a team other than the one I'm controlling and the one I'm facing to be featured on the scorebug?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329" data-ratio="0.22666666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428329"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the strange new presentation decision by the Madden team. Previously, you'd see Falcons and Saints logos here. Now, neither is visible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428329-jets.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the worst case, the scorebug now features up to four teams: the two teams playing each other, identified by their three-letter abbreviation, and as many as two more teams that have overtaken the team logo spaces and replaced them with potentially several extravagant cosmetics. I don't know how it got through testing. It's kind of like if the scorebug's remaining timeout nodes were changed to various emojis. Can I figure it out soon enough? Yeah, sure. But does it improve anything? Does it make sense? Does it look nice, the way cosmetic options for sale within a game should? Nope. Nobody looked at a game between the Steelers and Ravens in which the scorebug suggests--in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect" rel="nofollow ">Stroop test</a> fashion--it's actually the Seahawks and Patriots and thought something was wrong?</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly perplexing is what happens if you opt out of the Team Pass entirely. The game then applies a default logo to your profile, the NFL shield, so you end up looking like the NFL franchise <a href="https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2020/1/19/21073367/rob-lowe-nfl-hat-nfc-championship-packers-49ers" rel="nofollow ">embodiment of Rob Lowe</a>, giving games a strange one-team-versus-the-league aesthetic at a glance. This is easier to read than the possibly very busy illustrations the Team Pass may grant you, but it still replaces a sensible team-specific logo with the default NFL logo as a means of getting you to care about the Team Pass. It's the equivalent of NBA 2K's annual bland, brown shirt for all new create-a-players filtering into the game. It's purposely unappealing to inspire you to spend money on something nicer. But in this case, the nicer option isn't so nice.</p><p dir="ltr">There are bigger problems in the world. Heck, there are even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/">bigger problems in the Madden world</a>. I haven't lost sight of that. But so often, better, more consistent sports sims sweat the small stuff to such an appreciable degree that it's exciting to see what those games will roll out with each new game. In the case of Madden, I have been conditioned to merely hope the game<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/"> doesn't permanently erase my hundreds of hours of Franchise saved data</a> or that I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-24-mercifully-lets-players-turn-off-one-of-the-series-worst-features/1100-6514909/">eventually turn off an unbalanced mechanic</a> that never improved across several iterations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428328"></a><figcaption>To each their own, but even without the scorebug problem, it's hard to rationalize why they felt they needed three Patriot logos on this one profile pic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4428328-58b7f56c-24e0-43cd-a4c8-4c10db3a1b9b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not interested in buying the Team Pass, but I acknowledge that it could be fun and harmless for a portion of the massive community to chase these rewards. Every live-service game has a mandate to be what I like to call "a little more Fortnite." Customization and cosmetic brags like a rare skin or profile picture inspire tons of spending and countless hours played. Maybe Madden will enjoy a similar outcome with its first Team Pass. But in a mode like online Franchise, in which players already painstakingly tweak the game's sliders, rules, and behaviors to cover up some of the inherited blemishes the series drops in our laps, these MUT-like touches just get in the way of what is often already a head-scratching experience.</p><p dir="ltr">My hope for this new cosmetic overhaul is that the EA Orlando team will find another place for us to show off our player banners--a non-obstructive, non-headache-inducing place. Additional revenue streams are unavoidable in many games today, especially those operating like a live service such as Madden, so I get that this stuff is here to stay, but does it have to stay in my way?</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is celebrating 100 million mod downloads by giving the game's undead hero Withers some big naturals. The developer has added the <a href="https://mod.io/g/baldursgate3/m/withersbignaturals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Withers Big Naturals" mod</a> by creator MaybeeAdam to its official mod list, meaning console players can give their Withers a set of big boobs, if they feel so inclined. The mod is a reference to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/guides/what-in-gods-name-is-gandalf-big-naturals-the-surreal-photoshop-lotr-meme-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Gandalf Big Naturals" meme </a>that originated on Tumblr in 2021.</p><p>Larian announced the addition, and the number of mod downloads, with a social media post featuring a picture of Withers with the text "100 million mod downloads." Both the zeros in 100 million have been photoshopped over Withers' chest. The post is captioned, "you are modding naturals."</p><p>In October 2024, Larian announced players had downloaded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/" data-ref-id="1100-6527513">50 million mods</a>. 100,000 of those downloads were to rename Withers to "Bone Daddy." That was just over two months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes/2900-5753/" data-ref-id="2900-5753"> a patch added official mod support</a> to the game on PC and console.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Baldur's Gate 3's final big patch</a> will bring 12 new subclasses, cross-play, and a photo mode. You can<a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> register to preview the patch in a stress test</a>. Larian is already focusing on a mysterious new project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.

                <p>Esteemed Polish development studio CD Projekt Red has a number of projects in development, including a remake of the 2007 original The Witcher game. It appears to still be relatively early days for the game, but there are already some key details to know. In this post, we're rounding up everything you need to know.</p><p>In addition to The Witcher remake, CD Projekt is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel,</a> a new Witcher game codenamed Project Sirius, and a new IP codenamed Project Hadar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260" data-ratio="0.55088495575221" data-width="904" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260"></a><figcaption>The Witcher is getting a remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_">When will The Witcher remake be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_"><strong>When will The Witcher remake be released?</strong></h2><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced The Witcher remake in October 2022</a>, and there is no word on a release date as of yet.</p><h2 id="Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</h2><p>Preorders for The Witcher remake are not open yet, but it can be assumed that players will be able to eventually order the game from CD Projekt's own GOG store in addition to a variety of other destinations.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, CD Projekt has not released any official trailers for The Witcher remake.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</h2><p>CD Projekt has not announced any platforms for The Witcher remake, but PC seems to be a given, while it is expected the game will also come to console platforms.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Witcher remake is a new version of the game "rebuilt from the ground up." CD Projekt Red boss Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience" feels "just as big, if not bigger" than when the studio first released the original game in 2007.</p><p>The game is based on Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, taking place in a medieval fantasy world and telling the story of the monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia and his travels throughout a dangerous world filled with human and fantastical enemies alike. It's expected the remake will tell the same story.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</h2><p>The Witcher remake is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which is the newest version of the engine. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4.</a> Previously, The Witcher series was developed using CD Projekt's own RedEngine.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</h2><p>CD Projekt created The Witcher series, but the studio handed off development to Fool's Theory for the remake. CD Projekt boss Adam Badowski sung the studio's praises, saying the team knows the source material well and understand that fans have been looking forward to a remake for some time. A number of Fool's Theory staffers previously worked at CD Projekt on the original Witcher game. CD Projekt Red is providing "full creative supervision."</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</h2><p>A key difference between the original Witcher and the remake is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-fully-open-world-unlike-the-original/1100-6509525/" data-ref-id="1100-6509525">the remake will be fully open-world</a>. Not only was the first Witcher game presented in a more linear fashion, the sequel, Assassins of Kings, was as well. These games featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. The series didn't go fully open world until 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>According to Jakub Rokosz, who heads up the remake's developer, Fool's Theory, parts of The Witcher that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-remove-simply-bad-and-outdated-elements/1100-6520729/" data-ref-id="1100-6520729">outdated or are "simply bad" will be removed.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-remake-dev-pledges-to-remove-the-parts-that-are-simply-bad-and-i-think-i-know-whats-first-on-the-chopping-block/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Rokosz said that "first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade," but these changes will be done while "highlighting the parts that are great, should be retained, or are direct key pillars that can't be discarded" for the remake.</p><p>Some fans have already begun predicting which elements will be sent to the chopping block. Obvious changes include the dated combat and traversal systems, while online, fans are speculating that Geralt's infamous "Romance Cards" won't be included in the remake either.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/">imminent horizon</a>, Nintendo finds itself at a critical juncture. Every console launch is a pivotal moment for a company, but that's especially true for Nintendo. The first Switch proved to be a remarkable rebound from the disastrous Wii U, becoming one of the best-selling video game consoles in history over the last eight years.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nintendo is undoubtedly facing a lot of pressure to maintain this momentum with its next console. And while it's tempting to compare this transition with the move from Wii to Wii U, the company's current situation more closely resembles the position it was in as it prepared to launch the 3DS--itself the successor to a hugely successful and influential system.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, 14 years ago this week, Nintendo hosted a media event in New York detailing its launch plans for the 3DS. Though the company had publicly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gut-reactions-nintendo-3ds-e3-2010/1100-6266572/">unveiled the handheld a few months prior at E3 2010</a>, it withheld some key details--including the system's release date, price, and launch lineup--until this January event. In hindsight, however, the reveal offered a glimpse at a rough road ahead for the platform--missteps that Nintendo will want to avoid repeating when it finally launches the Switch 2.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Meager Launch Lineup</h3><p dir="ltr">The first indication of trouble could be gleaned from the system's launch lineup. Although Nintendo had announced some exciting titles for the 3DS at E3--including a remake of the beloved Ocarina of Time, new entries in the Animal Crossing and Mario Kart franchises, and a long-awaited Kid Icarus revival--none of these would be available on day one. In fact, most would not arrive until several months after the system launched.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Nintendo pushed the 3DS out to market alongside a handful of amusing but slight built-in applications like Face Raiders, as well as three minor titles: Nintendogs + Cats, Pilotwings Resort, and submarine sim Steel Diver. Without a marquee first-party release to accompany the system, it fell to third parties to fill in the gap. Their offerings, however, were not much more enticing, with a port of the years-old Street Fighter IV garnering the most attention.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, the handheld struggled to attract an audience right from the outset. As novel as the 3DS hardware itself was, the system hit the market without a true "must-have" game to convince players to upgrade, and many ended up waiting before finally purchasing one--a situation Nintendo will no doubt want to avoid repeating when it's finally ready to launch the Switch 2.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="37255568" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr">Price</h3><p dir="ltr">Another crucial miscalculation on Nintendo's part was the system's price tag. By 2011, the final iteration of the Nintendo DS line, the DSi XL, was on the market for $170. Given the way Nintendo historically priced its handhelds, most industry watchers expected the 3DS to launch in the vicinity of $200. However, the final price would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-3ds-and-historical-handheld-pricing/1100-6286318/">much higher</a>. Nintendo surprised many when it announced the 3DS would retail for $250--$80 more than the DSi XL.</p><p dir="ltr">Without experiencing the 3DS in person, it was difficult for consumers to square the steep price tag. The system's defining feature--glasses-free stereoscopic 3D effects--could not be adequately conveyed to prospective buyers without getting the handheld into their hands and having them witness it for themselves (and even then, the feature’s novelty was arguably not as enticing as Nintendo hoped and would eventually be phased out in later iterations of the platform). Moreover, the early launch games, while a clear step up from the DS in terms of graphical fidelity, were not exactly visual showpieces for the handheld, making it difficult for Nintendo to justify the system's price to consumers.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Missing Features</h3><p dir="ltr">The final warning sign from the press event was the 3DS's features--or lack thereof. Although the system was poised to launch in March, its digital storefront, the Nintendo eShop, would not go live until June 2011: three full months later. Moreover, though Nintendo had touted the system's ability to play 3D movies back at E3, it had no further news to share about this feature during the January press event, which gave the impression the company was rushing the handheld out to market before it was ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Taken together, these three missteps set the 3DS on a rocky path, and the system limped out of the gate when it launched that March. Sales were so worrying that Nintendo took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-slashes-3ds-prices/1100-6325850/">slashing the system's price</a> by an eye-popping $80 USD in July, less than six months into its lifetime. (To further illustrate just how shocking this move was, the Nintendo Switch still has yet to receive an official price cut, nearly eight years into its life.) As a make-good to early adopters who did pony up the original asking price, the company also distributed an unexpectedly generous gift as part of an “<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-more-3ds-ambassador-games-named/1100-6331880/">Ambassador Program</a>”: 20 free NES and Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.</p><p dir="ltr">This drastic course-correction had the intended effect, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/price-cut-saves-3ds-4-million-sold-in-u-s-in-2011/">3DS sales rebounded</a>. By the time Nintendo stopped supporting the platform in 2019, the entire 3DS line had sold almost 76 million units--a respectable amount, but less than half of the 154 million units the original DS line moved. It's difficult to say whether or not the system would have sold much more over its lifetime had it had a smoother launch, but it's clear that early stumbles are difficult to correct, and most platforms never fully recover from a rocky start.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is undoubtedly aware of these pitfalls, having gone through many successful (and not so successful) hardware launches over its long history. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">repeatedly stressed</a> the need to ensure Switch owners can "smoothly transition" to the console's successor, citing the Nintendo Account system as an integral component of this strategy. Like the 3DS, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/">Switch 2 will also be backwards compatible</a> with its predecessor. Nintendo has already confirmed the new system will play original Switch games, guaranteeing it has a deep library right from the outset (especially with major Switch 1 titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> still on the way later this year).</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the similar circumstances it finds itself in, Nintendo is in a better position than it was when the 3DS launched. For one, every public statement indicates Nintendo will treat the Switch 2 as a continuation rather than a fresh start, as it has traditionally done when launching a new platform. To date, every system Nintendo has released has featured a distinct online service and storefront, which meant the company was continually starting from scratch each generation. The Wii stands as a prime example: Although it gradually built up an impressive selection of retro Virtual Console games over its lifetime, once the Wii U launched, Nintendo had to wipe the slate clean and release the games--at its typical glacial pace--all over again on the Wii U eShop.</p><p dir="ltr">That will not be the case moving forward thanks to Nintendo Switch Online, which Furukawa confirmed will also be available on Switch 2. Over the past seven years, the subscription service has amassed a vast collection of legacy games between its base and Expansion Pack tiers, so out of the gate Switch 2 users will have access to a wealth of classics--and a continued reason to subscribe to the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Time will tell how the Switch 2 will ultimately fare whenever it finally launches, but these are promising signs that Nintendo is taking the lessons of its past failures seriously and is doing its best to avoid repeating the mistakes that have hampered its previous consoles.</p>

                <p>Nearly nine years ago, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-new-switch-games-confirmed-after-nintend/1100-6457551/" data-ref-id="1100-6457551">Crashlands</a> introduced players to an alien space trucker named Flux Dabes as she survived a crash landing on the planet Woanope and crafted her way out of that jam. Flux's history will repeat itself this spring when Crashlands 2 arrives. In the new trailer below, Flux is literally dropped on to Woanope again as she is forced to make a new life for herself until she can get off-world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7fzLf59vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ib7fzLf59vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, Flux has to start over from scratch. That means if she wants a home, she'll have to build one herself. As before, Flux can craft her own objects and buildings, and she can also create weapons, traps, and any kind of gadget she needs to survive on Woaope. But on this world, Flux isn't necessarily on top of the food chain, and the alien creatures often hunt each other.</p><p>The announcement for the game also hints that Flux will uncover multiple mysteries on Woanope, and she'll be making some new friends to help her solve them. An ancient warrior named Grandmammy is among her new allies, in addition to Kleewik, an inventor who can employ Flux as a lab technician. Beyond mere escape, Flux's goal is to unite the various factions of Woanope, and "restore balance to the planet."</p><p>"Since the moment we launched the original Crashlands, we've been wanting to come back for round 2," Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster said in a statement. "But we wanted it to be bigger and better in every way, and it's taken many years to be able to pull that off. We can't wait to see newcomers experience the world of Woanope for the first time, and for players of the original to reconnect with Flux. So many people have told us that the original Crashlands was an important part of their childhood, and now we get to bring them a Crashlands 2 that's grown up as much as they have!"</p><p>Crashlands 2 will launch on PC, iOS, and Android on April 10, and players will be able to use cross-platform saves. The game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>
