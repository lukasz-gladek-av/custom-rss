                <p>Last summer, SAG-AFTRA called for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">a voice actors strike against video game publishers</a> over numerous issues including AI protections. Although the union has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/voice-actors-union-has-signed-deals-with-80-individual-games-as-strike-continues/1100-6526318/" data-ref-id="1100-6526318">reached deals with a handful of publishers</a>, the strike is still ongoing. Now, Bungie has confirmed that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-arc-abilities-revealed-for-episode-heresy/1100-6528871/" data-ref-id="1100-6528871">Destiny 2: Heresy</a> expansion will include scenes that are missing spoken dialogue because a deal with the actors has yet to be reached.</p><p>In an update on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid-01-30-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie's official site</a>, the developer noted that "certain voice lines" were not recorded because of the actors strike. In those scenes, Destiny 2 will enable subtitles by default in order to carry the narrative forward despite the missing audio. The update also notes that any Heresy activities that are missing voice overs will feature an on-screen warning before starting. However, the update doesn't address whether those lines will be recorded when the strike ends.</p><p>Over on Bluesky, a voice actor going by Orchid shared their response to the news by reiterating the actors' desire to "get a fair deal" that addresses their AI concerns.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:4a6bsmiblgk53rgasz7hg4nv/app.bsky.feed.post/3lgygwqjalk2j" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreib44zbyxqjaswhdqm5d7uym2sjmhzobqaol5swylcjdigpe7gt6n4"><div><p>For everyone complaining: we‚Äôre still on strike. We would like to work, but until we get a fair deal, our concerns regarding AI addressed, etc, we will not.
