                <p>The world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is about to get bigger again with the upcoming expansion pack Adventure Awaits. And while tropical getaways and summer camp experiences are the focus of this pack, it's also bringing back imaginary friends from The Sims 3. You can see one of the imaginary friends in the first trailer for Adventure Awaits, as well as an extended glimpse at your Sims vacation options.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aS0NxrRJm6I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aS0NxrRJm6I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Adventure Awaits doesn't just cater to adult sims. Child sims are also given the chance to have formative moments as they discover archery, diving, papercraft, and other camp activities. As for the imaginary friends, they will appear as four different dolls with a handful of personality types: Goofball, creative, competitive, and evil. Picking the evil option seems unnecessarily risky, but it's your Sim life and you get to make all of the bad decisions you want.</p><p>There are three Gibbi Point vacation neighborhoods included in this pack, including Camp Gibbi Gibbi in the Wanderwood Wilds. There are so many camp activities for children and adult sims that the only thing it's missing is Jason Voorhees to menace the camp attendees. The other neighborhoods in the pack are Crystal Valley and Jellyfish Junction.</p><p>Each neighborhood has its own exclusive activities, and adult sims can take up everything from kayaking to fishing for jellyfish. Players also have the option of turning their sims into park workers as either camp counselors or park rangers. If none of those vacation getaways appeal to you, players can build their own custom resorts. EA has also teamed up with Sims custom creators Jeyjeybink, daniellebuilds, Gryphi, KiwiSimsKate, and Axiisims, all of whom created their own unique experiences for fans to sample.</p><p>A gameplay trailer for The Sims 4 Adventure Awaits will debut on September 10. The expansion itself will follow on October 2 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is the GTA6 of the indie games world. It's the megaton game that every other game wants to dodge. But sometimes publishers just can't change their release dates. We put together a list of some of the other games releasing today to check out if Silksong isn't your jam (or you just like being contrarian), as well as a few of the anticipated games that scooted out of the way of Hornet and her deadly needle.</p><h2>Games Releasing September 4, 2025</h2><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/adventure-of-samsara/" data-ref-id="5000-513724"><strong>Adventure of Samsara</strong></a> - Notably, Adventure of Samsara is a search-action (colloquially known as a Metroidvania) game, just like Hollow Knight, and you're also a little guy with a sword. This game features some great-looking pixel art.</p><p><strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> "The Order of the Giants" DLC</strong> - This expansion delves deeper into the "Order of Giants" hinted at in the base game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562290"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562290-hellisus.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538"><strong>Hell is Us</strong></a> - In a place ravaged by war and a mysterious calamity, you search for answers about your own past. This game is a third-person action game with souls-like elements.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486"><strong>NBA 2K26</strong></a> - If there's anyone that isn't worried about Silksong affecting their sales, its probably 2K Games and their latest NBA game. There just isn't as much overlap with basketball as there is with a game like The Adventures of Samsara or a souls-inspired game like Hell is Us.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289" data-ratio="0.56166666666667" data-width="600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562289"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4562289-jetrunner.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jetrunner/" data-ref-id="5000-625135"><strong>Jetrunner</strong></a> - A stylish first-person parkour game with flashy, cel-shaded visuals.</p><p>Other games releasing today include the Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars: Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everybodys-golf-hot-shots/" data-ref-id="5000-670014">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>, and the Apple Arcade exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nfl-retro-bowl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-690212">NFL Retro Bowl '26</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, a bunch of other games made a run for it once Silksong claimed that September 4 date. The sci-fi roguelite FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/moros-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-563235">Moros Protocol</a> jumped to September 18, as did the PlayStation 1-aesthetic roguelike survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/megabonk/" data-ref-id="5000-656106">Megabonk</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/" data-ref-id="5000-590662">Baby Steps</a>, the follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/getting-over-it-with-bennett-foddy/" data-ref-id="5000-473119">Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</a>, awkwardly planted one foot in front of the other toward a September 23 release date. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demonschool/" data-ref-id="5000-566115">Demonschool</a> was set to release September 23, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ysbryd.net/post/3lxajaaptg22t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer Ysbird said of the delay</a>, "We have to remind ourselves that gaining visibility for Demonschool is our main goal. Thus, the Ysbryd team strongly believes we would not be doing our game any favors by wading into waters we can clearly see are blood red."</p><p>Meanwhile, Hollow Knight: Silksong has landed with extremely positive word of mouth. It also almost immediately started <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashing the servers</a> for Steam and the Nintendo eShop, and affecting service on Game Pass. Hollow Knight: Silksong peaked on Steam with 535,000 players, putting it in the top three for concurrent players alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike-2/" data-ref-id="5000-595646">Counter-Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dota-2/" data-ref-id="5000-87436">Dota 2</a>.</p>
