The title is a remake of the 2008 Nintendo DS game Harvest Moon: Grand Bazaar. The Story of Seasons remake launches for Nintendo Switch on August 27, 2025. Previous Story of Season remakes, including Friends of Mineral Town, launched on PC and other platforms, though Marvelous didn't say whether Grand Bazaar will as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar drops you in a run-down town whose glory days as a center of commerce are long gone. Rather than just running a farm and becoming the center of village life, your goal in Grand Bazaar is revitalizing the marketplace by selling the best items you produce and contributing to everyone else's success as well. The Grand Bazaar remake trailer showcased a visual overhaul--the original 2.5D is replaced with full, detailed 3D models--and sound clips, along with a new way to travel around the valley via a wind glider. Marvelous also said the remake will feature new characters and new events.</p><p dir="ltr">Other remakes, including Friends of Mineral Town, tweaked relationship systems to be more inclusive and added quality-of-life improvements as well, though Marvelous didn't outline other improvements in the reveal.</p>

The rhythm-game series hasn't seen a new title since 2015's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rhythm-heaven-megamix/" data-ref-id="5000-387128">Rhythm Heaven Megamix</a>, but fans of the musical franchise will be waiting a little while longer, since Rhythm Heaven Groove isn't being released until 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4466443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4466443"></a><figcaption>A skipping game in Rhythm Heaven Groove</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466443-nintendodirect3.27.2025%E2%80%93nintendoswitch53-43screenshot.png"></figure><p>In Rhythm Heaven games, players complete minigames with rhythm mechanics where the gameplay focuses on audio rather than visual cues. Following the rhythm through the level, you're given a score based on your accuracy. Usually, the games are grouped into four or six minigames comprising of predominantly main stages and concluding with a remix. The remix is a compilation or twist on the last few games in the set, all compiled into one level with a different song. In later games, the remixes would feature levels from former Rhythm Games titles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466442" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466442"></a><figcaption>Rhythm Heaven Groove title screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4466442-rhythm-heaven-groove.jpg"></figure><p>Depending on your rhythm and accuracy, the game will rank you one of three titles. Being told to "Try Again" is a failure and demands a repeat of the level. Getting a "Try Again" rank three times in a row usually triggers the option to skip the stage. The "OK" rank is a pass, but only just. The "Superb" rank is reserved for players who have excelled at the stage, and will earn a medal. The medals can be used to unlock additional game modes, including endless games, and makes players eligible to participate in randomly selected Perfect Campaigns, where missing even one beat will cause the level to fail and restart. With only three chances to complete a Perfect Campaign, it's the highest-pressure version of Rhythm Heaven on offer.</p><p>The Rhythm Heaven series began on the Game Boy Advance in 2006 and has been predominantly released on Nintendo consoles since, including the Nintendo DS, 3DS, and Wii. Rhythm Heaven Groove, as the fifth entry in the series, will be the first Rhythm Heaven game to be released on a Switch console.

                <p>During today's Switch-focused Nintendo Direct livestream, Nintendo revealed a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The trailer was a narrated deep dive with lots of gameplay detailing the new game. The game is still slated for 2025, but no new release date was given.</p><p>The trailer showed Samus exploring a jungle planet with a colossal tree at the center. She has to scan stone figures to make her way through the thick forest while dealing with hostile bug-like aliens. But she'll be helped along by new Psychic abilities, like telekinesis for puzzle-solving and making her way through doors. It seems as if some psychic force is helping her along, and at one point it calls her a "Chosen One." The trailer ends with a brief look at a slick new red and white suit.</p>

<p>The wait for Metroid Prime 4 has been excruciating for fans of the franchise. The game was first announced during E3 2017, but there was a prolonged period of radio silence after that initial announcement. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">Development on the game was reportedly rebooted in 2019</a>, and Nintendo went silent for several years on the status of the next Metroid Prime adventure, filling the gap with Metroid Dread in 2021 and a remaster of the first Metroid Prime game in 2023.</p><p>2024 also saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/">trailer for Metroid Prime 4</a> released, but it was light on details at the time.
