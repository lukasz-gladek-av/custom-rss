                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-and-galaxy-2-are-still-peak-3d-platforming/1100-6535097/" data-ref-id="1100-6535097">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> finally made their way to the Switch, and they've never looked better. Before now, you could only play them on the old Wii or through the limited-time Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Switch--which didn't even include Galaxy 2. Now, both games are available on the regular Switch and Switch 2.</p><p>There are a lot of things to appreciate with the new remasters, and Digital Foundry took a deep dive into the biggest differences and the mild downgrades. The biggest difference is that the original Switch runs the games at up to 1080p, while the Switch 2 boosts the visuals all the way to 4K resolution, making everything look much sharper and cleaner, especially on modern TVs. You can check out the full breakdown below. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWUbpoFO6-Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Basically, most of the menus, cutscenes, and controls are the same as the 2020 3D All-Stars version, including things like touchscreen and motion controls. The pre-rendered cutscenes still run at 1080p, even on Switch 2, and haven't been upgraded to 4K. That's a bit of a letdown, especially since those scenes also show some compression issues and color problems. Still, the improved resolution and sharper gameplay visuals on Switch 2 do a lot to make up for it. Shadows now show from farther away, and character models look better at a distance, too.</p><p>Another huge improvement are the new high-resolution textures. Nintendo updated nearly every surface in the game--grass, dirt, rocks, bricks, and even character clothing. These textures look much clearer and more detailed than on the original Wii. For example, Mario's overalls now have visible stitching, and Peach's eyes and eyelashes are more detailed. Some areas, like the hay in the Dino Piranha's nest and the brick paths in Honeyhive Galaxy, show big upgrades while still keeping the original design.</p><p>There are a few small downsides. The cutscene videos still look a bit compressed, and color banding can sometimes be seen in skies or backgrounds. But overall, these new versions of Galaxy 1 and 2 look better than ever. The Switch 2 version especially benefits from the higher resolution and cleaner textures, though even the regular Switch version is a nice improvement over the old Wii release. While not a full remake, this remaster does a great job of polishing up two of Nintendo's best platformers for a new generation.</p>

In the blog post, the studio said the focus was to create "greater build diversity by adjusting underperforming skills." This includes tweaks like buffing the Forgeknight Amon in general so he's as strong as the other Vault Hunters, increasing the Exo-Soldier Rafa's summons and the Siren Vex's melee power to make those builds better in the endgame, and adjusting the Gravitar Harlowe's Stasis ability to ensure it's "getting value" for you.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>While sending the Vault Hunters to the gym for strength training is the main highlight of this new update, Gearbox Software also made some other changes to the looter-shooter. This includes buffing the weekly Big Encore boss, moving Maurice’s Black Market Vending Machine and altering its available offerings, and adding an auto-clearing of Borderlands 4's stale shaders to prevent performance degradation on some PCs.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launched on September 12 to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a favorable critical reception</a>. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">our Borderlands 4 review</a>, critic Jordan Ramee awarded the game a 7/10, saying, "All in all, if uncovering loot, crafting builds, and unleashing chaotic mayhem is what you're looking for, Borderlands 4 has you covered." While currently available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a> is coming--though it was delayed indefinitely--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gets-new-vault-hunter-in-early-2026/1100-6535088/" data-ref-id="1100-6535088">a new Vault Hunter joins the looter-shooter</a>'s roster in 2026.</p><p>With all of that said, you can check out the full patch notes for Borderlands 4's October 2 update down below:</p><h2>Change List</h2><h3>Weekly Activities:</h3><ul><li>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</li><li>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

                <p>The Halo TV series didn't work out and was canceled after two seasons, but if you're curious and have a Netflix subscription, you're in luck. Both seasons of the sci-fi series are out now on Netflix.</p><p>The debut of the Halo series on Netflix seems to be proving popular, as the show has reached No. 4 on the most-popular TV show chart in the US today, October 2. The Top 10 list is ranked by views, and you can read more about <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/top-10-things-about-Netflix-top-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how the data is calculated on Netflix's blog.</a></p><p>Season 1 had nine episodes, with Season 2 delivering eight, for a total of 17. The show stars Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief, Natascha McElhone as Halsey, and Jen Taylor as Cortana.</p><p>Hollywood icon Steven Spielberg was an executive producer on the TV series with his production company, Amblin.

The film that rose from its ashes was the well-received sci-fi movie District 9.</p><p>As for the Halo game series, Microsoft just announced that it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/news-on-halos-future-is-coming-very-soon/1100-6535104/" data-ref-id="1100-6535104">reveal what's coming next on October 24</a>, so keep checking with GameSpot for more.</p>
