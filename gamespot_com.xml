                <p dir="ltr">The Nightlord will apparently pluck foes from the past to stop players in Elden Ring: Nightreign. Game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that Dark Souls enemies will show up in the upcoming co-op action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Ishizaki noted that a handful of Dark Souls adversaries will appear in Elden Ring: Nightreign during <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Famitsu interview</a>. This comes after fans believed they saw The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3 featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-for-2025-co-op-action-spin-off/1100-6528435/" data-ref-id="1100-6528435">the co-op survival game's debut trailer at The Game Awards</a> last week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djtsw5k_DNc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?start=6" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Ishizaki recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-isnt-a-live-service-game-and-wont-be-full-priced/1100-6528462/" data-ref-id="1100-6528462">Elden Ring: Nightreign isn't a live-service game</a>, even though it features multiplayer-centric survival features. Bandai Namco added that it will be priced similarly to the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, which launched with a $40 price tag.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wont-have-cross-play/1100-6528467/" data-ref-id="1100-6528467">Elden Ring: Nightreign also won't have cross-play</a>. There is the ability to play between console generations--PS4 owners with PS5 players, for example--but not across different platforms. From Software will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">a network test for the action-RPG in February 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaning into roguelike mechanics, Elden Ring: Nightreign will see players starting a three-day-and-night cycle to ultimately take down the Nightlord. From Software wants each run to be unique, though relics can be carried over with future attempts in Limveld. The co-op game, which can be played solo, is set to release next year.</p>

                <p>Talk to most collectors and they'll tell you that the pandemic almost five years ago changed the way people buy and sell collectibles. Pokemon cards were heavily affected and some big chain retailers like Target had to limit the number of packs they could sell to customers. They've become such a hot commodity that Japan's news media has reported that the mob is using cards to assist in laundering money.</p><p>As Shunkan Gendai online reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/nongaming-news/pokemon-cards-are-so-valuable-that-criminals-are-using-them-to-launder-dirty-money-japanese-media-reports/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), criminals have been turning their dirty money into Pokemon cards. The cards' portable size makes them easy to hide and transport, and then they resell the cards, converting their profits into local currency.</p><p>"Many criminals who commit bank transfer fraud are converting the money they steal into Pokemon cards. Shady money can't be deposited in a bank, and there's a high risk of it being stolen if you hold it in cash," a former high ranked crime family member explained. "Pokemon cards are easy to hide, and if you take them overseas and cash them there, you can't get tracked down."</p><p>Criminals have also gotten smarter with what to look out for and feel for when trying to get the more valuable cards. With the chances of getting sought-after Pokemon-ex cards rare already, criminals are now using metal detectors to get a hit on the foil from the card. They're also implementing highly sensitive weighing devices to determine if an unopened pack contains a rare foil card.</p><p>In 2022, YouTuber and WWE performer Logan Paul bought a graded Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.7 million, making it the most expensive card ever sold. The Pikachu Illustrator was only awarded to the winners of the Original Illustration Contest in Japan, with only 20-39 known copies ever released. Similarly graded cards are priced on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eBay for $2-$4 million</a>.</p>

                <p>Developer Turque Games has announced that Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance will be shutting down its servers on February 24, 2025, and will be delisted from digital storefronts.</p><p>The base game and all DLC will still be playable offline in single-player mode. The game's singular DLC expansion is called Echoes of the Blood War, which adds one new playable character named Auralla--a Tiefling warlock who focuses on spell-casting and crowd control.</p><p>There are also two new challenge dungeons in the DLC, with six level in total. The first one is the Abandoned Mines, where players investigate a cultist experiment on trolls in a duergar mine. The second is called Spawn of Yeenoghu, where players travel to the Hinterlands to stop a faction of Gnolls from summoning their demon lord.</p><p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance is an action-RPG with a focus on dynamic co-op gameplay. The game was first released in 2021 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. It was also added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-dark-alliance-will-launch-on-xbox-game-pass-on-day-one/1100-6491453/" data-ref-id="1100-6491453">Xbox Game Pass on launch day</a>.</p><p>While Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance shares a similar name to Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and Dark Alliance II, its gameplay and story are unrelated to them. On Gamespot's sister site, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dungeons-and-dragons-dark-alliance/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance received mostly unfavorable reviews, sitting at an average score of 53.</p>
