                <p dir="ltr">The Nintendo internet sleuths are at it again! In late May, Nintendo released a brief video detailing some of the new features coming to Nintendo Switch Online's Nintendo 64 offerings--which included a CRT filter, rewind feature, and more. However, that video may have contained more news than it seems, and a group of intrepid Internet users think they've cracked the code--and revealed a few new games that may be on their way to the NSO N64 service.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-analysing-blurry-pixels-believe-nintendo-switch-online-is-getting-super-smash-bros-for-its-n64-catalogue-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-more" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, a group of fans led by <a href="https://x.com/ImakuniVT/status/1941912231303585925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1942026877318680791%7Ctwgr%5E81d8ab37837193df03a8a23f05f1da4299bbc04a%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Ffans-analysing-blurry-pixels-believe-nintendo-switch-online-is-getting-super-smash-bros-for-its-n64-catalogue" rel="nofollow ">vtuber Imakuni</a> have analyzed the blurry cover-art images shown at the 40-second mark in the video below. By enhancing those blurred images and comparing them to images of Nintendo 64 cover art, the group thinks they've unearthed five N64 games that aren't on the Nintendo Switch Online service yet--but could be coming soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDNg1pwrTVg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wDNg1pwrTVg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The five games the group thinks they've discovered are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Donkey Kong 64</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken 64</li><li dir="ltr">Glover</li><li dir="ltr">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</li><li dir="ltr">Super Smash Bros.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">A subsequent post by <a href="https://x.com/Betonoguau/status/1942026877318680791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X user Betonoguau</a> shows the group's potential discovery in video form, with a clip of the official Nintendo video overlaid with the allegedly discovered cover arts.</p><p>The Nintendo 64 section of the Nintendo Switch Online library has only seen two updates in 2025 so far, with Ridge Racer 64 joining the service on January 31 and Killer Instinct Gold arriving on May 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, a new wing of NSO offerings arrived with the Nintendo Switch 2 console on June 5, as GameCube games are available on the new system. Only four GameCube games are currently playable--The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Soulcalibur II, F-Zero GX, and Super Mario Strikers--though Super Mario Sunshine, Chibi-Robo, and more will be coming to the service at a later date.</p>

                <p>After being announced last October, we finally have our first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-rising/news/">Destiny: Rising</a>, as well as a release date. The mobile-exclusive sci-fi RPG shooter set in Bungie's Destiny universe will be released for iOS and Android on August 28, surprising some players who theorized it would be Q1 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>The launch date was announced by Chinese development partner <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20250703/41118_1244957.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NetEase Games</a>, the company behind Marvel Rivals and Diablo Immortal, along with the game's first trailer featuring new gameplay.

The game features include single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes,  Primary and Power Weapons, and the ability to share your loadout across different character arsenals.</p><p>NetEase is also adding a new Mythic-tier rarity for gear, as well as a whole new weapon type. The developer is promising "tons of exciting loot to gather for your characters."</p><p>To get players excited and ready for the game's release, NetEase is holding a <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-registration event</a> where people can unlock special bonuses when the game launches. This event unlocks more rewards with each player milestone, which is currently sitting at five million, with the final incentive at 10 million.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In September 2021, a massive leak at Nvidia revealed multiple then-unannounced projects, and as years have passed since the leak, all but one of the leaked titles associated with Square Enix has been officially confirmed. That one is a remake of Final Fantasy IX, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary today--and Square Enix has commemorated the milestone by fueling those remake rumors with a new anniversary video.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/remake-reports-persist-as-square-enix-releases-final-fantasy-9-anniversary-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the minute-long video--set to the iconic song Melodies of Life from the FFIX soundtrack--runs through key moments from the ninth Final Fantasy adventure, with shots of main characters Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and more peppered throughout. The video ends with new artwork of the team, with the words "Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary" included.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFDDlEaUXxw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video has intensified the rumors of a remake which began with the Nvidia leak, with many wondering if the project is still in development. Prominent leaker NateTheHate, in a <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1942164160365703368" rel="nofollow ">comment on a ResetEra thread about the video</a>, mentioned that, perhaps, the remake may no longer be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," NateTheHate's <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968" rel="nofollow ">comment reads</a>, "but I need to do a fresh check and see what a more current status is--as I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble and possibly canceled. I only had one source on the cancellation possibility and need to verify the info further."</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has not commented on the rumored project since it was first mentioned in the Nvidia leak. However, of the eight Square Enix games featured in the leak, seven of them have since been announced or released--with the most recent confirmation being<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/"> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> during the PlayStation State Of Play presentation last month.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of eight Square Enix games that came from the Nvidia leak were as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 9 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Kingdom Hearts IV</li><li dir="ltr">"New strategy game" (since revealed as The Diofield Chronicle)</li><li dir="ltr">Tactics Ogre: Reborn</li><li dir="ltr">"Unannounced Card Game 2" (since revealed as Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden)</li></ul>
