                <p>Sony has shared its latest update for investors, and it's largely good news for PlayStation 5. According to Sony, an additional 3.9 million PS5 consoles were sold in the last quarter, bringing its lifetime total to 84.2 million consoles sold since the system launched in 2020. That puts the PS5 into a virtual dead heat with its predecessor, PlayStation 4, at the same point in its life cycle.</p><p>The complete breakdown of Sony's latest fiscal quarter is <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now online</a>, and its sales chart shows the remarkably similar trajectory of the PS4 and PS5 sales. However, Sony noted that it only projects 15 million additional PS5 console sales during its current fiscal year, which runs through March 31, 2025. If so, that would potentially allow PS4 to retain its crown as Sony's second best-selling console, because it sold 17.8 million systems at that point in its life.</p><p>Regardless, Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have a longer lifespan than the traditional seven-year cycle.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988200080101569014" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sony CFO Lin Tao says the PS5 is only in the middle of its lifecycle and they want to expand the lifecycle even further!<br>"Our view is that compared to conventional console lifecycles. Looking at the PS4 lifecycle it seems to be getting longer and longer. Especially the PS4,… <a href="https://t.co/ecrsI3X9xV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/ecrsI3X9xV</a></p>  — Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1988200080101569014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Kantan Games CEO Dr Serkan Toto told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/on-its-5th-birthday-ps5-sales-remain-virtually-neck-and-neck-with-ps4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a> that Sony's success is at least in part due to the struggles of Microsoft's gaming division and the migration of formerly Xbox-exclusive titles to PS5.</p><p>"Life is good if you have a competitor that is not really focusing on hardware anymore and has given up on exclusive games to start selling them on your platform," said Toto. "Sony is now clearly dominating the high fidelity console gaming space, and just watch what happens to their numbers once GTA 6 is out."</p><p>Sony's report also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> has sold 3.3 million copies since its debut just over a month ago. Unfortunately, the latest word from Sony about Bungie and Destiny isn't as good. Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-takes-a-204-million-hit-as-destiny-2-falls-short-of-expectations/1100-6536124/" data-ref-id="1100-6536124">is claiming a loss of $204 million</a> because Destiny 2 didn't reach its sales goals. For now, Sony is hopeful that Destiny 2's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-expansion-is-star-wars-inspired-and-gives-you-a-lightsaber/1100-6531341/" data-ref-id="1100-6531341">Renegades</a>, may revive interest in the shooter when it launches on December 2.</p>
