                <p dir="ltr">Even a decade after its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-isolation/" data-ref-id="5000-232868">Alien: Isolation</a> remains a standout experience.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a monumental example of adaptation in video games, thanks to the fact that developer Creative Assembly was packed with fans of Ridley Scott's 1979 film, Alien, and an incredibly tight, detailed focus on the fidelity of the movie's setting. It also set a bar in horror game design, with the alien operating on a set of reactive artificial intelligence rules that made it terrifyingly unpredictable and unstoppably lethal.</p><p dir="ltr">It also stands apart from other games based on the Alien franchise, which tend to ignore Scott's original film in favor of iterations on Aliens, James Cameron's sequel, which moves away from straight horror to feature more action--and a bunch of well-outfitted, smack-talking Marines. Creative Assembly instead pitched an <em>Alien</em> game, not an <em>Aliens</em> game, one that would focus on making the creature feel like an unstoppable, unknowable predator instead of a horde of animals players would mow down with pulse rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">"The goal was to transport you back to that time and place, that 1970s view of the future, the kind of lo-fi sci-fi aesthetic of that first movie, allowing you to encounter and try and survive against that original alien--where just one alien could be terrifying, which is really different in terms of video games," director Al Hope told me in a recent interview. "The fact that you can play it today and get that experience, get that feeling--as part of the team that made it, that's so rewarding."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2699099-alienisolationdlc_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2699099" data-ratio="0.54895833333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2699099-alienisolationdlc_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2699099"></a><figcaption>Alien: Isolation focused on capturing the horror intrinsic in the original 1979 film, specifically to make the alien terrifying again.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2699099-alienisolationdlc_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alien: Isolation recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary, and rather than fade into obscurity as time marched on and new game releases took attention away, it instead seems to have grown in popularity over the years since its release. Streamers and content creators seem to keep finding the game, and new ports have been released on Nintendo Switch, iOS, and Android. The Switch version also got a fairly expansive physical collector's edition release from Limited Run Games last year--fully nine years after Alien: Isolation first came out.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems that there's not just a fanbase for Alien: Isolation, but a growing demand for it. On the anniversary, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-isolation-2-is-in-early-development-with-original-director-returning/1100-6526951/">Creative Assembly announced it has started work on an Alien: Isolation sequel</a>, with Hope returning as its director.</p><p dir="ltr">"What's really incredible is that it seems to have grown and snowballed over time, over the last decade, as more people have found it and people talk about it," Hope said. "It's still in the conversation around the scariest games and best Alien game, or whatever. One of the really rewarding things is people are still finding it for the first time today, and having a really fantastic experience. And, you know, considering it's a relatively old game now, or could be considered a relatively old game. And, yeah, I think that's just a testament to the fantastic work that the team did, because it was a labor of love. But, yeah, it's just immensely rewarding that people are still playing and talking about it today."</p><p dir="ltr">What makes Alien: Isolation so frightening is how much the game reacts to the player's actions, beginning with the impressive AI running its alien. The creature is designed to seek players out using its senses, and when it can't find you, to search the station in a fairly systematic way. Another AI, an underlying director, will sometimes direct the alien in your direction if you've gone too long without an encounter, or away from you if the tension has been high for a long time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563858-01_1402071153.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2563858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563858-01_1402071153.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2563858"></a><figcaption>Artificial intelligence systems at work in Alien: Isolation provide a sense that the creature is always hunting you, and being careful and aware are the only things that can save your life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563858-01_1402071153.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other systems also work dynamically to increase the tension and fear when things get intense. Sound design is a huge part of what makes Alien: Isolation so effective, and it's full of reactive elements to ratchet up the fear--including ramping up the music as the situation with the alien gets more and more harrowing.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was interesting for us because we had this idea that the creature wasn't going to be choreographed and scripted, which is what typically occurs in this kind of game," Hope explained. "And I seem to remember this kind of penny drop moment where we realized, well, we can't just ask the composers to create a wav file that we'll just hit play on and it will play out, because it will completely disconnect with what's happening. Because the creature and the drama and the action is completely dynamic and unpredictable, we're gonna have to do something completely different, and that felt like, wow, okay, this has a really big impact on everything, and especially the music, because the music needs to be able to support tension, anticipation, action, and we don't know what's going to happen."</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">We kept getting, 'We need more deaths. Everyone's dying all the time. We need more deaths.' Like 90 different death cues."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"So much is going on under the hood with the music, to get on with the mixing of all the ambient sounds and local sounds," he continued. "We're doing some really fun and pretty clever things, where, when the alien is getting close, we might push the music so we have this emotional content that's kind of being more present than what the player's receiving. But, say there's an alarm going on in the room, we'll actually duck that down, so it's almost like we're replicating the player's focus on the alien so everything else doesn't matter. It's doing really quite brilliant, interesting things to really enhance the experience. And so what you're receiving is this constant, ever-fluctuating soundscape that's being remixed in real time."</p><p dir="ltr">In keeping with the heightened demand for Alien: Isolation, the 10th anniversary also saw another long-awaited release: the game's soundtrack. It's now available on streaming services, and a vinyl and cassette edition are available for preorder from <a href="https://www.iam8bit.com/products/alien-isolation-vinyl-soundtrack" rel="nofollow ">iam8bit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4413977-alienisolationsoundtrack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413977" data-ratio="1" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4413977-alienisolationsoundtrack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413977"></a><figcaption>True to the game's analog tech nature, the iam8bit release of Alien: Isolation's soundtrack is available on vinyl or on cassette tape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4413977-alienisolationsoundtrack.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Creating music that could work dynamically with those systems was a challenge unto itself, as composers Joe Henson and Alexis Smith, who together make up English duo The Flight, told me. Alien: Isolation wasn't the duo's first game--they'd previously worked on Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and LittleBigPlanet. But on previous games, the pair was learning how music in games worked. Isolation was the first big game where they were able to do exactly what they wanted, Henson said, and they were drawn to its low-fi, '70s-inspired aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">While Alien: Isolation's approach to music <em>seemed</em> like a complex problem to solve at the time, the pair said, it didn't actually end up being that difficult to write music that could be used dynamically. It mostly required creating different layers of tracks for each level: an exploration layer for when the player wasn't under threat, a more intense layer for when the alien was present but not hunting you, and a "you're about to die" layer, Henson said.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I remember mostly is making this third layer, which was the 'you're about to die' layer, and it's all very well, making a five-minute ambient exploration piece," he explained. "In order for it to be able to go into this 'you're about to die' at any point, we had to make a five-minute 'you're about to die' layer. We were young and green and really wanting to put our mark on the first game we were going to be proud of, so we did these completely bespoke five minutes. We didn't copy bits. We did ups and downs and going with what was happening in the music. And it works really well. But they were exhausting [to write]."</p><p dir="ltr">"And loads of deaths," Smith chimed in, laughing. "We kept getting, 'We need more deaths. Everyone's dying all the time. We need more deaths.' Like 90 different death cues."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563863-06_1402071176.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2563863" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563863-06_1402071176.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2563863"></a><figcaption>Creative Assembly made sure the alien was a formidable opponent--you can never kill it, only drive it away, but your defenses become less effective the more you use them.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/536/5360430/2563863-06_1402071176.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The music in Alien: Isolation is a big way in which the game links to the movie and works to convey its tone. Isolation's music uses portions of composer Jerry Goldsmith's score from the movie, but as The Flight have noted in the past, there's not actually that much music in Alien, period.</p><p dir="ltr">Isolation separates itself by using some elements of Goldsmith's original score, "threading that DNA" of Alien throughout the game, as Hope put it, while also adding its own sound with the use of other period-appropriate instruments, like synthesizers and electronic elements.</p><p dir="ltr">"That was an interesting discovery actually, while we're working on it, where, when we felt we were losing the Alien sound, we could just drop pepper in those--there are such strong sounds, not just motifs, just <em>sounds </em>from Alien from the score, that we could very easily kind of bring in and bring us back," Smith said.</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">We never thought about trying to compromise."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"It's not like a theme song; it doesn't, like, repeat," Henson said, to which Smith added that the memorable musical elements of Alien are more like "little bits" and small musical phrases. Other elements of the score, like clicking sounds and different noises, as well as analog elements from the equipment and instruments used to create those sounds, ended up being very useful in keeping Isolation's soundscape feeling like Alien.</p><p dir="ltr">"We kind of saw them as almost like samples that we could throw in with other stuff," Henson continued. "And because we love that film so much, and we love that score and everything, that's the way we kind of treated it. Not with too much reverence that we wouldn't do anything to it or change anything, but we knew how to--you know, as long as the electronics we were adding, as long as the stuff we were adding was as crusty as the computers on the space station, then we thought it would work."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2589188-alienisolation2_1404833866.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2589188" data-ratio="0.56475" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2589188-alienisolation2_1404833866.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2589188"></a><figcaption>20th Century Fox gave Creative Assembly access to a huge amount of archival information from Alien, which the studio used to faithfully recreate the look and sound of the film.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2589188-alienisolation2_1404833866.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Getting that soundtrack released "has been an epic struggle," Hope said. A version has been ready to go for the last 10 years--Henson and Smith created a listening version akin to a film score back when Alien: Isolation was in production--but the complex web of stakeholders, copyright holders, and contracts held it back.</p><p dir="ltr">The situation around game soundtracks has changed during that period as well, Smith said. The business of selling game soundtracks has grown significantly, which increased the incentives to finally make Isolation's available.</p><p dir="ltr">For The Flight, the release is a big one. Of all the games they've worked on, Smith said, Alien: Isolation is the one the duo gets asked about most often.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got a 1 million sales thing here [for Alien: Isolation]," Henson said. "I don't know what the sales have got to, but it doesn't touch some of the games we've done. But for fan adoration and respect, from our peers, as well, it's the one."</p><p dir="ltr">"The big thing about this game is, this kind of launched us," Smith said. "So it's a really special soundtrack for us. I still go back and play the game with people I know. I've just actually given it to a friend of mine whose kids have just got into Alien. They're like 18, 19, and one of my friend's kids is absolutely obsessed with it. And now the calls I've been getting are brilliant. The whole family are terrified."</p><p dir="ltr">"I finally played the game with my eldest son last year, but he couldn't. He wouldn't," Henson added. "He plays games all the time. He wouldn't play it on his own. He refused to play on his own when it was dark, because I turn out all the lights. He was shit scared. I feel like there are a lot of people like that."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2423662-0004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2423662" data-ratio="0.56475" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2423662-0004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2423662"></a><figcaption>The intense attention to detail in visuals and sound makes Alien: Isolation one of the best film adaptations ever in video games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1197/11970954/2423662-0004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Replaying Alien: Isolation today, it absolutely holds up--the game is still as unpredictable and frightening as it was in 2014. But while it seems to continue to find its audience, there was a point at release that it seemed to struggle. Review aggregator Metacritic puts Alien: Isolation at an average score of 79, but there are scores that run the gamut, from several 10 out of 10s and 9 out of 10s, to a few that fall significantly lower. At the time, GameSpot gave Alien: Isolation a 6.5 out of 10. IGN reviewed it at a 6 out of 10. Reviewers lauded the game's fidelity in bringing players into its world, but some struggled with the difficulty and dealing with the alien itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Hope if, looking back, there was anything he wished he and the team had done differently. His answer was short: "Ultimately, on balance, no."</p><blockquote data-size="medium" data-align="right"><p dir="ltr">I finally played the game with my eldest son last year, but he couldn't. He wouldn't. He was shit scared. I feel like there are a lot of people like that."</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">"I think we knew, by its nature, we weren't trying to please everybody, you know?" he said. "Some players might think it's too hard. So do we then make it much easier? But then the people who want something more of a challenge will be disappointed. So that's not even really a discussion we had, because we wanted to create this Alien experience which presented a certain level of intrinsic challenge if we were going to take it the approach that we did. ...We never thought about trying to compromise."</p><p dir="ltr">The uncompromising vision was, ultimately, the correct call. It didn't happen all at once, but Alien: Isolation has left its mark both on the extended Alien universe and on the horror game landscape at large. Fede Alvarez, the director of the newest Alien movie, Alien: Romulus, has cited Isolation as an inspiration for the kind of horror he wanted to conjure up with the movie, and he even included the <a href="https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=27c6b2fb3ffa3b0bac2c0e649fbf149cb95e9e320d2907667ef3c3ad2b6448a6JmltdHM9MTczMzcwMjQwMA&amp;ptn=3&amp;ver=2&amp;hsh=4&amp;fclid=05d40eb0-41a0-65da-0c4b-1d16404e64d2&amp;psq=alien+romulus+alien+isolation+influence+gamespot.com&amp;u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2FtZXNwb3QuY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2FsaWVuLXJvbXVsdXMtaW5jbHVkZXMtYW4tZWFzdGVyLWVnZy1mb3ItdGhpcy1wb3B1bGFyLXZpZGVvLWdhbWUvMTEwMC02NTI1NzUwLw&amp;ntb=1">iconic emergency phone save points from Isolation</a> as Easter eggs in the film. Amanda Ripley, Isolation's protagonist, has also become a recurring character in ongoing Alien comics and other media.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2677748-alienisolation_ai_launch_screen004_1411636900_result.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2677748" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2677748-alienisolation_ai_launch_screen004_1411636900_result.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-2677748"></a><figcaption>The story of Alien: Isolation has continued to influence other Alien media, with Amanda Ripley showing up in more stories in the wider canon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1365/13658182/2677748-alienisolation_ai_launch_screen004_1411636900_result.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other horror developers have started to take pages from Creative Assembly's approach to its creature, too, leading to some terrifying new experiences. Games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/amnesia-the-bunker/" data-ref-id="5000-577134">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> feel like different riffs on the idea, putting players in the same kinds of tense situations with unpredictable, unkillable antagonists.</p><p dir="ltr">The Switch and mobile ports, the collector's edition, and the soundtrack release all suggest a demand for Alien: Isolation that's been building, not receding. That goes for the sequel, too--Hope wouldn't talk about it, but said a continual call of a sequel is something Creative Assembly has received every day since the game's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Hope said he and the Alien: Isolation team are "immensely proud" of what they achieved with the game.</p><p>"The team did what we set out to achieve, which was to create that authentic experience that felt like it had never been available before--and we were just <em>desperate </em>to experience that and play it ourselves," he said. "Ten years later, people are still picking up, for the first time, having an amazing experience and talking about wanting more. So, you know, we're really fortunate for the people out there. They've really connected with what we did."</p>

As detailed in a forum <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3616595" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Grinding Gear Games said it is now dealing with an "enormous" amount of support tickets from players that are taking much longer to process than usual. Whereas the developer's support team would usually respond within the same day, or sometimes even within the same hour, it currently can't keep up.</p><p dir="ltr">Technical limitations have compounded the situation, Grinding Gear Games said. Its support system was overloaded with requests, causing emails to not be processed correctly.</p><p dir="ltr">The good news is Grinding Gear Games is looking to hire more people for its support team to "decrease the backlog as soon as possible." It also improved its support systems so that it can process more emails. The developer is urging players who are currently waiting to have their tickets answered to not send follow up requests, as doing so can just create more problems and delays.</p><p dir="ltr">"Please be assured if you're waiting for a response from our Support team, they'll get back to you as soon as humanly possible," Grinding Gear Games said.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding Gear Games is already making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-devs-promise-to-make-game-more-rewarding-with-new-update/1100-6528338/" data-ref-id="1100-6528338">changes to Path of Exile 2 to make it a little less punishing and more rewarding</a>. Players should be body-blocked by monsters less thanks to changes to the game's dodge-roll, and the added ability to teleport between saved checkpoints on a map means players will have to do less backtracking after dying. Rewards from Path of Exile 2's magic, rare, and boss enemies will also be more lucrative, with higher item drop rates.</p><p dir="ltr">For those diving into the punishing world of Wraeclast, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-guides-hub/1100-6528305/" data-ref-id="1100-6528305">Path of Exile 2 guides hub</a> on how to survive and progress your character in the challenging ARPG.</p>

                                        <p>Though Metaphor: ReFantazio is the former Persona team's first foray into high fantasy, it might also be the most grounded and deeply human game they've ever created. By weaving magical elements with universal topics--such as prejudice, poverty, grief, cycles of violence, anxiety, and the role religion and politics can play in both oppressing and empowering the people--Metaphor is able to examine humanity with some distance and through a unique lens. It poses countless questions to its players, all while admitting the answers might not be simple or absolute. And yet, it places special emphasis on one question in particular: Does fiction have the power to shape our world?</p><p dir="ltr">By the time the game comes to a close, the answer is a resounding yes. Metaphor: ReFantazio is a beautiful exploration into how fantasy is a vessel for ideas and humanity even in the darkest of times. It understands the impact that art and the ideas transferred through it have on society, and asks us to both believe in and scrutinize the media we consume.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="27876394"

disgraced-yet-beloved Louis--are all well-designed, well-voiced, and utterly engaging, making them instantly appealing (or detestable) to players. Each offers their own exploration into the various aforementioned themes, weaving stories that are equal parts heart-wrenching and heartwarming. This depth is also afforded to the game's numerous side characters, which comprise the greatest and most fully-realized roster of social links in an Atlus game thus far.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The studio handles all these narratives with nuance and precision, demonstrating a respect for its players' intelligence as well as immense conviction in its own beliefs. In a time when games are all too often criticized for being too political, Atlus takes a firm stand on the side of compassion and makes it clear that there is virtue in addressing social issues, taking collective action, standing up for your ideas, and believing in a better future for both yourself and those around you. Living in fear and giving into hatred is easy, Metaphor reminds us. It is remaining hopeful and caring that takes strength.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being a lengthy game, Metaphor is phenomenally paced, with an appropriate amount of time dedicated to each area, character, and story arc. These arcs are all particularly memorable, too, as the game is filled with spectacle, off-the-wall situations that ward off monotony, and compelling plot twists. In that sense, the game often reminded me of the late '90s JRPGs I grew up playing--the ones filled with theatrics, humor, and a keen sense of adventure. It's an almost intangible and indescribable quality, but one that Metaphor undoubtedly possesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412473"></a><figcaption>Antagonist Louis looks out into a smoke-filled sky.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4412473-4378508-metaphor_refantazio%E2%80%94storytrailer_xboxseriesx_s%2Cwindowspc1-37screenshot-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, Metaphor markedly improves old-school, turn-based combat, addressing the most common complaints with the system--namely its slower pace--through smart button mapping, superb party flexibility, and the addition of light action-style combat. This all makes for battles that are strategic yet breezy, and dungeon traversal that doesn't overstay its welcome or begin to feel more like a chore than an adventure. The game's other systems, from its calendar and Royal Virtues to its Archetype tree, perfectly fit within the combat, creating dynamic gameplay that feels interconnected and immensely satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">Remarkable art direction and music further elevate the experience, as rather than use a single color palette, as Persona typically does, Metaphor leverages several different colors to convey various themes, tones, and amplify its sense of journey. Its music is similarly complex and juxtaposing, as it bounds between angelic choirs to frenzied chanting. Though its stories might be universal, there is an otherworldly quality to its visuals and music, reminding players that this world is dark and fantastical.</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless of when Metaphor: ReFantazio was released, it would remain an exceptional title. But in the year 2024--a year marred by political unrest, growing inequality, fear, distrust, misinformation, and division--no game feels quite as apt and essential. While not every work of fiction can change the world, or instill within it a goodness that has seemingly been stripped away, Metaphor: ReFantazio is a reminder that art can change us.</p><p dir="ltr"><i>Curious if your favorite game of 2024 made it in our top 10?
