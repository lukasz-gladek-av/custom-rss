But this is no ordinary manor. Its rooms--from twisting hallways and garden courtyards to sports facilities and curious dead ends--all reset at the start of each day. This leads to a fascinating roguelike mechanic, one where you need to create the best path to reach the fabled Room 46. Our Blue Prince guides hub has all the tips you need to help you get started with this deep dive into untold mysteries.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Blue_Prince_guides_hub">Blue Prince guides hub</a><ul><li><a href="#The_basics">The basics</a></li><li><a href="#Puzzle_rooms">Puzzle rooms</a></li><li><a href="#Passwords_and_safe_codes">Passwords and safe codes</a></li><li><a href="#Permanent_upgrades">Permanent upgrades</a></li><li><a href="#Progression__The_Antechamber__Room_46__and_the_Underground">Progression: The Antechamber, Room 46, and the Underground</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Blue_Prince_guides_hub">Blue Prince guides hub</h2><p>Our Blue Prince guides hub is organized into several sections. We focused on individual puzzle rooms, followed by boons that you can unlock permanently. We also discuss progression--i.e. reaching the Antechamber and Room 46--as well as activities beyond that point. Naturally, these articles contain <strong>spoilers</strong>, so read them at your own risk.</p><h3 id="The_basics">The basics</h3><p>These Blue Prince guides are all about the basics, such as the items that you might want for your runs and the resources that you need for continued exploration.

The ones that we've included here are those found in puzzle rooms. Some are fairly straightforward--i.e. logic and math--but others become more complex. There are even tasks with incremental difficulty increases if you complete them often.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-prince-parlor-puzzle-solution/1100-6530717/" data-ref-id="1100-6530717">Parlor Room</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-billiards-darts-puzzle-solution/2900-6422/" data-ref-id="2900-6422">Billiards/Darts</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-gallery-puzzle-solution/2900-6424/" data-ref-id="2900-6424">Gallery</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-room-8-puzzle-solution/2900-6425/" data-ref-id="2900-6425">Room 8</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-music-room-sheets-puzzle/2900-6434/" data-ref-id="2900-6434">Music Room</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-tomb-chapel-puzzle-solution/2900-6449/" data-ref-id="2900-6449">Tomb and Chapel</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/blue-prince-chess-puzzle/2900-6447/" data-ref-id="2900-6447">Chess Puzzle</a></li></ul><h3 id="Passwords_and_safe_codes">Passwords and safe codes</h3><p>In some areas in the game, you need to learn the correct password or numerical combination just to earn some goodies.

                <p dir="ltr">At the beginning of the year, Kinetic Games<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow "> announced an ambitious roadmap</a> for its first-person multiplayer scarefest Phasmophobia, which includes seasonal events, map reworks, and more. Today, the development team announced the first seasonal event of that roadmap, Cursed Hollow, which will run for three weeks starting April 17.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cursed Hollow event will bring Easter-themed decor--with a spooky twist, of course--to nine of the game's maps--with one of them being Bleasdale Farmhouse, which is one of the reworked maps from the roadmap. Jackalope totems will be available for collection during each run, but interacting with them will alter the rest of the run in both positive and negative ways.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png" data-ref-id="1300-4473638"></a><figcaption>A jackalope totem from the new Cursed Hollow update.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4473638-dotsjackalope.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cursed Hollow will also bring a revamped reward system, as objectives and rewards will come in both Community and Personal categories. Completing Community tasks will contribute toward the Community goal, while Personal objectives are player-specific and will unlock after the first Community threshold is met.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first of three seasonal events specified on the 2025 roadmap, with "Halloween" and "Holiday" also listed. Other updates on the roadmap include an overhaul of the player character options, a revamped evidence gathering system, and a new map along with the multiple reworks.</p><p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games's Phasmophobia first launched in 2020, when it rose to viral stardom after content creators picked up the game.

                <p>Onibi Studio--a newly founded game studio featuring industry veterans who worked on titles such as World of Warcraft, Baldur’s Gate 3, Fortnite, and League of Legends--has announced its first game. Tomo: Endless Sea is an anime-inspired, open-world action-RPG in which players will get the chance to tame mysterious creatures named Tomo, craft various contraptions, and explore a procedurally generated oceanic world known as Endless Blue. The game will also support online multiplayer, and is labeled as an MMO, in addition to its other genres. Tomo: Endless Blue is currently scheduled to release sometime in 2026.</p><p>Alongside its announcement, Onibi Studio shared a first-look at Tomo: Endless Blue in an adorable trailer that turns shockingly dark in its final moments. In it, two characters approach an island aboard a flying whale-like creature that is seemingly an island itself. The pair catch their first Tomo before delving into the ocean below, swimming to shore, and starting off on their own adventure on the voxel island. Throughout the entire trailer, an original song composed by Cécile Corbel--best known for her work on Arrietty--and sung by Ai Higuchi of Attack on Titan fame, plays. As for what happens next, well... you can see for yourself:</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tomo: Endless Blue - Official Reveal Trailer (ft. Ai Higuchi and Cécile Corbel)</p>
      </div>
<p>Though Minecraft-meets-Pokemon is an apt comparison for Tomo: Endless Sea, the studio has also expressed great emphasis on what sets it apart, such as the game's physics. On Tomo's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, Onibi Studio wrote, "Blocks have physics and can be used to create vehicles and contraptions. Whether it's a boat, crane, or airship, build your own machines block by block--with your creativity, the possibilities are endless." Additionally, the Endless Blue will include other features, such as arenas, ancient ruins, and "vibrant, bustling worlds that feel truly alive." Villages, their architecture, culture, stories, quests, dialogues, and people are all dynamically generated, according to Onibi, in an attempt to ensure no two locations are the same.</p><p>"When worlds end, fragments of their civilizations become islands adrift in the Endless Blue. As players embark on a journey to uncover the story of each procedurally generated island, they discover vibrant villages filled with characters and Tomo living their lives, every island and village a microcosm of a unique culture," Onibi Studio wrote in the game's press release. "The trailer peeks into just one story of many in the Endless Blue, giving us a slice of life in this infinite world where one may uncover unexpected secrets lying in darkness."</p><p>Tomo: Endless Blue is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3301510/Tomo_Endless_Blue/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> but does not currently have a release date. Below are a few images that showcase what gameplay will look like.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4474059,1300-4474060,1300-4474061,1300-4474062,1300-4474063,1300-4474064" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474059-steam_screenshot_01.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474060-steam_screenshot_02.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474061-steam_screenshot_03.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474062-steam_screenshot_04.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474063-steam_screenshot_05.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4474064-steam_screenshot_06.png"></figure>

                <p>When Palworld was first released in early 2024, one of the criticisms levied against the game in some circles pertained to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-palworld-and-its-massive-success/1100-6520490/" data-ref-id="1100-6520490">allegations of the developer using generative AI</a>. Palworld communications director and publishing manager, John "Bucky" Buckley, has now responded, discussing how these claims hurt the people at the studio. He also said the allegations are "complete nonsense."</p><p>Asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN </a>how the allegations of "AI slop" impacted the workers at Pocketpair, Buckley said, "Massively, massively, massively, massively."</p><p>"That is by far I would say the biggest kind of thing that was ever against us, still to this day. Go to any Palworld posts or any news article about Palworld, or Reddit post, you'll see someone say, 'I hate this company. They use AI,' and it's complete nonsense. It's upsetting," he added.</p><p>Everyone at Pocketpair was affected by these claims, Buckley said, especially the concept artists. "We have a few Pal concept artists, and two of them in particular who've been there since day one. They're not big fans of this kind of stuff, but it's very hard to counter this, which we did learn," Buckley said.</p><p>To counter these claims, Buckley said the studio considered asking its workers to make a video and discuss the matter, but "none of our people want to be on camera."</p><p>"The vast majority of our artists are female, and in Japan, it's not the way to go about things right now. So they don't want to be on camera, they don't want to be public, they don't want to have their names out there. And yeah, it's upsetting for them, still today it's very upsetting to hear these things," he said.</p><p>Buckley said that Pocketpair releasing an official Palworld art book "definitely made a big impact" to push back against the AI claims, but "not as much as we would've hoped, perhaps."</p><p>People connected Pocketpair with AI in part because its CEO responded positively to a post about AI years ago, Buckley said. Pocketpair also released a party game called AI: Art Imposter, in which players generate AI images and then the other people try to deduce what's real and what was made using AI. People took this to mean Pocketpair as a studio loves generative AI, but Buckley said this misses essential context.</p><p>Palworld has been steadily supported since release with ongoing updates, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">latest of which arrived in mid-March and added cross-play.</a> Palworld is available now on PC and console. It's included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass.</a></p>
