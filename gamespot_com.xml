                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake launches on Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC later this year. The new game features ground-up remakes of the first two Dragon Quest games in one package; and just like 2024's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, they will feature new "HD-2D" visuals, re-recorded soundtracks, updated gameplay, and even new content to flesh out both adventures. While Square Enix hasn't confirmed the release date (or even the final box art), preorders for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake</a> are already live at Amazon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No preorder bonuses have been announced for Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake, but we'll update this section if that changes.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering why Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake is launching a year after the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, it's because Dragon Quest III is a prequel story that takes place before the first two games, and all three make up what is known as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77,B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Erdrick Trilogy."</a> These are some of the few Dragon Quest games with overt connections in their storylines, but while III is a prequel, each game takes place hundreds of years apart, so you don't necessarily have to play III first (the original version released after the first two, after all). Nevertheless, if you're itching to play some classic Dragon Quest and want to experience the trilogy's in-game saga chronologically, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a></strong> is worth picking up--and as luck would have it, you can pick up physical copies on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X for just $50 (was $60).</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the latest mainline entry in the series, Dragon Quest 11, also calls back to the original trilogy in multiple ways--though we won't spoil the specifics. If you're curious to see how everything connects or feel like playing a more modern take on the Dragon Quest RPG formula, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a> on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC--and PC players can even grab it for <strong>50% off at Green Man Gaming. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Several other <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DDragon%2520Quest&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest games are on sale at Green Man Gaming</a>, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-2-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, which take place in alternate timelines that explore the "bad" endings of Dragon Quest 1 and 2, respectively.

                <p>Call of Duty's popular Nuketown map has been reimagined over and over again throughout the series, and the latest evolution of the map--focused on the stoner holiday of 4/20--has now been revealed. Activision also announced a variety of other extras coming to Black Ops 6 themed around marijuana.</p><p>The new Nuketown variant is called "Blazetown," and it'll be available in Black Ops 6 multiplayer with the Season 3 Reloaded update at some point in the future. It's likely it'll be available by 4/20. Activision has only shared one image of Blazetown, but it does confirm one of the buses is decked out with flower power.</p><p>Also coming to Black Ops 6 to celebrate all things ganja is a limited-time mode called Joint Operations. This includes five core mode variants, all with excellent names: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed).</p><p>The mode will make you trip out, eliciting "visual hallucinations" and sometimes shifting to a third-person POV to give you an out-of-body experience. The mode also includes double health and low gravity.</p><p>Finally, Activision announced that the popular stoners Jay and Silent Bob are coming to Black Ops 6 as playable characters. Players can deploy using their classic looks or their comic book versions--Bluntman and Chronic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186" data-ratio="0.56111111111111" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186"></a><figcaption>What a time to be alive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png"></figure><p>This DLC bundle includes the "Bluntman Stuntman" Krig C weapon and the "Chronic Unapologetic" Jackal PDW, along with the "Smoke You Out" finishing move, among other 4/20-themed items.</p><p>For more on Season 3, be sure to check out GameSpot's gallery below to see all the new content headed to Black Ops 6 soon.
