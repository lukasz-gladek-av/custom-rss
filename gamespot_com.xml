                <p>Beating the Ender Dragon in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft </a>technically marks the end of the game, as the credits will roll when you leave the area post-fight. However, there are several useful techniques and important mechanics that you need to know before you head into the fight with one of the strongest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs</a>. Here's how to find the Ender Dragon, how to beat it, and the rewards you'll get for slaying it.</p><h2 id="Items_to_bring_to_the_fight">Items to bring to the fight</h2><p>Before we get into the mechanics of the Ender Dragon fight, there are several items you should seek out and bring with you on the journey. You'll want to read our dedicated Minecraft The End guide for information on how to find The End and how to get there, but in terms of items that will be useful, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need three full stacks of scaffolding in order to reach the tops of the towers. You can bring normal blocks, but scaffolding allows you to go up and down at will, instead of relying on water buckets to break your fall from the top of the tower. If you're anything like me, you've failed at the water bucket trick too many times to count, so scaffolding is the safer option. Having said that, do bring a water bucket to protect yourself from the many Endermen that spawn in the fight arena.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174"></a><figcaption>Suggested items to bring to the Ender Dragon fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg"></figure><p>Bring a full stack of golden carrots to restore health if you do get hit quickly. Also, bring three stacks of empty glass bottles with you to collect the Dragon's Breath that pools on the floor. This is an important ingredient for several Minecraft potions, so it's well worth collecting while the fight progresses. To collect it, right-click with a glass bottle equipped when it pools on the floor, taking care not to step directly in it.</p><p>Bring your best weapons. For the Ender Dragon, this is a Netherite sword with your preferred enchantments, and a bow with the infinity enchantment at a minimum, as this gives you unlimited arrows. You'll also want full diamond or Netherite armor, with your preferred enchantments. If you'd prefer to avoid the Endermen completely at the sacrifice of limited vision, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet. This way, the Endermen won't attack you no matter how much you look at them.</p><p>Bring a bed and a chest with spare armor and weapons. Place the bed and chest next to the End portal, and set your respawn on the bed before jumping into the portal.</p><p>Finally, bring some stacks of building blocks, preferably cobblestone or something else similar to obtain, as the spawn into The End is random and you may find yourself on one of the area's many standalone platforms with no way to reach the Ender Dragon. Should this happen after jumping through the portal, you can create a bridge across to the main area.</p><h2 id="How_to_destroy_the_tower_crystals_and_cages">How to destroy the tower crystals and cages</h2><p>When you spawn into the Ender Dragon fight, you'll notice several pillars with End Crystals on top of them. Two of these towers will also have cages around the crystals. You'll need to climb the towers to destroy the cages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497175" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497175"></a><figcaption>Some towers have cages at the top.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>You can use your bow to shoot the crystals at the top of the towers. All of the crystals need to be destroyed, as they will heal the Ender Dragon. You can shoot the crystals from the ground, but if you're finding it difficult then use your scaffolding to ascend the tower to get a better angle to hit it from.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497176"></a><figcaption>Destroy the cages around the crystals with a pickaxe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>You will have to use the scaffolding to climb the towers to destroy the caged crystals, as the cages cannot be destroyed using projectiles. When you reach the top, use a pickaxe for the most efficient way to destroy the cage. Remember that there are two towers with cages. When the cage and crystal are destroyed, head down the scaffolding or use the water bucket to create a safe space to jump into.</p><p>If you destroy a crystal while the Dragon is tethered to it--signaled by a white beam between the Dragon and the crystal--it will cause the Ender Dragon to take more damage when the attack phase begins.</p><h2 id="How_to_avoid_being_killed_by_Endermen">How to avoid being killed by Endermen</h2><p>As mentioned above, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet to avoid Endermen attacking you. However, the limited visibility this provides often isn't worth it. Instead, try to avoid looking at them directly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182"></a><figcaption>An Enderman can't attack if you're stood in water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you accidentally do look at one for too long it will become hostile. Use your water bucket and stand in the middle of where the water was placed. If you stay in this safe area, the Endermen will not get closer and therefore cannot hit you with their melee attacks. However, the Ender Dragon can still use its Dragon's Breath attack, so keep an eye out for it as it will still do damage over time while you're standing in water.</p><h2 id="How_to_kill_the_Ender_Dragon">How to kill the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You can now begin to damage the Ender Dragon. Use your bow and aim for it as it circles in the air, keeping an eye out for its Dragon Breath attacks. Remember not to look at the Endermen during this time too, as if you anger one, they'll all become hostile and can actually prove more deadly than the Dragon itself at times.</p><p>The Ender Dragon has several hitboxes on its head, body, wings, and tail. Hitting it in the head causes the most damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192"></a><figcaption>Shoot the Ender Dragon with arrows when it's in flight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg"></figure><p>When the Ender Dragon lands on the perch made of Bedrock in the center of the arena, it's time for the next stage of the fight. Again, hitting it on the head will cause the most damage, but be careful of its flapping wings, as they'll cause damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193"></a><figcaption>The Ender Dragon dying</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png"></figure><p>It will still be using its Dragon's Breath attack, so use the glass bottles in your inventory to quickly bottle it up, or move away from it. As the Dragon's health depletes, it will periodically return to the sky to fly around before landing again on its perch. Keep attacking it with arrows in the air, or melee attacks when it's on its perch, until it's killed.</p><h2 id="Ender_Dragon_Drops">Ender Dragon Drops</h2><p>For defeating the Ender Dragon, you will receive several items. Firstly, you will get 12,000XP in orbs, so run around and collect them all for a huge amount of level boosts. It's enough to raise your level to 68 from zero, to put that into context. If you resummon the Ender Dragon and defeat it again, it will only drop 500XP.</p><p>Secondly, the Dragon Egg will spawn. To safely get it without destroying it, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Hit the egg once so it falls from the portal.</li><li>Mine underneath the egg and place a torch underneath the block it is sitting on.</li><li>Break the block it is sitting on, and it'll fall on the torch.</li><li>You can now pick up the egg and have it in your inventory.</li></ul><p>This also grants The Next Generation achievement. There is only one Dragon Egg in each Minecraft world, and there is no way to get more than one without using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">Minecraft mods</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194"></a><figcaption>How to pick up the Ender Dragon Egg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, defeating the Ender Dragon opens a portal to the End Islands, which gives access to things such as Elytra and Shulker boxes. The portals appear in random locations, and look like a cluster of blocks. There can be up to 20 portals around the main island, and teleport you large distances to the End Islands.</p><h2 id="How_to_resummon_the_Ender_Dragon">How to resummon the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You'll need four End Crystals to summon the Ender Dragon for a repeat of the fight. Place one End Crystal on each side of the perch where the Ender Dragon usually rests during the fight, on the central block. This will cause four beams to shoot up, one from each crystal, which will take it in turns to point to the top of each obsidian tower to create a new End Crystal, and the Ender Dragon will respawn when all of them have spawned.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195"></a><figcaption>Resummoning the Ender Dragon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you know all about the Ender Dragon, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.

                <p>The Warden is one of the deadliest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs </a>in the game, but it's actually not supposed to be treated like a boss. The best way to deal with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>Warden is to sneak around and avoid it, so that you can access valuable Ancient City loot. However, if you find yourself curious and wanting to look him in the eye, this guide will detail which Minecraft biomes to find him in, how to spawn him, and how to beat him if running away isn't as successful as you'd like it to be.</p><h2 id="How_to_find_the_Warden">How to find the Warden</h2><p>The Warden will spawn in Deep Dark caves, and you'll be able to tell if you're in an area where he can appear, as there'll be a lot of Sculk littering the ground and walls. Sculk is a deep midnight-blue block with flecks of electric blue. It starts off sparsely dotted around, but as the cave opens up, it becomes very dense and is joined by Sculk Sensors and Sculk Shriekers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160"></a><figcaption>The Warden will rise out of the ground when triggered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden doesn't automatically spawn in these areas, though. Instead, a player needs to trigger four Sculk Shriekers. You'll know the Shrieker has been activated as blue sonar waves will be emitted from it. To trigger one, you need to directly step on a Sculk Sensor or cause a vibration by moving or interacting with something close to it. The sensor will then send a signal to the Shrieker, which will make a loud noise. After triggering the Shrieker, or any Shrieker, four times, a Warden will rise from the ground, and the surrounding area will get darker.</p><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Warden">How to beat the Warden</h2><p>As mentioned, the Warden isn't really intended to be fought. By sneaking around and trying to avoid it, Mojang introduced a horror-like suspense to Minecraft that'll have your heart racing. As the Warden is blind and relies on sound, vibration, and smell to seek out nearby threats, he can't detect you if you're sneaking past it. His audible heartbeat gives a good indicator of how close he is, even when the room is pitch black.</p><p>If you're going to try running from the Warden, you can distract it with throwable items like snowballs or arrows, as the noise and vibration from them landing elsewhere will entice the Warden in their direction. However, you must either sprint away as soon as it's at the distraction location or continue to sneak in the opposite direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162"></a><figcaption>The Warden's sonic boom is a powerful ranged attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden will react to you running, jumping, mining, building, or attacking anything and will turn and sprint towards you. If it reaches you, it has a ranged sonic boom attack which deals 6HP damage, and an even more painful melee attack dealing 16HP damage, meaning it'll make quick work of killing you unless you're out of its reach.</p><p>If you do choose to fight the Warden, one technique we've used is crafting a lot of anvils and building a tower out of its reach, dropping the Anvils on its head. It has 500 health points, so it's not easy to take down, but not impossible. Should you manage to kill it, it will drop five experience points and a Sculk Catalyst.</p><p>If you're looking for more tips and tricks, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>, which covers<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-show-your-minecraft-coordinates/1100-6531264/" data-ref-id="1100-6531264"> how to show your coordinates</a> if you're lost seeking the Warden, and what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-differences-and-which-to-play/1100-6531281/" data-ref-id="1100-6531281">Java vs Bedrock </a>differences are.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> creative director Neil Druckmann has announced that he is currently working on another Naughty Dog title in addition to the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Though we've known for some time that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">currently working on multiple projects</a>--and that's excluding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-went-wrong-with-the-last-of-us-online-according-to-an-ex-sony-exec/1100-6529585/#:~:text=The%20Last%20of%20Us%20Online%20was%20one%20of%20those%20games,who%20got%20to%20play%20it." data-ref-id="1100-6529585">recently canceled</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-online/" data-ref-id="5000-565972">The Last of Us Online</a>, to be clear--this is our first confirmation that Druckmann is involved in a game other than Intergalactic. Considering Druckmann has confirmed that he does have a concept for The Last of Us III and felt like there would probably be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">one more chapter to the story</a>," it seems entirely plausible that the second game could be a new entry in The Last of Us series.</p><p>Druckmann shared the big news on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08x7kb5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Press X to Continue podcast</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), stating: "There's another game that's being worked on at Naughty Dog where I'm in more of a producer role and I get to mentor, watch this other team, and give feedback and be the executive in the room. I enjoy all those roles, and the fact that I jump from one to the next makes my job very exciting and always feeling fresh. I’m never bored."</p><p>The creative director also clarified that he is currently working on Intergalactic alongside two other Naughty Dog directors, Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau, and co-writer Clair Carré. VGC noted this means that Naughty Dog still has two other prominent game directors who are currently unattached to any of its announced projects: Shaun Escayg (Uncharted: The Lost Legacy) and Anthony Newman (The Last of Us: Part II).</p><p>Though it is possible that the studio could be hard at work on a new IP, all signs point to Druckmann's unannounced game being The Last of Us Part III. After all, Naughty Dog has stated it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uncharted-5-could-happen-with-another-developer-di/1100-6438426/" data-ref-id="1100-6438426">no plans to continue the Uncharted series</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/85465867?utm_campaign=postshare_creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">prominent video game leakers</a> have hinted that the game is in development for quite some time now.</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">recent remarks</a> from HBO's The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin have only fueled these rumors. Following the show being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">renewed for a third season</a>, Mazin stated that a fourth season will "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">be essential,</a>" which is curious considering the current pacing of the television series and how much source material remains. This paired with the fact that Mazin <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">previously said</a> he will not take the HBO show "past the game" make it seem like it's only a matter of time until The Last of Us Part III is announced.</p>

However, one of the newest outfits is notably weird even by Fortnite standards: You can now play as Darth Jar Jar, but you'll need to grind a <em>lot </em>of XP to be able to buy the skin.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/darth-jar-jar-descends-upon-the-fortnite-shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, developer Epic Games announced a number of accessories for evil Jar Jar that are now available to purchase. These include a wrap, a pickaxe, a back bling, and the full outfit. However, these specific items are locked behind XP benchmarks, which players can earn in any Fortnite mode. To unlock the ability to buy all of the items, you'll need to amass 1,280,000 XP. Depending on how committed to grinding out XP you are and the modes you play, this will likely take at least several hours of gameplay to earn.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has provided a detailed overview of the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> carrying case and what Switch 2 game cards look like.</p><p>In a new video posted on the Nintendo Today app, the company showed off the carrying case, which can store the console, two Joy-Con straps, and six game cards. In this video, we also get our closest look yet at Switch 2 game cards. While they look pretty similar in size and shape to original Switch cards, they are almost entirely bright red--making them immediately visually distinct from the slate-gray cards of the previous console.

<p>The carrying case, which <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-carrying-case-screen-protector-123697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">goes for $40 on Nintendo's store</a>, has a flip-down flap that appears to have snug slots to hold up to six games. It also has a zipper pocket, which is shown storing Joy-Con wrist straps.</p><p>Nintendo has been steadily rolling out additional details about the upcoming console on the Nintendo Today app. Last week, for instance, we learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-controllers-gl-gr-buttons-are-more-customizable-than-we-thought/1100-6531549/" data-ref-id="1100-6531549">Switch 2's new GL/GR buttons will be mappable on a per-game basis</a>, providing players additional control customization in comparison to the original Switch. In addition, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-includes-these-helpful-gamechat-accessibility-features-report/1100-6531631/" data-ref-id="1100-6531631">a number of helpful accessibility features</a> coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">the new GameChat functionality</a>.</p><p>Switch 2 launches on June 5, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders quickly sold out</a> and have since been widely unavailable in the US. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">Nintendo has said that its higher price point</a> may suppress early adoption, although it is still expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 consoles in the 2026 fiscal year</a>.</p>

It's not the first time that we've seen a pretty stacked lineup of games for the brand, and if you're on PC, <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Grab+8+Xbox+Game+Studios+Hits+For+Only+%2410+This+Week&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-19+13%3A11%3A31&amp;fnarticle_id=6531624&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fxbox-games-studio-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-xbox-game-studios-hits-for-only-10-this-week%2F1100-6531624%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab eight Xbox Game Studios PC games for only $10</a></strong> from Humble Bundle right now. You'll want to be quick, though, because <strong>this deal expires on May 24</strong>. Each game here will be provided as a key that can be redeemed on your Steam account.</p><p>The Xbox Games Studio bundle includes several blockbusters with a few titles that might have escaped your notice. You've got Remedy's fascinating blend of scripted TV and time-bending action in Quantum Break alongside the interactive drama As Dusk Falls, as an example. Another highlight here is Sunset Overdrive, a cheeky response to the deluge of cover-based shooters doing the rounds back in the early 2010s and developed by Insomniac Games, a studio that has since gone on to establish itself as the developer behind the best Spider-Man games.</p><p>Strategy game fans can also pick up Age of Empires: Definitive Edition for an impressively upgraded tour of history, Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a tightly constructed metroidvania with soul-stirring art, and Broken Age is a puzzle-filled adventure game from Brutal Legend developer Double Fine. You can grab the Battletoads remake as well for a surprisingly solid action-adventure featuring a trio of weird heroes named after terrible skin conditions. Up to three players can battle it out, and the game has a lovely hand-crafted art direction.</p><p>Like other Humble Bundle deals, proceeds will go toward charity. Humble partnered with Gameheads for this bundle. Gameheads is a tech training organization focused on teaching game development skills to people from all walks of life.</p><h2>More Humble Bundle deals</h2><p>A few other bundle deals are also available right now.
