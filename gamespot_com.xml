                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the chairman and CEO of Take-Two, has once again shared his thoughts on AI in the video game space, and he believes the technology is "great" but people are overstating what it can do.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/ai-is-a-combination-of-metadata-with-a-parlor-trick-take-two-boss-says-a-great-thing-for-business-but-its-not-creative-and-never-will-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a> that Zelnick said at the Paley International Council Summit this week that, "AI is a great thing" for "every industry," including video games. But it's not a magic wand.</p><p>"Will it recreate or create genius? No. Will it create hits? No. It's a bunch of data with a bunch of compute with a language model attached," he said.</p><p>The executive added that AI will probably be able to help people work more efficiently, but AI is not a forward-looking technology that can actually do anything creative.</p><p>"What AI is, is the combination of big datasets with a bunch of compute within natural LLM—a large language model," Zelnick said. "And by definition, a data set is what? Backward-looking. By definition, creativity is what? Forward-looking. And to the extent that AI appears to be forward-looking, it is what? A predictive model."</p><p>What's more, Zelnick pushed back on the claim that AI will lead to net losses in jobs, citing historical evidence to make his point. "In 1865, 65% of the US workforce was involved in agriculture. Today we make food for America and food for the rest of the world. And 2% of the workforce is involved with agriculture. And I defy you to find anyone who recently said to you, 'It's so horrible, I can't get a job as a farmer,'" he said.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said the term "artificial intelligence" is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">oxymoron</a> because machines cannot learn. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>Zelnick also previously talked about how people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p>

                <p>The rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">a Simpsons-themed season of Fortnite</a> began earlier this year, but it's been picking up steam in the last few weeks. Now, some apparent leaks have revealed which Simpsons characters will be in the battle pass, and what fans can expect from the map of Springfield.</p><p>According to this leak, the battle pass includes Homer Simpson and his wife, Marge Simpson. Ned Flanders appears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-collab-could-feature-a-flanders-skin/1100-6535598/" data-ref-id="1100-6535598">confirm a previous rumor</a>, but there's no sign of Bart, Lisa, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-add-moe-from-the-simpsons-in-next-major-update-it-seems/1100-6535664/" data-ref-id="1100-6535664">Moe</a>. Instead, Peely Remix and Fishsticks Remix round out the battle pass. A <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20306" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kang and Kodos UFO glider</a> has been found, but it was also left out of the battle pass.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-springfield-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6535560/" data-ref-id="1100-6535560">map of Springfield</a> has also unofficially dropped, and it appears to be a collection of landmarks from the Simpsons' hometown themed over a traditional Fortnite island rather than a complete map of the city.</p><p>A few of the recognizable locations on the map include Evergreen Terrace, Springfield's town square, the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns' manor, Krusty Burger, and the Duff Brewery. Another leak suggests that Fortnite will begin the build up to the new season later today by placing Bart's treehouse in the game.</p><p>A short Fortnite season will launch on November 1, but Epic Games has yet to confirm it will be The Simpsons-themed season. The Simpsons TV series is closing in on its 40th anniversary in 2029, but the characters have been largely absent from consoles for almost two decades. Recently, a team of modders revisited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-and-run/" data-ref-id="5000-18218">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> and turned it into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/simpsons-hit-run-designer-loves-fan-made-futurama-re-skin/1100-6535602/" data-ref-id="1100-6535602">Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</a>. The Simpsons Movie 2 is also scheduled to release in 2027.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6's mysterious, but confirmed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode</a> could release as soon as next week as a shadowdrop. That's according to a datamining effort and information from sources.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1981663452465955165" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Henderson of Insider Gaming</a> said the battle royale mode will shadowdrop on October 28. As for the datamining details, something called "Granite" has reportedly been discovered in the Battlefield 6 game files. <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1981108370502537707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Modern Warzone</a>, meanwhile, reported that this is the battle royale mode and it is indeed coming on October 28 as a shadowdrop.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has confirmed it's working on a battle royale mode but has not shared specifics about it yet, including whether it will be free or paid. It wouldn't be the first shadowdrop of a battle royale game, as EA released Apex Legends back in February 2019 without much pre-release hype.</p><p>EA tried its hand at the battle royale space for Battlefield years ago with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-5-firestorm-gameplay-new-battle-royale/1100-6465748/" data-ref-id="1100-6465748">Firestorm mode for Battlefield V back in 2019.</a> The mode didn't exactly catch on, however. The new Battlefield 6 battle royale mode will go up against titles like Fortnite, PUBG, Call of Duty: Warzone, and others.</p><p>EA has been testing Battlefield 6's battle royale mode with the Battlefield Labs testing community. The developer just recently provided an overview of some of the changes for battle royale. These include (<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by EA</a>):</p><ul><li><strong>Close-range TTK:</strong> We’ve adjusted time-to-kill at close range for all weapons to reward clean positioning and tracking while giving players more time to counter attacks. We’ll keep monitoring this once it’s live.</li><li><strong>Armor Changes:</strong> Everyone will now have the capacity for 2 armor plates at the start of the game. All players will spawn with 1 plate, so you will have the chance to upgrade as soon as you start looting, giving everyone an equal chance at upgrading their armor fully.</li><li><strong>World Improvements:</strong> We’ve been fixing pesky world bugs and optimizing areas to improve the environment. With these improvements, we made adjustments to the lighting as well as enhancing the visibility across the map.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Balance:</strong> We’ve adjusted the balance for helicopters and combat vehicles to keep them as powerful tools showing off Battlefield’s core DNA, without making them necessary to survive or win the late game. This includes significant adjustments to the heli countermeasures and ammo economy.</li></ul><p>October 28 is also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6's Season 1 arrives</a>, ushering in new maps and modes for multiplayer.</p><p>Battlefield 6 got off to a good start following its release on October 10, selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">7 million copies right away</a>, representing the "biggest opening" of all time for the series.

                <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard has teased that "even more" Fallout is coming, with many taking that to be a suggestion about more games in the series. This would be no surprise, given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Bethesda first revealed it was making Fallout 5 years ago.</a></p><p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IZm-Hws334" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fallout Day broadcast</a>, Howard said the team is aware that fans want to see more Fallout. He responded, "Just know, we are working on even more. We're looking forward to the day when we can share that with everybody."</p><p>Not long ago, a report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was now "fully greenlit"</a> following its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/" data-ref-id="1100-6504615">initial reveal in 2022</a>.

Fallout 76, meanwhile, is getting a new expansion in December and PS5 and Xbox Series X|S ports in 2026.
