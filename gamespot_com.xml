                <p dir="ltr">I like robots--especially comically large ones armed with various weapons. When I received an invitation to visit Amazing Seasun Games' Irvine, California office to try out their latest title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/">Mecha Break</a>, all I really knew going into it was that I'd be playing a game featuring really big robots armed with various weapons. I'm not quite sure what I was expecting (other than access to the aforementioned giant robots), but I <em>certainly</em> wasn't expecting to fall in love.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Amazing Seasun Games' previous titles were unknown to me, and all I'd seen of Mecha Break were some impressive trailers. When I finally sat down to take the free-to-play mech-based third-person hero shooter for a test-fly, I was admittedly a bit apprehensive. The live-service hero shooter market is oversaturated enough as it is, and it's a tough genre to stand out in. Is Mecha Break up to the task? So far, the answer appears to be "yes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452072"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break is mech-nerd heaven.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452072-mb1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game features a cast of 13 different mechs--referred to in-game as Strikers--each with their own set of unique weapons and abilities. When selecting a Striker, players can look at a graph showing that particular mech's strengths and weaknesses. Some Strikers are great for lone-wolf playstyles, some are better at supporting or defending one's team, and some are a combination of both. Each Striker feels surprisingly well-balanced--while I quickly fell in love with a specific Striker that fit my preferred playstyle (more on that in a bit), I never felt that one Striker was too overpowered or underpowered.</p><p dir="ltr">But before I get into the nitty gritty of Mecha Break's gameplay, I have to take a second to praise the game's absolutely phenomenal character creator. Before you set foot in a mech, you must first create the character who will be piloting it. You can pick from a series of masculine and feminine preset characters, but those options can then be customized. At most, I was expecting a simple customization screen that might let me choose from a handful of hairstyles and colors. What I was not expecting was a character creator so detailed it rivals that of RPGs like Cyberpunk 2077. While there aren't many body shapes to choose from, the sky's the limit when it comes to everything else.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can customize their pilot's hair color (including roots and tips), every part of their eyes (from sclera to pupil) and other facial features, their makeup (including eyeshadow, eyeliner, blush, lipstick, and lip gloss), scars and tattoos, and more. Outfit colors can also be customized on an extremely detailed level, and players are given the ability to choose from a wide variety of colors. I had to physically tear myself away from the character creator--one could easily spend an hour or more perfecting their pilot's look. In the end, I had a female pilot with heart-shaped pupils, impeccable makeup, and beautifully animated waist-length hair with a black-to-purple ombré dye job. While playing, I encountered pilots with equally varied looks, including one who was wearing a sailor uniform and had a PC monitor for a head. (I later learned this pilot belonged to none other than Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break Game Director, Kris Kwok, who joined us for a few matches.)</p><p dir="ltr">Additional customization options like clothing colors, hairstyles, tattoos, and eyeliner designs can be purchased using an in-game currency that you earn for free while playing the game, which is a plus. After just a few hours, I had more than enough currency to customize every inch of my pilot ten times over. While items like pilot outfits will likely be sold via an in-game store when the game is released, the build I played allowed for plenty of customization without the need for players to spend real-life currency. Oh, and players can also customize their Striker as well as its pilot, using the same in-game currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452073"></a><figcaption>Character customization is extremely detailed, and doesn't cost a dime of real-life currency.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452073-mb2pilot.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After reluctantly dragging myself away from the incredibly detailed character creator, I climbed into a Striker and tried out three game modes. The first was your standard 3v3 team deathmatch-style mode. The second was a 6v6 mode that really leaned into hero shooter mechanics, with different maps having different objectives--one map had my squad protecting a moving payload from an enemy team as it traveled across the map, while another saw us fighting to control a series of three map points in a king-of-the-hill-style match. The third mode, called Mashmak, is Mecha Break's "signature mode," according to its developers.</p><p dir="ltr">Mashmak is a PvPvE mode that sees 10 three-player teams dropped into an absolutely <em>enormous</em> map, where they must defeat both AI-controlled enemies and player-controlled squads, collect loot, and--if they want to keep that loot--reach an extraction point. The extraction point appears 10 minutes in, but you don't have to hit it immediately, as another extraction point will spawn every five minutes for the remainder of the match. But you don't want to wait too long--after 15 minutes, a Pulse Storm will begin devouring the map. You can delay this to some degree by destroying some of the drones controlling the storm, but ultimately, the appearance of the Pulse Storm is your sign that it's time to extract as soon as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to being visually appealing, Mecha Break's Mashmak maps are absolutely enormous. Each of the game's Strikers has the ability to fly long distances (though some have bigger fuel reserves than others), and during the preview event, we were told that even if the Strikers had infinite fuel reserves, it would still take roughly <em>10 minutes</em> to fly from one end of the map to the other. Mecha Break's maps aren't just wide, however--they also have a huge amount of verticality. Players can fly up and over the side of large mountains which, in most games, are usually put there to keep players penned in. This is not the case with Mecha Break--if you can see it, you can fly over it. Of course, there's a limit--fly too high and an alert will appear on screen alongside an out-of-bounds timer, signaling players to lower their altitude--but I didn't often find myself flying too close to the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">One might imagine that with a map this big, keeping a squad together might be difficult, but in my experience, that wasn't the case. Mecha Break's Strikers fly fast and far, fuel reserves replenish quickly, and as long as you're communicating with your team, you're unlikely to find yourself in a situation where your squad is too far away to help.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452121"></a><figcaption>Mecha Break's maps are absolutely enormous, and quite beautiful.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452121-mb6airborne.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of going airborne, flying in Mecha Break feels <em>amazing</em>. The game's developers lean into airborne combat, rather than shy away from it, so each Striker has decent fuel reserves and can stay airborne for quite a while. I played the game with both mouse-and-keyboard controls and an Xbox controller, and both input methods felt equally seamless when I took to the sky.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat, too, felt seamless and satisfying. I played around with a few different mechs, but quickly found my favorite Striker in Alysnes, an agile, sword-wielding mech with an arsenal that also included a machine gun, a shield, and a special ability that shoots deadly lasers in multiple directions.. Mecha Break has an interesting lock-on mechanic--keep an enemy in your line of sight for a brief moment and a large red triangle will appear around them, indicating that your target is locked, and you're free to fire away. The lock-on mechanic works the same way for every Striker, and if you lose sight of an enemy, you'll have to get them back in your field of vision and lock on again if you want to continue attacking them. Thankfully, locking on doesn't take long.</p><p dir="ltr">Alysnes' gun does decent damage, but I had far more fun using her sword. With her sword equipped and her target locked, Alysnes will zoom toward the enemy and begin slashing away. If that target happens to be in the air, she will automatically go airborne as well, leading to tons of intense, mid-air fights to the death. Speaking of death, what happens when your Striker's health hits zero depends on the game mode. In non-Mashmak matches, your pilot will automatically eject from their mech, and you'll be removed from the battle for a brief time period before redeploying from the sky to rejoin your teammates. In Mashmak mode, your fellow squadmates will have to respawn you themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">In its current state, Mecha Break feels like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/">Titanfall 2</a> if you gave it a can of Red Bull and let it spend the day playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/">Armored Core</a>. It's an incredibly good time, and does a great job of making you feel like you really are piloting a gigantic robot--bridges crumble when you forcefully land on them, parts of buildings break apart when you send an enemy crashing into them, and while the Strikers feel appropriately hefty, they never feel clunky.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452122"></a><figcaption>Locking onto enemies is easy--just keep them in your line of sight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452122-mb5lockon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Aside from the lack of variation in pilot body shapes and a few instances of rather silly looking jiggle physics on feminine pilots, it's truly difficult to find much to complain about when it comes to Mecha Break's current build. Unlike a lot of newer hero shooters currently on the market, Mecha Break appears to have a well-defined identity--it knows what it is, and it knows who it's for. Though there are plenty of similarities to Titanfall, it never feels like a rip-off, and while the Alysnes Striker <em>does</em> feel a lot like Titanfall 2's Ronin Titan, Mecha Break's Strikers operate differently--and frankly, more gracefully--than Titans. You can't manually eject your pilot and run around ripping batteries out of other mechs, nor does each Striker have a unique voice and distinct personality for you to grow attached to, but that doesn't feel detrimental to the quality of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Mecha Break doesn't have a single-player campaign, but there is a tutorial mission, and the game has an ongoing plot revolving around the mining of a strange, crystal-like element known as Corite. Amazing Seasun Games says that the story will be supported with additional media, including manga and animated shorts. But even if you completely removed the plot from the equation, Mecha Break could still stand firm (and fly high) on the foundation of its gameplay, which thus far is engaging, smooth, satisfying, and frankly, fun as all hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Curious to learn more about Mecha Break's development, I sat down with Amazing Seasun Games CEO and Mecha Break game director Kris Kwok to find out how exactly this high-flying hero shooter got off the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">"I came to Hong Kong when I was very young, so I got to know [of] mecha when I was very young, maybe when I was in the second or third year of primary school," Kwok told me. "So, for Mecha Break, my biggest inspiration would be these works: First of all, Gundam. Secondly, Macross."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the complexities of the game--13 mechs with various abilities, multiple modes, enormous maps--I was curious to hear what sort of challenges the development team faced while working to bring Mecha Break to life.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the Chinese market, as long as you're doing something sci-fi related, [or] mecha-related, there's almost no beginning," Kwok said. "If you want to do something, you'll be the first one [to do it]. So, in terms of hiring the right people and getting the right technology in place, we had barely anything to begin with. In the beginning, we invested in a British team. We learned a lot from the British team. Their original [idea] was to do it on PS2, a space-fighter shooter project. In the end, we've experienced several failures. The second time, we worked with the UK team, our team, and [a team of] Japanese designers. We failed. Then, we did it ourselves--we asked the Japanese designers to be our consultants. We failed. In 2021, I think we learned a lot. In this process [of failure], we learned a few key techniques that allowed us to break through. In terms of design, [that breakthrough was] the design language of mechas, [which] deviate from the traditional, low-quality toy-looking kind of appearances, and [look] way more cool."</p><p dir="ltr">Another challenge was making Mecha Break's mechs look appropriately robotic.</p><p dir="ltr">"You cannot just map the skin onto a human body, because mechas don't move like humans," Kwok explained. "We had to re-design the animation of the mecha's skeletal structure, and then we had to follow up with animations in that sense. The second [challenge] in terms of technology was hard surface modeling. We had to make it [look] really hard, very industrial looking. Through numerous iterations, we mastered that as well."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452123"></a><figcaption>Kwok says getting Mecha Break's Strikers to look realistically robotic was a challenge.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452123-mb3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we were on the topic of animation and modeling, I had to know: Why add such a detailed, RPG-esque character creator?</p><p dir="ltr">"Amazing Seasun Games already has a reputable history for the past three decades of making Chinese-themed traditional wuxia games," Kwok explained. "So, we kind of transferred those core competencies over to the character-creation stage. We don't want you just to identify with the hard metal mecha surface--there's an actual person behind it: The human, the pilot, that you can eventually identify with. If you get to create a character that physically looks like you, the player, you will have a stronger sense of immersion in the world. <em>You</em> are playing that mecha, <em>you</em> are the pilot."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazing Seasun Games has held a number of community playtests, so the next thing I wanted to know was how player feedback has shaped Mecha Break's development. Kwok told me that he and his team have received a ton of player feedback regarding the game's user interface and gameplay balance.</p><p dir="ltr">"In terms of the feedback that we've gotten, mostly it's in terms of the product itself, the UI, the experience, etc.," Kwok said. "So we're working on that too. And the balance takes time, you know? Nobody can get it right the first time. I'm not surprised that we've gotten a lot of feedback in terms of balance as well, and the players had expectations of PvE in addition to PvP."</p><p dir="ltr">It was at this point, Kwok said, he and the team were faced with a monumental decision: Should there be a single-player campaign?</p><p dir="ltr">"A [single-player] campaign is a one-time-through kind of deal," Kwok said. "So we kind of decided against it."</p><p dir="ltr">Another aspect I was curious about was balance. My experience with Mecha Break was smooth and seamless, and there was never a time where I felt one of the game's 13 mechs had a massive advantage over the others, or a blatant weakness in need of addressing. I asked Kwok how on Earth the team went about balancing the game's lineup of mech-heroes, and which mech was his favorite. The answer truly surprised me.</p><p dir="ltr">"So, first of all, as the producer and designer of all that--I'm not talking about the aesthetics or the outward appearances [of the mechs], but the weaponization was all done by me, myself--for me, each of them is like my own child," Kwok told me, explaining that he had personally spent hundreds of hours playing and perfecting each mech. "So, it's hard for me to tell you which one I like the most, because I had to play each one of them many times, try a lot of things, and constantly modify them.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, balance is a very, very difficult process. So in this process, the question is, 'Which one is the most difficult to balance?' I can't say which one is the most difficult to balance. In terms of balance in this game, I'd rather stay away from the traditional buffing [or] nerfing some units, giving them more stats, HP, armor, all that."</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Kwok added that he's more focused on "the actual player's control in-game, rather than giving you a number to tell you which one is the hardest to balance. It's always an ongoing process, there's no endpoint [to] a game's balance anyway."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452124"></a><figcaption>Balancing the abilities of all 13 Strikers was no small task, Kwok says.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4452124-mb4gameplay.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's clear that even while tweaking small details, Kwok always has his eye on the big picture first and foremost. When I asked what aspect of the game he was most excited for players to experience, he simply told me, "Actually, I think [I'm most looking forward to the reception of] the game as a whole. At its core, what we want to create in the game is the feeling of driving a machine gun. Whether it's 6v6, Mashmak, or 3v3, we want all players to feel like, 'Okay, I'm really driving this machine, I'm controlling this machine, it's like part of my body.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"I'm counting on the player to experience that kind of integration, unity, the pilot being one with the mech," Kwok said.</p><p>Mecha Break does not yet have an official launch date, but is slated for release on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2025. It is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" rel="nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>It's been almost five years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/axiom-verge-2-surprise-releases-on-switch-today-alongside-six-other-games/1100-6495049/" data-ref-id="1100-6495049">Islanders</a> gave cozy-game lovers a casually engaging city-building experience. Now, Coatsink has announced that a sequel, Islanders: New Shores, is coming to consoles and PC this summer. In the first-look video below, New Shores retains the appealing aspects of the first Islanders while teasing some of the new features that will be integrated into the gameplay.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lAgsVJxyJ4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8lAgsVJxyJ4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As in the first game, New Shores allows players to develop cities and structures on a series of breathtakingly gorgeous islands and transform them as they see fit. Each level begins with a number of buildings at players' disposal, but they also have consider where the structures should be placed in order to get the maximum amount of points during the stage. Earning those points allows additional buildings to be unlocked, which opens the door to even more options.</p><p>One of the new features introduced in New Shores is called boons. It's a one-time power-up that's unlocked on each stage as players collect points. Boons can allow players to perform some of the more difficult tasks in a single action, including the creation of duplicate buildings and the destruction of others to make way for something new. However, boons should be used sparingly, since some of the trickier levels may need them more than the earlier levels do.</p><p>New Shores is introducing an additional sandbox mode that has a save system that is separate from the high score mode. A photo mode has also been added to preserve players' favorite creations or even just pictures of the beautiful islands themselves. To share the experience, Coatsink is adding Twitch integration to New Shores, as well as the option for viewers to vote on which buildings to pick.</p><p>Islanders: New Shores will be available on Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Beyond the Summer 2025 window, Coatsink hasn't set a specific release date yet.</p>
