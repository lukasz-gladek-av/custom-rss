                <p dir="ltr">With the arrival of new endgame content in a Monster Hunter Wilds update earlier this week, a pesky <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-knows-about-that-monster-hunter-wilds-crashing-bug-is-working-on-a-fix/1100-6533906/">crashing bug also snuck into the game</a>. But Capcom has stated that the issue has now been addressed with a hotfix. <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.01.00.html" rel="nofollow ">The patch notes</a> also point to a couple of other problems getting rectified with version 1.021.01.00.</p><p dir="ltr">The crashing bug could be triggered by fainting or utilizing fast-travel to get back to camp. Capcom quickly became aware of the problem after releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">the major update for the action-RPG</a> on August 12. That patch actually saw the company move up endgame content--such as tempered versions of monsters like Rey Dau in nine-star quests--from the still-planned Title Update 3 in September.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the official gameplay reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 scheduled for Gamescom Opening Night Live on August 19, Call of Duty-related teases have begun to surface all across the internet. Even other Call of Duty games aren't immune, as a short vignette has begun playing on screens in Warzone matches--and it features a face that should be familiar to Black Ops fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Call of Duty social media accounts have uploaded the clip, which will randomly begin playing on video screen around the Warzone map. The short video features Raul Menendez, a recurring villain in the Call of Duty world, speaking directly to the player when he appears, and when the clip ends, a Secret Challenge called "Watch Menendez's Threats" is earned.</p><p dir="ltr">"My name is Raul Menendez. As you can see, I am still alive and well," Menendez says in the teaser. "2025 was just the beginning. A necessary first step. Once again, you shall know fear." 2025 is a reference to Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, in which the campaign was set in the year 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 was officially revealed as the final announcement of the Xbox Showcase in June. A recent report claims that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final mission of the Black Ops 7 campaign</a> will be a 32-player multiplayer in an "extraction-based" experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will launch later this year for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has said he believes Microsoft is at a "fork in the road" and is questioning whether the company will keep releasing consoles.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-two-make-it-cheaper-and-simpler-lets-do-that-instead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, Layden said there will certainly be more console generations to come, but Microsoft may not be part of that story. "Watching what Xbox has been doing recently, I do get Dreamcast flashbacks," he said, referencing how Sega got out of the console business after the Dreamcast and became a software company.</p><p>"I think Sega realized they just were better off being a software house. I think Microsoft is in that same sort of fork in the road. And I don't think their hardware offering is persuasive enough to make up the ground they've lost," he said.</p><p>If Microsoft were to get out of the console-making business, that would indeed be big news--and it would be unexpected given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft just recently signed a multi-year deal with AMD for future hardware</a>. Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room <em>and </em>in your hands," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-now-has-another-job-at-a-different-company/1100-6533857/" data-ref-id="1100-6533857">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-hardware/1100-6522486/">Bond has said in the past</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-gen Xbox hardware</a> will focus on "delivering the biggest technological leap ever in a generation." It remains to be seen what that means, however, as some are theorizing that a new Xbox console could be more akin to a gaming PC. Microsoft is also branching out into the handheld space with its partnership with Asus for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/" data-ref-id="1100-6532506">upcoming Xbox ROG Ally devices.</a></p><p>Layden said he hopes to see some kind of standardization for consoles in the future, and it's his belief that going this way could help the total market for console gaming grow.</p><p>"Can't we look at the game console business kind of like Blu-ray, or cassette, or compact disc, or any other medium where the industry decided we'll compete on content, but let's standardize on format?" he said. "And then let's take that format and license it out to everybody who wants to support it. That's what stops the penetration rate of console gaming, I think."</p><p>For what it's worth, Sony is said to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">new PlayStation console</a>. And while Nintendo just recently released the Switch 2, the company is not likely to give up dedicated hardware anytime soon.</p><p>For now, there is no indication that Microsoft will stop making consoles, but the company has changed its playbook somewhat in recent times. The company is now bringing many of its games to rival platforms, like PS5 and Switch, in a bid to generate more revenue. And the plan is seemingly working, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">some of the best-selling PlayStation games are made by Xbox. </a></p>

Today, the team revealed a few of the fixes on the way in the game's next big patch--which include netcode fixes, achievements finally unlocking, and more--while also teasing a cross-play update in the next patch. </p><p dir="ltr">Rematch Patch 2 will fix multiple netcode issues players have encountered in the game's first two months, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2138720/view/625556610639462619" rel="nofollow ">the official patch notes</a> on the game's Steam page. Examples provided in the news post include "tackles not registering" and "goalkeeper dive rollbacks causing goals to be scored when they shouldn’t."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Rematch GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The patch will also fix an issue where achievements earned by a player wouldn't unlock on that player's profile. The patch notes do clarify, however, that some achievements fixed with the patch won't unlock automatically--for example, if the Pro and Expert achievements didn't unlock despite the player after reaching Level 10 and 30 respectively, the achievements will unlock the next time that player levels up.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes post also teases that cross-play will finally be coming to the game in the next major update, Patch 3. "Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce cross-play to the game," the post says. "Some gameplay tweaks might also be introduced in Patch 3 (looking at you, Ippy Slide), but that’s still to be confirmed."</p><p dir="ltr">Players interested in checking out the changes in Rematch Patch 2 can do so by downloading and installing the Rematch beta app, which is available to all players who purchased the game on Steam. Beta progression is separate from main account progression, however, and only a few modes will be available in the beta test, including the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3v3 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">5v5 Quick Match</li><li dir="ltr">Customization (only the starting/default items will be available)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rematch is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

                <p>Diablo 4's next class could be the long-awaited Paladin, if the name of an internal build recently spotted on Blizzard's servers is to be believed.</p><p dir="ltr">As originally spotted by Spanish site <a href="http://diablonext.com/" rel="nofollow ">DiabloNext</a> (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/paladin-class-may-join-diablo-4-in-upcoming-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Icy Veins</a>), an internal build for Diablo 4 named "2.5.Xpaladin.67961" allegedly made its way to Blizzard's servers, seemingly hinting that a Paladin class could be in the works.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2.5 numbers in the build name appear to be referring to patch 2.5, which would line up with Diablo 4 Season 11, since Season 9 is currently on patch 2.3. Though it seems unlikely Blizzard would release the Paladin before a major expansion (which would see the build number jump to the 3.0 designation), it's possible some part of a Paladin class might be included as part of the patch 2.5 update, even if the class isn't fully playable or is only included for testing purposes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754"></a><figcaption>The Paladin as seen in Diablo 2: Resurrected.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As explained by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/it-might-finally-be-time-for-paladins-to-debut-in-diablo-4-updated-encrypted-378150" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, previous Diablo 4 builds have used the codename Fenris, making the build name change to Paladin even more curious. The name change could simply be another codename that has no actual bearing on in-game content, like Fenris. Until Blizzard makes an official announcement, it's impossible to know for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Paladin is one of two original Diablo 2's classes that have yet to appear in Diablo 4, and as such is by far the most-requested class among the game's community. It would hardly be surprising then if Paladin does show up as part of the game's next expansion, which is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">arrive sometime in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo content creators have been hyping up Diablo 4's future in recent weeks, with some having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">attended a secret meeting</a> to learn more about what's next and others even <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1956009614019035397" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being flown</a> out to Blizzard HQ to give hands-on feedback on a new feature. Might they be testing the Paladin? That's unclear, but what is clear is that Blizzard certainly seems to be gearing up for some bigger announcements.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's Diablo team has been shaking things up in more ways than one recently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Diablo franchise head Rod Fergusson left Blizzard</a> after five years, and the studio announced it would be making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">big changes to how it talks to the Diablo 4 community</a>, doing away with its Campfire Chat livestreams and instead hosting a live chat through Discord. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">Diablo 4 is also being prepped to release in China</a>, having received government approval last month. Blizzard even seemed to tease <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">new content for Diablo 2</a> to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary, though nothing has officially been announced.</p>

Co-op has always been central to the Borderlands games, as well as its spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, so it shouldn't be too surprising that the feature is back and seemingly better than ever in Borderlands 4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Amon Character Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For one, Borderlands 4 continues the franchise's streak of including split-screen co-op for up to two players, and allowing those players to then take their game online. This means that the game will be able to support a full online party of four players where each duo is sharing a screen.</p><p>The same Wire post makes mention of the fact that Borderlands 4 will apparently have a streamlined lobby system, the ability to freely drop in and out of sessions, and dynamic level scaling, which has long been a staple of the franchise.</p><p>As an interesting new wrinkle, Borderlands 4 will introduce the ability for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/" data-ref-id="1100-6533956">vault hunters</a> to teleport to one another. In the past, Borderlands has allowed for teleportation between fast-travel spots, and even offered vehicles for players to speed up the process of moving through the world manually, but it has never outright allowed players to zip to one another's side in an instant like this.</p><p>The change seems to be motivated by Borderlands 4's new open-world design, which moves the series away from the zone-based approach the games have typically employed. As a result, Kairos, the upcoming game's entirely new setting, is seemingly quite large and designed with plenty of points-of-interest dotted around the map that might draw players in different directions. There don't appear to be systems limiting how far apart players can be, so squads can theoretically divide and conquer during a session and then come back together if a skirmish starts getting too tough.</p><p>Despite the introduction of this new form of fast travel, Borderlands 4 will once again feature player vehicles in the form of the personal Digirunners, and even appears to feature new movement mechanics, like balloons the player can use to zip up into the sky and then glide through the immediate area.</p><p>In short, when you boot up Borderlands 4 there will be a bevy of quality-of-life features ensuring that you and your vault-hunting friends have a painless time getting around and playing together. Borderlands 4 launches on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12, and will be coming to Switch 2 a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> upcoming Legion Remix event is looking to make some big changes to one of the MMORPG's most popular expansions. In addition to letting players and their Artifact weapons become more powerful than ever before, Blizzard is taking some key inspirations from Diablo to add some new twists to the beloved expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same vein as last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">Mists of Pandaria Remix event</a>, Legion Remix is set to go live alongside WoW's 11.2.5 update later this year and will be a speedrun of sorts through 2016's Legion expansion. Players will create new "timerunner" characters and experience faster leveling times, increased reputation gains, and an accelerated weekly content lockout schedule to make progressing even faster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0me06Fvcs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nb0me06Fvcs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are, however, some big changes from last year's remix event, as recently <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224370/watch-the-latest-wowcast-to-learn-about-legion-remix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> by Blizzard. Instead of Mists of Pandaria Remix's ever-upgrading cloak and gem system, Legion Remix will instead double down on Legion's expansion-defining Artifact weapons. Players will earn an upgrade currency that can be used to upgrade their Artifacts even further than in the original Legion, with new upgrade trees that will see players embracing one of five different damage types--Nature, Fel, Arcane, Storm, or Holy. They'll also be able to find jewelry slot items that can add additional ranks to Artifact traits, increasing the weapon's power even further. Thankfully, players will be able to freely respec their Artifact weapon traits at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">Power for power's sake is nice, but Blizzard is introducing some additional challenges for players to put their upgraded Artifact weapons to the test. A new feature inspired by Diablo's world tiers will allow players to upgrade the difficulty of the game's open-world content to Heroic. Enemies will have more health and, in another move from Diablo, affix-like buffs that will make them even more difficult to overcome but yield greater rewards. In yet another page from Diablo's playbook, powerful shrines, called Timewarped Obelisks, can be found through the open world that grant players powerful temporary buffs. As Legion introduced the Mythic+ dungeon system, it will be back in Legion Remix with the expansion's original affixes, as well as four new ones for players to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of the appeal of Mists of Pandaria Remix was as a means to earn exclusive cosmetics or hard to obtain items from the original expansion. Legion Remix is no different, though Blizzard has taken some criticism from the last go around. A frequent complaint during Pandaria Remix was that it was annoying that the event's central currency, Bronze, was used to both purchase cosmetics but also to upgrade gear, often making players choose between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Bronze is coming back for Legion Remix, but this time it will only be used for buying cosmetics. Gear upgrades will instead come from simply doing more difficult content, which should eliminate some of the tension found in Pandaria Remix between upgrading or buying event-exclusive cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">On the cosmetics front, players will be able to earn all kinds of new loot, including fel-infused versions of Legion's class mounts and a corrupted version of Varian Wrynn's swords. Blizzard is promising "plenty of never-before-released mounts, transmog sets, and more" as part of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas Pandaria Remix released with all of the expansion's content at once, Legion Remix will instead roll out Legion's content updates every two weeks. Each update will increase the maximum item level players can achieve. In a change from Pandaria Remix, characters can be transferred from Legion Remix to the current, The War Within version of the game early as opposed to having to wait for weeks until the end of the event. Transferred characters will be stripped of their Remix-specific items and abilities and given a new set of level-appropriate gear, though Blizzard warns that transferring a character early is a one-way trip and can't be undone.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know exactly when Legion Remix will arrive, but it will likely be in the next 6-8 weeks, in keeping with Blizzard's fairly consistent update cadence. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">WoW's latest 11.2 update, Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, took players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals. The update looks to perfectly tee-up WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, which is set to be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>.</p>
