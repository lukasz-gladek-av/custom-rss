Not only can the game's dangerous enemies put an end to you quickly, but groups of other raiders can be roaming the wasteland, ready to take you down and steal all of your loot. Having a good team can help ensure that you extract safely. But what if your friends don't play on the same hardware as you? Let's take a look at whether ARC Raiders offers cross-play and cross-progression.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-play?</h2><p>If you're looking to play with friends on other platforms, you're in luck. <strong>Arc Raiders offers cross-play with every platform</strong>, allowing you to team up with your pals even when they're in a different ecosystem. To play together, simply add your friend's Embark ID in the Friends menu by selecting Add Friend. This ID will include four unique numbers at the end, so be sure to include those, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593137"></a><figcaption>You can brave the conditions together using Arc Raiders cross-play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4593137-arcraiders_16-9_04.jpg"></figure><p>Cross-play is enabled by default, meaning you won't need to turn on any additional settings when you're ready to team up. To disable crossplay, go to <strong>Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Cross-play</strong> and toggle it off. This will ensure you only play with players that are within your ecosystem. As such, you'll need to turn this back on again if you decide to play with friends on another platform.</p><p>Once you're ready to go on with your pals by your side, don't forget to take our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a>, too.</p><h2>Does Arc Raiders have cross-progression?</h2><p>There's more good news for those setting out into a post-apocalyptic Earth: <strong>ARC Raiders has full cross-progression support</strong>. This means that you can carry your progress across every platform. If you start on PS5, for instance, you'll be able to use the same save on PC or Xbox so long as you're signed into the same <a href="https://careers.embark-studios.com/connect/login" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark account</a>.</p><p>However, it's important to note that playing across different platforms will require you to purchase the game multiple times. If you've bought the game on PS5 and want to play on PC or Xbox, be prepared to dish out an additional $40 to transfer that save over. Luckily, you can swap between these platforms at any time with no issues, so you'll never have to worry about losing your progress.</p>
