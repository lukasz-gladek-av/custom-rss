That's because PokePark Kanto is slated to open in early 2026, with advance ticket sales starting later this year for the Tokyo-based attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">The new PokePark Kanto details were shared as part of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6784/#1">Pokemon Presents</a> livestream. According to The Pokemon Co., this will be "the first permanent outdoor Pokemon attraction" ever. It's built upon two main areas--the previously mentioned Sedge Town and Pokemon Forest--and sits on 26,000 meters of land at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yomiuriland" rel="nofollow ">Yomiuriland</a>. The Pokemon Forest aims to show Pokemon in natural settings, while Sedge Town will see trainers and Pokemon sharing space together.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZAe5ewM-ic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="330">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zZAe5ewM-ic?start=330" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One interesting note about PokePark Kanto is that it's not set in a Universal theme park. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-in-orlando-opens-next-year-check-out-a-first-look/1100-6523129/">Super Nintendo World opened at Universal Orlando</a> earlier this year, with similar Mario parks at Universal Studios Hollywood and Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">PokePark Kanto was first announced in December 2023, according to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/a-new-pokemon-theme-park-is-launching-in-japan">Nintendo Life</a>. Kanto is the setting for the first games in the series, Pokemon Red and Blue. The theme park will open 30 years after the Game Boy titles launched in 1996 in Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, The Pokemon Co. also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-friends-is-a-brand-new-pokemon-game-out-today-for-switch-2-and-more/1100-6533330/">revealed Pokemon Friends for Switch systems and mobile devices</a> today.

Most seeds won't grow in regular dirt, so you'll need to do some work to it before you can start a farm. It's best to protect your designated farm plots with a fence to keep out any unwanted mobs.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_make_farm_plots">How to make farm plots</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529998" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529998"></a><figcaption>9x9 farmland example with one water block in the center</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529998-farmplotexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">First, craft the hoe tool, which allows you to turn dirt blocks into farmland. You can then place most types of crops in the game in these blocks of land. You'll also need a water source, but you don't need a lot to water the crops. One block of water will hydrate a 9x9 section of farmland when you place the water in the center square.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crop_farming_tips">Crop farming tips</h3><p dir="ltr">Light is also important for most of the crops, but it doesn't need to be natural light. You can grow crops indoors as long as you place plenty of light sources around the area. An example of indoor farming can be seen in the image below. You'll also want to put torches around your outside crops to keep them growing at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529999" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529999"></a><figcaption>Indoor farming with potato crops using torches as light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4529999-potatocrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To farm faster, use bone meal directly on the plants to accelerate crop growth.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, some crops will have more specific water and growing requirements, and we'll discuss those in the sections below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Each_growable_crop_in_Minecraft">Each growable crop in Minecraft</h2><p dir="ltr">In the sections below, we'll guide you through finding and planting each type of growable crop in Minecraft.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_grow_wheat">How to grow wheat</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530000" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530000"></a><figcaption>Wheat crops</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4530000-wheatcrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Wheat seeds are obtained by breaking normal grass.

Completing these quests unlocks those plushes and increases your friendship level with townsfolk. "Grateful townspeople will give rewards, including furniture, which you can use to decorate your in-game plush rooms," the game's description says.</p><p>Pokemon Friends is also available on mobile devices as a free download, but on Switch and Switch 2, it's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for $10 from the eShop.</a> This includes the Basic Pack, which comes with 30 puzzles, 70 craftable plushies, and 11 yarn types.

                <p>Ironmouse, a female VTuber widely considered the most successful on Twitch, has announced that she is leaving the agency that represents her. Ironmouse has been part of the VShojo agency since November 2020, but in a video posted to <a href="https://youtu.be/MwLbGcUMy6g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">her YouTube channel</a>, she alleges that the company owes her "a significant amount of funds," and that it failed to donate more than $515,000 that she raised for the Immunodeficiency Foundation charity.</p><p>Ironmouse has a rare primary immune deficiency disease known as Common Variable Immunodeficiency, or CVID, meaning that she has a low- to near-non-functioning immune system. This disease means that Mouse spends almost all of her time bedridden, getting sick a lot, and having to remain isolated. When Ironmouse began streaming, she just wanted to see if she could "make some friends" but she was afraid to show her real face online. That's when a friend suggested that she try using an anime avatar, and she became a VTuber.</p><p>After being approached to join VShojo in 2020, Mouse says she spent a long time "considering" whether she could become a corporate VTuber or not. Ultimately, she decided that the benefits of retaining her anonymity and having VShojo handle her payments were good reasons to proceed, and she joined the company in November of 2020. Since then, she and her online friend<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPsZ_0SkFdi551iYTG04R2g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> CDawg</a>, real name Connor, have raised more than $4 million for the Immunodeficiency Foundation through online subathons, where viewers contribute subscriptions on Twitch to raise money for the charity, Cycleathons, where Connor will cycle an extended distance taking donations, and other charitable events.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLbGcUMy6g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MwLbGcUMy6g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ironmouse has done two subathons during which she decided to donate half of her revenue to the Immunodeficiency Foundation. The first of these she says went off without a hitch, and VShojo--as the company handling her Twitch payments--successfully donated more than $329,000 to the Immunodeficiency Foundation. Her second subathon in September 2024 saw her beat the all-time Twitch subscriber record of 306,621 previously held by Kai Cenat. This meant that over $515,000 had been raised for the Immunodeficiency Foundation, and once again Ironmouse says she asked VShojo to make the donation on her behalf. "Unfortunately, still a year later, VShojo has not paid the charity," she explains.</p><p>Ironmouse explains that the Immunodeficiency Foundation is a charity that helped her immensely when she was going through her diagnosis, feeling "scared" and unsure of what would happen next. "This entire situation has broken me. I just wanted to do something good and to give back to a community that helped me, but unfortunately that's not the case," she continues. Mouse goes on to confirm that she wishes she could talk in more depth about the situation, but that she has been advised to wait for legal proceedings.</p><p>In solidarity with Ironmouse, other VTubers that are represented by VShojo have begun to remove the agency's name from their social media handles, and informing their communities that they will be streaming soon to explain what their next steps are--raising the question of whether the controversial situation could cause other talents to leave VShojo, too.</p><p>VTuber Kson has <a href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently streamed</a> to announce her departure from the agency, and alleged that VShojo has failed to pay her since September 2024. "I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation," she explained, "My payments stopped last September. I was asking what's going on for a long time, multiple times. All they said was, 'It's going to be paid,' and it was never paid, and I think it will never be." Kson continues to explain that the reason she waited so long to reveal the information and quit the agency is due to doubts that the money would ever be paid. "That was scary for me," she said.</p><p>Kuro has <a href="https://x.com/K9_KURO/status/1947656711524798886" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also announced</a> that he "submitted a leave contract" 11 days ago--it's unclear whether he was aware of Ironmouse's situation at the time of submitting that request. </p><p>VShojo had been under scrutiny recently as three of its talents left the agency since May 2025, as well as the former CMO and director of talent both resigning. VTubers who were formerly members of VShojo have also spoken out about the Ironmouse situation, with Zentreya--who left the agency earlier this month--posting that her "heart hurts for the VShojo community" and encouraging people to support one another. Current VShojo members Kuro Kurenai, Apricot, Henya, Hime Hajime, AmaLee, and Michi Mochievee publicly issued support for Ironmouse.</p><p>Ironmouse has published a <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify link </a>that is raising funds directly for the Immunodeficiency Foundation. At the time of writing it has raised over $334,000. She will continue to stream as an independent VTuber.</p>

                <p>A new look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> was revealed during today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-july/1100-6531854/" data-ref-id="1100-6531854">Pokemon Presents livestream</a>, showing off more of the game in action.</p><p>The new trailer focused on Z-A's story, which centers around a group of Trainers called Team MZ, who protect Lumiose City and the people and Pokemon within. The player will be recruited into Team MZ as soon as the game begins, and they'll be introduced to Naveen, Lida, Urbain, Taunie, and the rest of the team soon after.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eo7PmXkP0LA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Eo7PmXkP0LA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will also meet Emma, a detective in need of help with some cases around the city, and Mable, a researcher who asks the player to catch Pokemon for help with research. The trailer also introduced Rogue Mega Evolutions--special in-game battles against particularly tough boss characters--as well as a new Mega Evolution for Dragonite.</p><p>Scheduled to launch on October 16 for both Switch 2 and Switch, Pokemon Legends: Z-A takes players back to the Kalos region and Lumiose City for a new adventure. The Paris-inspired city was introduced in Pokemon X and Y for the Nintendo 3DS, and since then, the vibrant metropolis has undergone some significant urban redevelopment.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-its-big-twist-on-gameplay/1100-6530425/" data-ref-id="1100-6530425">There have also been some big changes</a> to the gameplay of this Pokemon game, as players will duke it out in Pokemon battles that are held from dusk til' dawn as they seek to level up in the the Z-A Royale tournament.</p><p>Combat unfolds in real time instead of the turn-based format from most Pokemon games, and positioning plays a key role in determining victory. Players will be able to enter Battle Zones to take on other trainers and improve their overall ranking in the game's tournament. On top of that, the game will also offer new characters to meet and plenty of wild Pokemon to capture.</p>
