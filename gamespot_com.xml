                <p>Earlier this year, Discord began testing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discords-new-age-verification-requires-id-or-face-scans-for-some-users/1100-6530915/" data-ref-id="1100-6530915">a new age-verification process</a> in the United Kingdom that required users to scan their government-issued ID. That has come back to haunt both Discord and the users who shared that info, as a new report suggests that millions of people may have had their ID and other info exposed during a recent data hack.</p><p>According to a statement <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Discord's official site</a>, the government-issued ID of 70,000 users may have been exposed when a third-party service provider, 5CA, was hacked. Discord had contracted 5CA to handle age-verification duties. Discord went on to state that none of its messages were breached beyond exchanges with customer support or trust and safety agents.</p><p><a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/discord-data-breach-sensitive-data/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyber Security News</a>' follow-up report puts the number of stolen government IDs at 2.1 million, and added that the final number of affected people may be approximately "5.5 million unique users across 8.4 million support tickets."</p><p>The report adds that the hackers attempted to extort Discord with a total of 1.5 terabytes of stolen data, which potentially includes usernames, email accounts, IP addresses, and the last four digits of credit card numbers. Discord has stated that full credit card numbers and CCV codes weren't included in the breach, and added that it is working with law enforcement while notifying affected users by email.</p><p>The ID photographs of the affected users could also be leaked, which was one of the reasons the UK faced pushback over this requirement. 5CA appears to have been responsible for manual reviews for users whose IDs were initially rejected or people who were appealing age-related suspensions.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo attempted to subpoena Discord to discover the identity of a user responsible for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-trying-to-subpoena-discord-over-massive-pokemon-leak/1100-6531036/" data-ref-id="1100-6531036">a massive Pokemon leak</a>. A Congressional Republican has also called upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/congressional-republican-calls-on-discord-steam-twitch-ceos-to-testify-about-radicalization/1100-6534837/" data-ref-id="1100-6534837">Discord, Steam, and Twitch CEOs to testify</a> in front of Congress over alleged radicalization on their platforms.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At the end of 2022, an unknown number of online leagues in Madden 23 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/">deleted overnight</a> due to what EA called a "data-storage issue that resulted in Franchise files being corrupted." Some players who were affected eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-restores-a-limited-number-of-madden-cloud-franchises-others-lost-for-good/1100-6510742/">got their leagues back</a>, while others never did. The total number of affected players or leagues was never revealed, but it wasn't an especially rare event, as the game's subreddit, EA Forums, and various Discord servers were flooded with players decrying their leagues' disappearances. Now, in Madden 26, something similar seems to be happening.</p><p dir="ltr">It hasn't occurred in one fell swoop, and a different--possibly more hopeful--error message is greeting affected players, but it's unclear why it's happening or if affected leagues can be salvaged.</p><p dir="ltr">The error message some players are getting reads, "Error: The requested league is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience. You have been returned to the Franchise launcher."</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, this is the message players may see if they try to access their league while a patch is being rolled out. But in this case, some players have been stuck staring at this message for weeks. One player in my league said his other league has been inaccessible for a month and a half. Yesterday, our 32-player league was hit with the same bug. We're now tentatively structuring our Plan B in case we need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of forum threads in which players are worried about their leagues having become permanently unavailable, like <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/re-franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12680427" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12702061" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-franchise-is-temporarily-unavailable/12646488" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. In fact, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/category/madden-nfl-26-en/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en" rel="nofollow">browsing by Franchise-related posts turns up many similar threads</a>. Naturally, the same is happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1o29f5l/madden_franchise_error/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234"></a><figcaption>Madden leagues are locking players out without apparent rhyme or reason.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if the issue is happening more recently, but it's definitely affecting different leagues at different times, rather than hitting a number of leagues all at once like in 2022. Some players have reported that their leagues came back to life after a few days, while others have given up after weeks of waiting. On the EA Forums, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-league-error/12635493/replies/12725728" rel="nofollow">community manager provided an update yesterday</a>, saying, "Apologies for the late reply on this one. We have notified the team that this has been happening with the leagues, and they are currently investigating this. Once we have more info on these or need any further information, we will update this thread."</p><p dir="ltr">This latest Franchise lockout doesn't seem to be occurring for the same reasons as when it happened in late 2022, but for affected players, the result is the same: A great deal of investment, sometimes hundreds of hours, is getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted EA for comment on this issue and will update this story if the publisher responds.</p>

                <p>In Battlefield lore, a Rendezook is a legendary maneuver that dates back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a>. It's become so ubiquitous with the series that DICE included a Rendezook in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-trailer-references-the-rendezook-feat-and-one-of-the-creators-is-stoked/1100-6492598/" data-ref-id="1100-6492598">the Battlefield 2042 announcement trailer</a>.

It would be an impossible stunt to pull off in real life, but a player who goes by Stun_Gravy discovered it was possible in Battlefield 3 and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOaGhE_sejI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared a video to prove it</a>.</p><p>The word Rendezook is the combination of rendezvous and bazooka, and it's become such a popular term that it earned an entrée in the <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=rendezook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Urban Dictionary</a>.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is officially out today for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

Within the game's first 30 minutes of public availability, it exceeded 500,000 concurrent users, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Steam's own data.</a> The free games Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2 are the only two games rank higher than Battlefield 6 currently.</p><p>At press time, Battlefield 6 stands at more than 606,000 concurrent players on Steam.</p><p>A massive launch for Battlefield 6 was expected.

In the US, it's a long weekend with a holiday on Monday.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is, of course, also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. However, the platform-holders do not share up-to-the-minute player data like Valve does with Steam.</p><p>So far, the Battlefield 6 servers appear to be holding up against the influx of players.
