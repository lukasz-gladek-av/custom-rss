                <p>After almost a decade, Katamari is back with Katamari Damacy Rolling Live, which launches exclusively on Apple Arcade. Five other games are joining Katamari starting April 3: Space Invaders Infinity Gene Evolve, Puffies, Atari's RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic+, The Game of Life 2+, and Sesame Street Mecha Builders+. All games are free of ads and in-app purchases.</p><p>Like other installments of the franchise, Katamari Damacy Rolling Live has players roll the Katamari as ordered by the King of All Cosmos to gather objects in a giant, chaotic ball to fill the sky with stars. This time around, it incorporates a "streaming" aspect.</p><p>Now, players have to energize the king's "livestream" by rolling their Katamari to create stars once more. As the game goes on, in-game fans appear in the "comment section," and the longer they play, the larger their audience grows. Players advance the game by completing the kingâ€™s challenges and boosting their subscriber count.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457722-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4457722" data-ratio="0.4599609375" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457722-1%285%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4457722"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457722-1%285%29.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457723-1%286%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457725-1%284%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457726-1%283%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457727-1%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4457723,1300-4457725,1300-4457726,1300-4457727" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4457723-1%286%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4457725-1%284%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4457726-1%283%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4457727-1%281%29.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457723-1%286%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457725-1%284%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457726-1%283%29.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4457727-1%281%29.png"></figure><p>After a moderate success in Japan, the Katamari Damacy series became a cult classic and one of the top-rated games back in 2004.

                <p>BlizzCon will be back for 2026, Blizzard has announced, in the process confirming the convention will not happen this year. The developer's (usually) annual fan expo will return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September 2026 after having taken two years off.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas the vast majority of BlizzCons have happened in November, BlizzCon 2026 will instead happen two months earlier on September 12-13. In a press release announcing the date, Blizzard did not give more details or an explanation as to why the event is happening several months earlier than usual, nor why a 2025 event isn't happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've come a long way since our first event in 2005," Blizzard said in a press release. "Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It's important that we put on an event worthy of our community."</p><p dir="ltr">Many BlizzCon staples, like the announcement-heavy opening ceremony, in-depth panels about what's next for Blizzard's games, competitive tournaments, and more will be a part of the 2026 expo, Blizzard confirmed, additionally stating it aims to "elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not announced when tickets will go on sale but said to sign up on the official BlizzCon website to receive updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">Blizzard said it decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> It went on to say it was a decision it didn't make lightly as "BlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you look forward to it." Blizzard at the time said it was "excited as ever" to bring back BlizzCon in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">While there was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/" data-ref-id="1100-6515587">BlizzCon 2023</a>, there wasn't one in 2022, with Blizzard instead opting for a digital-only presentation. Assuming BlizzCon 2026 does happen as planned, that will mean there will have only been two in-person BlizzCon events in the preceding five years.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of making major announcements at BlizzCon, Blizzard in 2024 instead revealed what's next for the Warcraft franchise during a 30th anniversary livestream (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing in World of Warcraft</a>) and announced new details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, as part of Summer Game Fest</a> and Gamescom 2024.

Sony was heavily involved in the development of the first game--and assisted Kojima Productions in completing the reveal trailer through its PlayStation Studios Visual Arts group--but given the company's recent approach to porting more of its console-exclusives to PC in the years since Death Stranding launched, it's highly likely that Death Stranding 2 will make its way to that platform eventually.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Kojima is keeping the Death Stranding 2 story under wraps for now, but he has revealed a few details about the game since its official debut, while the first trailer has also hinted at a new calamity on the horizon as the unstoppable Death Stranding continues. The story for Death Stranding 2 that Kojima originally had in mind was thrown out after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with Kojima remarking that he restarted from square one. "I had the story written before the pandemic. But after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole story from scratch," Kojima said at the Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"Should we have connected" is the main crux of the story, as following Sam's journey to help establish the United Cities of America, the world has changed. Deliveries are now automated, a dangerous new cult seems to have emerged, and Higgs Monoghan has somehow managed to escape the Beach after he was stranded on it toward the end of the first game. Throw in a hulking samurai outfitted in red armor, kaiju-sized tar-monsters, and new locales, and Death Stranding 2 looks like it'll be greatly expanding on the ideas of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA," the official plot synopsis from Kojima Productions reads. "Sam--with companions by his side--sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles, and a haunting question: should we have connected?"</p><p dir="ltr">If you sift through the reveal trailer, there's a whole bunch of fascinating threads to explore, ranging from the state of the world after more connections had been made, the return of Fragile, who is in a much healthier state now, and possibly a multiverse of variants to deal with.

This time, Reedus will be joined by a few new faces as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/"> Elle Fanning</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-game-features-deadpool-2-actress/1100-6508796/"> Shioli Kutsuna</a> are in the cast. Reedus once again plays Sam Porter Bridges, and he's joined by Lea Seydoux (Fragile) and Troy Baker (Higgs Monaghan), two characters from the first Death Stranding.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new actors include Mad Max director George Miller as Tarman, the captain of the DHV Magellan and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/"> Fatih Akin as Dollman</a>, one of the more interesting additions to the series. True to his name, Dollman is a living puppet who'll join Sam on his journey, and who isn't afraid to pick a fight with people like Higgs. Speaking of Higgs, the self-proclaimed particle in all things is sporting a wild new look, resembling a cyberpunk version of the Crow. There's also Neil, another new character who is the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/"> spitting image of Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series</a> when he dons a bandana, as seen in the release date trailer.

dir="ltr" id="Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">The first Death Stranding was essentially a puzzle game, as players had to guide Sam to his destination and figure out the best route and equipment to help him deliver his cargo in one piece. Sure, the game also had action and stealth as you were forced into fights with package-stealing Mules and the ghostly BTs haunting parts of the map, but the real core of the game was focused on the journey and the destination ahead of you. Adding an extra wrinkle to the gameplay was timefall, a weather phenomenon involving deadly rain that could steal the time of anything it landed on before becoming harmless water, and staying outside too long during one of these showers could ruin a cargo run.</p><p dir="ltr">For Death Stranding 2, it looks like that mix of genres has been expanded on. Couriering cargo, for example, looks even more dangerous thanks to other weather phenomena like bushfires, lightning storms, and avalanches. To make things easier, it looks like Sam will have access to a new fleet of vehicles that can traverse this deadly ground, as well as exoskeletons and floating carriers.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also looks like it has been beefed up, especially with all of the new enemies that you'll encounter. Human foes seem to be smarter this time. we've glimpsed horrifying hand-monsters in the wild, and we're going to need a much bigger gun to take on the skyscraper-sized tar-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Asynchronous multiplayer will also return in the sequel via the Social Strand system, which helped foster a feeling of connection in Death Stranding. Essentially, this allowed players to have an impact on the world, leaving behind useful tools, gadgets, and vehicles for other players to find in their expeditions once certain areas had been connected to the Chyral Network. We're not certain if or how this system has been expanded, but if it's anything like the one seen in the first game, it'll be a welcome feature as players lend a hand to each other in a dangerous world.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSN1rPPKK9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSN1rPPKK9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding's soundtrack is a highlight of that game, as chill beats to relax to at the end of the world made for a meditative experience. We know that Woodkid composed the song "The Wilder" which was heard in the SXSW trailer and that you can listen to in the video above. This isn't the first time that the French music video director has worked with Kojima, as he previously teamed up with the director to create the song "Goliath" for the Death Stranding: Director's Cut trailer. Beyond that,<a href="https://youtu.be/krSy6fI0SBU?t=2038" rel="nofollow "> Woodkid also has several other tracks</a> that'll be in Death Stranding 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Scottish music trio Chvrches also contributed some of the best tracks to the game, and while they haven't been formally contacted to create some new material for the sequel, the band says that it'll be ready in a hot second if Kojima approaches them again.</p><p>"There's nothing formal yet. Weâ€™ve talked [and] we've hinted heavily at each other that we would both like to collaborate again," Chvrches synth player Martin Doherty<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chvrches-talks-death-stranding-2-is-ready-to-return-if-kojima-calls/1100-6512094/">said in March</a>. "There's sort of a dance going on right now. I don't want to be rejected by all out saying, 'Can we be on the game please?' and [Kojima] says no. But I donâ€™t know. We're continuing to build a really special relationship with Hideo. And I think we get him and I think he gets us. If the call comes in to do more then of course, we'll be there in a second."</p>

Each mouse pad was built with a different material and offers a unique texture. The QcK Performance Series is out now and available to order directly from SteelSeries.</p><p dir="ltr">We had the opportunity to test the new mouse pads and can attest that each one feels distinct from the other, but all three offer a premium feel. SteelSeries is offering two different sizes for each variant: Large for $40 and XL for $50. The Large is 19.3 x 16.5 inches, which means it offers substantially more space than the average mouse pad while still mainly intended as a surface for mouse movement. If you want a full desk mat with enough room for your keyboard and other accessories, the XL is the way to go since it measures in at 35.4 x 15.75 inches.</p><p dir="ltr">All mouse pads in the QcK Performance Series have 3.5mm non-slip neoprene foam bases and low-profile stitched edges. We've broken down all three QcK Performance surface types below and included comparison images of the two different sizes. </p><div title="6530026 - SteelSeries QcK Performance mousepads" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3243" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530026 - SteelSeries QcK Performance mousepads" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/steelseries.com\/gaming-mousepads\/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control">QcK Performance Control Mouse Pad</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https:\/\/steelseries.com\/gaming-mousepads\/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://go.skimresources.com?id=225336X1707200&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=subid_value&amp;url=https://steelseries.com/gaming-mousepads/qck-performance?size=l&amp;surface-type=Control">Large - $40 | XL - $50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Control surface used a micro-beaded texture to increase friction, which enables more precise movements and better stopping ability.
