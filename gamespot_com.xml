                <p>Tencent Games and developer Grey State Studio aren't sending players to Hell in their upcoming game, Rules of Engagement: The Grey State. But this free-to-play tactical-horror action-RPG shooter might be Hell-adjacent, thanks to a nightmarish realm filled with monsters and other unspeakable creatures.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Wow0CtP7ng" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5Wow0CtP7ng" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Grey State is the name of an unstable dimension that's too dangerous for humanity, but it also contains alien artifacts that are invaluable. To survive in this hellscape, players assume the role of Striders who remotely pilot their bio-engineered shells from the comfort of their own dimension. Grey State Studios describes The Grey State as a "graveyard of nightmares" and a "Horrorverse" that includes Lovecraftian creatures, as well as monsters inspired by films, books, and even creepypasta online tales.</p><p>The gameplay is a PvEvP loop that gives players only a limited time to drop into The Grey State. Striders will have to scavenge for gear inside the nightmarish dimension and ultimately choose between accepting an early extraction for limited rewards or taking a shot at even bigger profits if they can beat their fellow players to an alien artifact.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YZqXXxPn4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2YZqXXxPn4U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Grey State Studios is planning an alpha test for Rules of Engagement that will feature four classes of Striders that players can pick. The fourth option is currently being hidden, but the other three are listed below.</p><ul><li>Sledge, an unstoppable juggernaut that forges a path with shield and hammer</li><li>Pyro, a chaotic madman that controls the battlefield with fire and gas</li><li>Phantom, a swift assassin that strikes from the shadows with extreme precision</li></ul><p>The studio notes that players who demonstrate talent for buildcrafting and strategy will reap the rewards in this game. It also added that "Rules of Engagement was built with the future in mind, and we plan to support the game for years to come with content updates, meta shakeups and player-friendly free-to-play business model supported by a cosmetics-only in-game shop."</p><p>Rules of Engagement: The Grey State will hit PC in 2026, and it can be played as a single-player experience or with up to three other players. Additional seasonal content is planned post-launch to explore other aspects of the game's Horrorverse.</p>

<section><p>Skate's huge launch paints a hopeful picture, but the once dominating genre still has a ways to go</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">Maybe you've noticed, but everywhere you look now, skating is back.</p><p dir="ltr">Though skateboarding games once dominated the gaming scene in the 2000s, the well appeared to all but dry up as the ambitions of the games industry evolved through the decades. Recently, however, there's been a resurgence of skating games, and an audience made up of both oldheads and fresh-faced players alike has been showing up for them. It feels safe to say there's still an appetite for these kinds of titles. With the early-access release of EA's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/">Skate</a>--a revival of a series that once took up a lot of space in this industry--as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/">acclaimed</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">releases</a> of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remakes, the once-dying genre seems primed for a comeback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I first clocked this resurgence a while ago while playing an entirely different kind of skate game: a remarkably chill longboarding game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2223700/Driftwood/" rel="nofollow ">Driftwood</a>. In Driftwood, you take on the role of a pretty cool sloth who carves and bombs--in skating parlance, to "bomb" means to ride down a huge hill--<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLvW64MuvO4">picturesque mountainsides</a>. As a guy who longboarded back in high school and primarily cruised through the city, Driftwood brought me back to what first turned me onto skating--the rush of wind in my admittedly unprotected hair as I barreled down derelict roads and hills, and the satisfying (not to mention casual) coolness I'd feel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A42mHv2pqsY">swerving through throngs of walkers and traffic</a>. It feels suiting, then, that the game that reminded me why I loved skating also opened my eyes to just how many skating games had emerged in the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">For years now, developers have been producing a remarkable spectrum of titles, from the outlandish SkateBird to simulators like the aptly named Session: Skating Sim. SkaterXL came around a number of years ago, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk landed with all the noise and aplomb of Hawk's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YYTNkAdDD8">first successful 900</a>--and has a sequel on the way--and all the while, the OlliOlli games grew in size, substance, and style with every new release right up until Roll7's unfortunate closure.</p><p dir="ltr">There's been no shortage of skating games keeping the dream to shred alive, but with Skate's return, it feels like all the sectors of games development--the indie, AA, and AAA space, to be clear--are fully in the throes of a skating game renaissance.</p><p dir="ltr">So why exactly is this the moment for these kinds of games to re-emerge? What about the gaming landscape of 2025, and the last few years preceding it, has made developers choose to revisit this part of gaming's past?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585335"></a><figcaption>A sloth skates downhill in Driftwood</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585335-ss_62d5d8d0e98f490018e47ea0ad2bd56370da496f.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">According to Jason Mann, one of the developers who worked on Driftwood, the answer's pretty simple. "If I had to guess, it's probably that the people who grew up with the Skate and Tony Hawk series are getting old enough to make their own games, or at least have a bigger sway on consumer spending." Considering the timing, he's not exactly wrong. The Tony Hawk games first began appearing on the market back in the late '90s and the Skate series began about a decade after them. The average kid who played either is likely in a position to work in the industry and do something about their conspicuous hiatuses, the result of which we're seeing now. Given the industry's penchant for nostalgia and revisiting the touchstones of its past, this seems like the safest bet.</p><p dir="ltr">By and large, I agree with this opinion. But while I find the resurgence of skating games a welcome one, it also feels a bit like a tactical retreat at times. Maybe it's just the cynic in me, but when surveying the state of the games industry, one has to wonder: What works anymore? At a time when the field is fraught with layoffs and cancellations, it feels natural to see a reflexive nostalgia for the games that developers grew up with--games with legacies defined by their massive success and staying power. It makes ample sense then for something like Skate, which reshapes a beloved property into a new live-service model, to exist--even if it leaves audiences trepidatious.</p><p dir="ltr">For Jeffrey Spicer, a producer at crea-ture Studios who works on Session, the resurgence is reflective of skating culture's own highs and lows in popularity. Spicer added, however, that regardless of mainstream appeal, "there is always a core group of individuals that want a game that allows them the freedom and expression presented in real-life skating." It's a tough sentiment to deny when so many different skating games have cropped up over the years--a diversity that both he and Mann happily championed. It's especially fun seeing skate mechanics crop up in less-likely places too, like Thirsty Suitors from Outerloop Games back in 2023, the recently released Sword of the Sea (which seems more equivalent to surfing but we'll still take it!), and even last year's GameSpot GOTY, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Amusingly, the latter two of these titles allow players to ride on a sword. If I had a nickel for every time that happened, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585336"></a><figcaption>Metaphor: ReFantazio's protagonist skates through Grandtrad on his sword.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4585336-scmwmu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Spicer, this sort of looming spectre of skating is likely because "the desire for skating games [has] never truly dwindled." Mann echoed this thought, pointing to how previous Tony Hawk and Skate games have enjoyed "cult followings that appear to get quite some social media engagement." And how many of us haven't seen some wildly popular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/p2nAAD5zous">shortform video</a> of a player hitting an unbelievable Christ Air in Skate 3 set to Pearl Jam's "Even Flow."</p><p dir="ltr">Still, the uptick in skating games and their popularity is becoming palpable, which Spicer attributes to "the growing playerbase" and their demand for more. Fortunately, this moment feels ripe for someone who might want to get into them and clearly there is a desire. Mat Piscatella, a senior director and analyst at the market research company Circana, confirmed that Skate's release for EA seemed to be off to a "phenomenal start." Evidently, the free-to-play revival of the series "ranked among the top 5 titles in weekly total actives" over the majority of the platforms for which numbers are reported, putting its starting audience on par with the likes of giants like Fortnite and Grand Theft Auto. While it is typical of tentpole releases to see huge numbers out the door, it's a little rarer to see the feat accomplished by a title belonging to a once popular niche in a series that hasn't released a game in 15 years, making Skate's debut a refreshing shock to the system.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of their once dominating presence, Piscatella also shared that when he worked at Activision, "Tony Hawk games were what games like Call of Duty and Madden are today: annualized releases with a loyal audience that would buy the new version every year." The challenge now, as Piscatella puts it, is to turn these "pulses," instances where a sporadic major release spiked interest and sales in skating games, into a flashpoint that translates to more staying power. Maybe Skate can manage that feat, but folks like Mann would also welcome more original games from the genre's other big series, as well as skating games with "full-fledged story modes" and a bit more grit.</p><p dir="ltr">No matter what form or shape it takes, the devs I spoke to seemed enthusiastic. Not just about the mainstream moment skating games are once again having, but at the prospect of their own work keeping a "torch lit for future generations to find skating," per Spicer.</p><p dir="ltr">"Be it getting new kids on their first board or getting old skaters to dust off their set ups, skating is for everyone."</p>

This deal is specifically for the digital edition; once you buy a code from either retailer, you can redeem it on the Nintendo eShop. Both retailers are also offering steep discounts on the digital edition of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></strong> and the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenoblade-Chronicles-Expansion-Nintendo-Digital/dp/B077PC6D3Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Expansion Pass</a></strong>, which comes with the lengthy standalone sequel Torna - The Golden Country.

From a story perspective, the Xenoblade Chronicles Trilogy is one of the best modern series in the genre.</p><p>The Definitive Edition earned a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review/1900-6417470/" data-ref-id="1900-6417470">Xenoblade Chronicles review</a>. </p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Xenoblade Chronicles 2 (Digital)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077PJ65T6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$41.88 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Xenoblade Chronicles 2 launched in 2017 as the Nintendo Switch's first major RPG exclusive. While it's not as highly regarded as the original, it's still one of the better role-playing games on Switch (and Switch 2). While you don't technically <em>need </em>to play the first game to enjoy Xenoblade 2, it's highly recommended you play each game in chronological order to experience the full weight of the trilogy's overarching story.</p><p>The sequel has some pacing and narrative issues, but the combat system remains awesome, and the expansive world is a joy to explore. Xenoblade 2 starts quite slow, but the back half of the 60-plus hour campaign is thrilling.

US editions of Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and Torna - The Golden Country often sell for above retail price, but you can often get these and other Xenoblade games for less by opting for region-free imports from the UK. Regardless of region, getting physical editions of the Xenoblade trilogy often means buying from third-party resellers. The physical editions listed above are from resellers but are fulfilled by Amazon or Walmart.</p><p>The best physical edition deal at the moment is for <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DLK17ZY5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a></strong>, the enhanced port of the 2015 Wii U spin-off. The stellar Switch version of Xenoblade Chronicles X launched in March and is available for $52.50 (was $60) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DLK17ZY5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Two+Xenoblade+Chronicles+Games+Get+Rare+Discounts+At+Amazon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-14+14%3A57%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-14+14%3A57%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6535432&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXenoblade-Chronicles-X-Definitive-Edition%2F13948068388%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals%2F1100-6535432%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, which is close to the all-time low ($50). Xenoblade Chronicles X is more action-oriented than the main trilogy and can be fully enjoyed without prior knowledge of the series.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you buy an international edition of Xenoblade 2, it will only be compatible with the Expansion Pass from the European eShop. This doesn't apply to the standalone edition of Torna - The Golden Country since it's considered a separate game. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 also has an Expansion Pass that must match the region of your physical or digital copy.</p><hr><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals/1100-6535432/">Two Xenoblade Chronicles Games Get Rare Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-by-alan-lee-deluxe-book-box-set-amazon-walmart-deals/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Box Set Is Still On Sale For Only $108</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Guide - Target Reveals Exclusive Launch Bonus</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/creepshow-complete-series-blu-ray-preorder-is-nearly-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6526479/">Creepshow: Complete Series Blu-Ray Preorders Are Nearly 50% Off At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-edition-is-available-now-for-40/1100-6535099/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Edition Is Available Now For $40</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-animated-series-blu-ray-release-preorder-amazon/1100-6535393/">Scott Pilgrim Animated Series Is Releasing On Blu-Ray, Preorders Restocked</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Collector Booster Box Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-minecraft-crafting-table-creeper-best-amazon-deals/1100-6535384/">Lego Minecraft 15th Anniversary Diorama And Creeper Figure Get First Big Discounts</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Electronic Arts has not announced any official sales data for Battlefield 6, but one report from an analyst claims the game may have approached a Call of Duty-sized launch with 6.5 million copies sold in its first few days.</p><p><a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/battlefield-6-is-a-smash-hit-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics wrote</a> that the game reached those sales numbers across all platforms, citing its own internal estimates. This would work to more than $350 million in gross revenue, according to Elliott.</p>

<p>"It's closer to Call of Duty-tier numbers than any of EA's premium-shooter efforts so far. But the question now is whether or not EA can foster this successful launch into a platform that stands the test of time," Elliott said.</p><p>The report also had a breakdown of sales by platform, with Steam accounting for 65.7% of sales, driving 3.5 million copies sold and more than $220 million in revenue. Next behind was PS5, which accounted for 1.5 million copies and made up 23.7% of total sales, the report said. Xbox Series X|S ranked third overall, with 1.2 million units sold and a 19.6% share.</p><p>On Steam specifically, Battlefield 6 is putting up big numbers, reaching a peak concurrent player record of more than 747,000. That's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/" data-ref-id="2900-6301">most concurrent players on Steam for any EA game</a>, even eclipsing the free-to-play Apex Legends (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172470/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">624k</a>).</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 launches on October 28</a>, which is also the day the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is rumored to launch</a>. Season 1 will continue with Phase 2, Rogue Ops, on November 18, followed by Winter Offensive on December 9. These updates will add new maps, modes, guns.</p><p>While Battlefield 6 may have had a hot start, it remains to be seen if it'll be able to, for the first time, outsell a Call of Duty game. Experts said prior to Battlefield 6's launch that they believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">that will not happen</a> and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will outrank EA's game. </p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">GameSpot's Battlefield 6 review</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/" data-ref-id="1100-6533950">Battlefield 6 guides hub.</a></p>

                <p>It's the Halloween season in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Call of Duty </a>and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> Fortnite</a>, and naturally, that means familiar faces are turning up in each game like they do every spooky season. In a rare move, there's one villainous slasher who is actually making his debut in both games this October: Jason Voorhees.</p><p>As the star of Friday the 13th, Jason is currently "between jobs," you could say, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-350279">Friday the 13th: The Game</a> was forced to end sooner than players or creators expected <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/friday-the-13th-the-game-being-delisted-and-shut-down/1100-6514944/" data-ref-id="1100-6514944">due to a legal snafu some years back</a>. Fans are clamoring for a new game starring Jason, and one is coming, Horror Inc. executive vice president Robbie Barsamian told GameSpot. Though the team doesn't have many specifics to share on that project as of now, I caught up with Barsamian to discuss the team's famous monster and his guest spots in other games this month.</p><p>With Fortnite's lighter tone and Call of Duty's emphasis on more mature themes, it's as though Jason were reimagined twice, with the towering killer giving fans two different sides of himself--and it's all wrapped up in the new Jason design helmed by Greg Nicotero of The Walking Dead fame.</p><p>Below you can read my interview with Barsamian on how the Jason Universe team worked with both teams to make Jason fit each world, how the new design came to be, and what's next for the slasher.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043" data-ratio="0.52333333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585043"></a><figcaption>Jason is pulling double duty, arriving in Fortnite and Call of Duty for Halloween 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585043-fortnitemaresjason.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the Greg Nicotero-designed Jason, at first glance, he looks quite faithful to the Jason who has persisted as my mental image of him for decades. What were some of the creative decisions that steered his design, and are there any nuances we should look more closely for that maybe we miss at first glance?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We drew inspiration from more classic versions of Jason from the ‘80s movies when we started working with Greg Nicotero. Jason is a strong, towering (over 6’5”!), and terrifying human that is one of the most iconic villains of all time, and we wanted our new design to reflect those classic elements to honor the legacy, while simultaneously refreshing his look for a new era of stories.</p><p dir="ltr">We also reimagined the eyes on the mask to make Jason look even more menacing, while reducing the number of holes in the mask to 13 as a fun nod.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Debuting in Call of Duty and Fortnite makes sense given how massive and crossover-friendly those games are, but fans will notice two very different versions of the slasher, with Call of Duty's naturally being more violent and graphic and Fortnite's being a bit sillier (like his canoeing emote). How did the various people involved seek to capture Jason's essence in two similar but importantly different ways?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We are thrilled Jason is stepping into both the Call of Duty and Fortnite worlds for the first time ever this Halloween! Our fans have been asking for these collabs for quite some time, so we’re glad we could deliver during our 45th anniversary celebration year.</p><p dir="ltr">We wanted to give players the ultimate Jason experience in each world, so we worked with both teams to ensure he’s still Jason, with his classic physicality and movements—he’s towering and moves with intention--as well as his weapons like the machete and axe. But we also wanted him to be appropriately reimagined for these worlds, which means he uses a gun (which he never does in our movies) and has his exclusive tactical combat skin in Call of Duty, plus fun emotes, back bling, and an overall non-bloody design in Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope players love playing as and against Jason in both games!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Jason Voorhees is a horror icon for most generations alive today, but I wonder how much younger people know him since he's been out of the spotlight for some time. Do you have any sense of how big Jason is with the--let's call it the TikTok generation? These collabs are naturally going to introduce him to </strong><em><strong>some</strong></em><strong> players. So what do you hope they see in him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Jason is a pop culture icon 45 years later and is recognized and beloved by generations. There are 5.5 BILLION views on TikTok of #Fridaythe13th and #F13 UGC videos, and 3.7 BILLION views of #JasonVoorhees UGC videos. The TikTok generation has come to love the same hockey-mask-wearing killer, just in different ways. For example, the 2017 Friday the 13th game had nearly 15 million players, and many of them found Jason for the first time through the game without ever having seen any of the original movies.</p><p dir="ltr">We hope the TikTok generation loves playing with Jason through these new crossovers and getting to know him better whether it’s through gaming, TV with Crystal Lake premiering on Peacock in the near future, movies, or immersive experiences like Halloween Horror Nights.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Does it feel difficult or strange to hand over Jason's usual aura in these games, where he will inevitably be seen doing things like silly dances and emotes? Is this something where you have to swallow your pride and not be so precious about the character, or is it easier now that players and creators have gotten so used to crossovers like this? Are you mentally prepared to see Jason wearing Jordans and singing Chappell Roan? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’re excited to see how players in both collabs make Jason their own. In terms of the base Jason design, we made sure to stay true to classic Jason elements, but we know players want to have fun--especially since it’s the first time Jason has entered into this sort of gaming environment. When Jason is in his own world and projects, we are of course committed to giving fans and players a more authentic experience centered around his Camp Crystal Lake legacy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044" data-ratio="0.55886102847429" data-width="2353" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585044"></a><figcaption>In both games, Jason is one of several famous horror faces joining the fray.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585044-callofduty_thehauntingkeyart.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>A good example of reimagining the character for the platform is Jason's tactical outfit in Call of Duty. What's the creative process look like when the Jason Universe team and Call of Duty team are going for such a specific crossover like that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We loved the tactical outfit from the initial sketch the COD team shared with us! We maintained Jason’s body and mask design and overlaid the tactical outfit along with the recolored mask. Adding the machete strapped to his back was a fun nod to classic Jason. Both teams were striving to keep Jason’s essence while considering what he would look like in a way that was more native to the COD world, and I think we nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When designing gameplay elements like the Slasher mode in Call of Duty or presenting Jason as a boss NPC in Fortnite, what specific moments or movies did you look to for inspiration?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We didn’t look to specific moments or movies as much as we aimed to make sure Jason’s core essence was fully realized. Jason is such a force in the movies, so it was important that he truly feels like one in the games too. Both Slasher Deathmatch and the Jason boss NPC in Fortnite really convey that Jason is a force of nature, in a way that feels distinct and natural to the gameplay of each title.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I was 14 when I excitedly went to the midnight showing of Freddy vs. Jason, and it was probably the coolest thing I'd ever seen to that point in my life as a huge horror fan. Nowadays, Fortnite and Call of Duty sort of offer a version of horror mashups in every match, with Jason joining so many other crossovers from Hollywood's slashers and monsters. What are your thoughts on seeing fans bring them together in this way?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">That’s awesome to hear! As you mention, Jason obviously has that history of crossing paths with a character like Freddy, but they do operate in the shared realm or genre of horror and slashers. These new collabs open things up so much more, allowing Jason to interact with characters in ways that would never happen in an official setting like a movie, giving fans of all backgrounds a way to live out their dreams.

                <p dir="ltr">At Tokyo Game Show last month, Capcom announced a new approach to both the Capcom Cup and Street Fighter League esports tournaments with a new pay-per-view model. After a furious response to the move by the fighting game community, Capcom now says it will be taking the change into further consideration.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-are-reviewing-pricing-capcom-responds-to-fan-backlash-after-decision-to-charge-40-to-watch-tournament-final-streams/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a new statement from Capcom regarding the events says that the company is "reviewing pricing and related details," with "updated information regarding the PPV broadcast, including final pricing and additional context" set to be shared "next month."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CapcomFighters/status/1976541576060158429" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Starting October 10th at 2:00 AM PDT, fans can enter the lottery to purchase tickets to attend CAPCOM CUP 12 and the Street Fighter League: World Championship 2025 in person, both taking place at Ryogoku Kokugikan in Tokyo.<br>Details: <a href="https://t.co/OGXwEWbCyz" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/OGXwEWbCyz</a></p><p> At Tokyo Game Show on…</p></div>  — Capcom Fighters (@CapcomFighters) <a href="https://twitter.com/CapcomFighters/status/1976541576060158429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The <a href="https://x.com/CapcomFighters/status/1972201157172089089" rel="nofollow ">Tokyo Game Show announcement</a> laid out Capcom's plans for the new PPV model, setting the price for both the Capcom Cup finals livestream on March 14, as well as the Street Fighter League finals the next day, at 4,000 yen each--or roughly $27 a pop.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, is taking the nuclear option when it comes to eliminating combat add-ons, after years of Blizzard discussing how they posed problems for the health of the game. It's a bold approach, but, unfortunately, one that has been communicated incredibly poorly and seems to be taking unnecessary risks that could potentially make the game worse, not better, in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">Until the recent arrival of Midnight's alpha build, it wasn't exactly clear how far-reaching Blizzard's approach would be. While non-combat add-ons (WoW's version of player-made mods) aren't being touched, it was known some major changes would be coming to how combat add-ons work in Midnight. Those changes would come in conjunction with Blizzard introducing its own version of popular add-on functions, like boss timers and damage meters, alongside improvements to recently implemented features like the cooldown manager and combat assistant. Blizzard also said it's designing combat encounters going forward so that (hopefully) combat add-ons wouldn't be as necessary as before.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That all sounded great on paper. Many assumed some of these changes would come over time, allowing for a period where both add-ons and Blizzard's own UI updates could work in conjunction or until certain parts of the base-game UI meant to replicate add-on functionality was ready. Blizzard has instead opted to rip off the proverbial band-aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Midnight alpha, nearly every piece of combat information is rendered invisible to add-ons and thus can't be computed or read to give players more information. That includes things as simple as how much health a player or enemy has, what abilities enemies are using, reading chat messages during combat, or whether there's a puddle of fire on the ground you should probably move out of. Combat add-ons may still work technically come Midnight, but they will require a ton of tweaks by creators and their functionality will likely be so much worse than the game's base UI (much of which still needs improvement) that there won't be much use for them.</p><p dir="ltr">The result has blindsided combat add-on developers and left them scrambling. The folks behind one of WoW's longest-running and most-popular add-ons, WeakAuras, have stated that unless Blizzard makes major changes to its approach, they won't be making a version for Midnight. In a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weakauras-x-140349416?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" rel="nofollow ">statement</a>, the WeakAuras team said Blizzard downplayed the scope and timing of its add-on approach in past statements, and that the current approach "does not leave us with much choice other than closing shop." Meanwhile, the creators of Deadly Boss Mods, WoW's most-popular add-on that has been downloaded more than 571 million times according to Curse Forge, have <a href="https://x.com/deadlybossmods?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> the add-on isn't going anywhere but will be changing alongside WoW itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll just say it upfront: I don't like combat add-ons. I've played WoW for nearly two decades, and in that time I've always viewed them as a necessary evil. Whereas some players love spending hours making their own custom UIs and enabling WeakAuras to track their buffs and cooldowns, I've largely opted to instead stick with the default UI, finding the entire add-on process tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of this is because despite having played for the better part of 20 years, I have no real interest (or time) to participate in high-level Mythic+ dungeons or Mythic raiding, and thus have never viewed combat add-ons as essential as many top players do. I've also just never been a fan of the idea that I have to go to a third-party site and download something like Deadly Boss Mods, which up until this point has basically been viewed as mandatory for even casual WoW players, in order to play the game properly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is overhauling WoW's old Blood Elf zones as part of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combat add-ons have always offered a major advantage to those who opted to use them compared to those who don't. This has always been a failure on Blizzard's part for allowing the add-on arms race between mod creators and the development team to go on for as long as it has. The same is true for designing WoW in a way that such add-ons felt like they had become necessary due to players not having all the information they needed to be successful.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard eliminating the need for combat add-ons is undoubtedly a good thing for WoW's long-term health, and something I'm not particularly upset about. I believe there are plenty of others who feel the same way. When combined with Blizzard's built-in UI updates and proposed changes to make combat more streamlined, WoW will soon be more approachable than ever before. It could also pave the way for WoW to be ported to consoles, exposing even more players to Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">genre-defining MMORPG</a>. All of that is good.</p><p dir="ltr">There's only one issue: Blizzard's entire approach. By gutting combat add-ons immediately upon the start of Midnight, Blizzard is backing itself into an unnecessary corner. All of Blizzard's plans revolve around it actually being able to deliver all these features in time for the expansion's launch. If it can't replace all that add-on functionality on day-one, players are left with a worse version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are some features that are already ready from primetime, like the new nameplates, boss alerts, and the cooldown manager, there's plenty still missing. Damage meters and updated raid frames are huge pieces of the puzzle that aren't available for testing, and it's unclear when they will be. Raid frames in particular are huge for healers, who often use raid frame add-ons like VuhDo in order to be able to track their outgoing heals, priority debuffs, and more. Raid frame add-ons will still exist come Midnight, but they won't be able to track combat data as they currently do, a huge nerf to healers.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does plan to offer some solutions here, but it's unlikely Blizzard's in-game versions will be as robust, customizable, or feature-rich as what many add-on users are accustomed to. That applies to just about every add-on Blizzard is looking to replace. Many of these add-ons have been updated and improved for over a decade. It's unreasonable to assume that Blizzard's versions will be at that same level right out the gate, assuming they are there at launch at all.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of Blizzard's plan also depends on its own encounter design. Until we see more of what Midnight's top-end raid boss encounters look like, it's impossible to say whether Blizzard has designed an endgame with no combat add-ons needed. WoW's Mythic difficulty encounters have been designed in a certain way for years, facilitating the need for combat add-ons in the first place. Having all that change in a single expansion requires a lot of trust in Blizzard to stick the landing, and I don't think players can be blamed for not entirely believing in its ability to execute.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914" data-ratio="0.56238244514107" data-width="1595" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is aiming to design Midnight's endgame to not require combat add-ons in order to succeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for those unforeseen consequences I mentioned earlier, Blizzard's all-or-nothing approach is unfairly cruel to one particular portion of the WoW community: disabled players. These players can make extensive use of combat add-ons in order to play WoW, whether casually or at a high-level, as is the case with <a href="https://undauntedguild.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow ">Undaunted</a>, a well-known competitive WoW raiding guild for deaf and hard-of-hearing players. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ny1lg7/accessibility_impact_of_the_recent_addon_changes/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>, Undaunted guild leader Saormash wrote an extensive breakdown of just how damaging losing "20 years of accessibility" is to the game's disabled community. Saormash said WoW has long been a leader when it comes to gaming accessibility thanks to the game's community of add-on creators. If Blizzard doesn't walk back some of its approach, that's due to all be tossed out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will be completely locked out of progression due to something that is completely beyond our control," Saormash said. "In the past, we could turn to add-on and WeakAura creators for help. Without that benefit, we may see less tolerance from the raiding community for disabled players. Nobody will want to have their raid progress stalled by one person's inability to successfully pass a mechanic check."</p><p dir="ltr">Without the extensive ability to customize and tweak combat add-ons to meet their needs, these players will be left in the dust come Midnight without many new features being added to the game. Blizzard's UI design team simply cannot compete with the thousands of add-on creators who have created tools and solutions for players of all sorts for decades. As Saormash explained, despite the game's disabled community being the most negatively affected by the combat add-on apocalypse, it feels "unseen and unheard" by not being given the opportunity to provide direct feedback to Blizzard. It's unclear how long it will take Blizzard to implement the kinds of changes and features currently filled by WeakAuras and other add-ons that make the game playable for WoW's disabled community. Any answer longer than "immediately at launch" just isn't acceptable and reason alone to pump the brakes on this entire combat add-on crusade.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, at least, some indication Blizzard is listening. It's already walked back some combat add-on restrictions based on feedback. In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-director-admits-its-too-hard-without-combat-mods-and-explains-how-bosses-will-change-in-midnight-were-not-looking-to-turn-all-our-raid-encounters-into-giant-puzzles-for-people-to-solve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> interview, WoW senior game director Ion Hazzikostas said it has now invited members of Undaunted into the Midnight testing program to receive their feedback, and that "accessibility remains a top focus for the team." Midnight also won't be launching until sometime in early 2026, giving Blizzard, at minimum, three or so months to listen, respond, and iterate on its plans. I have no doubt bigger changes to what is and isn't allowed in terms of combat add-ons will be coming in the weeks and months ahead, as well as more details about what players can expect from the game's updated raid frames and other UI improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">None of that, however, changes the fact that these are all problems entirely of Blizzard's own making. Not only were Blizzard's intentions and plans poorly communicated, but its choice to take the all-or-nothing approach to combat add-ons, without more closely involving the game's community beforehand, has resulted in confusion and frustration from some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's overall goal here is admirable, and one that many players will likely agree with. Fast forward one, two, or five years and WoW might be the best it's ever been, with no need for combat add-ons, approachable endgame encounters, and all the accessibility features it needs to serve its community. But Blizzard is putting the cart before the horse. That future, idyllic version of WoW is not now, and given how Blizzard has handled this entire situation thus far, it might not be here in time for Midnight's launch either.</p>

                <p>One of the year's best indie games, Blue Prince, is getting an official <strong>physical PS5 release on November 21</strong>. Until now, it was only available digitally on consoles and PC, but fans can now preorder this new PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue Prince physical edition</a> for just $35 at Amazon. While the digital version of the game is also available on Xbox Series X and PC, PS5 is the only confirmed physical version--which isn't surprising, since that seems to be the case with most physical indie game releases these days. Along with the base game, physical copies will include an exclusive poster. Preordering also gets you a digital version of the game's soundtrack. It's probably wise to grab an early copy soon if you're interested--preorders for the Blue Prince PS5 edition initially went live about a month ago, and the first wave quickly sold out, so there's a chance this could disappear again soon.</p><h2>Blue Prince Physical Edition Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983"></a><figcaption>Blue Prince preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg"></figure><p>Preordering Blue Prince physical edition gets you the Blue Prince: Day One Edition, which includes an exclusive download code for a digital copy of the game's official soundtrack.</p><div title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4687" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Blue Prince (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$35 | Releases November 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Blue Prince PS5 release includes the full game on disc and an 18 x 12 inch fold-out poster featuring Mount Holly Manor, plus the digital soundtrack if you preorder the Day One Edition.

"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had," wrote critic Steve Watts. "It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric.
