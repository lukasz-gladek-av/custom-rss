                <p>It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn't sold as well as 2024's Black Ops 6</a>, and now Circana has released more sales data that speaks to the performance of the military shooter.</p><p>Black Ops 7 was the No. 1 best-selling game in North America for November, but the Call of Duty franchise experienced a double-digit percent decrease for full-game dollar sales compared to November 2024. Last year's game, Black Ops 6, was released in October. Despite the sales downturn, this marks the 18th straight year that a new Call of Duty game has ranked No. 1 for its launch month. For anyone keeping score, that streak began with 2008's Call of Duty: World at War.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is now the No. 7 best-selling game of 2025 so far, with EA's Battlefield 6 continuing to rank No. 1 for the year. For November, Black Ops 7 was No. 1, followed by Battlefield 6, NBA 2K26, Madden NFL 26, and EA Sports FC 26 rounding out the top five for the month.</p><p>The Circana report doesn't tell the whole story of Black Ops 7's sales performance, as the company only tracks sales in North America. Additionally, Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, which eats into full-game sales. For 2024's Black Ops 6, a report estimated that Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">lost out on $300 million in revenue due to Game Pass.</a></p><p>Microsoft no doubt also saw upside, too, though, with new sign-ups for Game Pass and engagement. To that end, Call of Duty--as a collective franchise spanning multiple titles--will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">finish 2025 as the No. 1 franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a></p><p>It is rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-modern-warfare-4-rumors-cod-dev-says-not-to-believe-everything-on-the-internet/1100-6537000/" data-ref-id="1100-6537000">2026's new Call of Duty game is Modern Warfare 4 from developer Infinity Ward</a>, though this is not confirmed.</p>

                <p>Circana released its monthly sales report for November today, shining a light on how the North American video game business is performing. Hardware sales had a particularly difficult month, with sales falling 27%, from $949 million in November 2024 to $695 million in November 2025.</p><p>November 2025 represented the lowest hardware spending total for a November month since November 2005 ($455 million). A total of 1.6 million game hardware units were sold in North America for November 2025, and that's the lowest since November 1995 (1.4 million units).</p><p>While total unit sales dropped, the average price paid for a new game console reached a new record high for a November month, rising to $439, up 11% compared to November 2024. The higher average selling price is connected to the price increases that companies like Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and others have implemented this year due to tariffs and other factors.</p><p>For November 2025, Sony's PS5 ranked No. 1 for both unit sales and dollar sales--it's the first time the PS5 is back on top since the Switch 2 came out in June. The Switch 2, meanwhile, landed at No. 2 for unit and dollar sales in November 2025, with the Nex Playground coming in third for hardware units sold. Xbox Series X|S ranked No. 3 for dollar sales in November 2025.</p><p>In terms of software sales for November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/" data-ref-id="1100-6537040">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 ranked No. 1 for the month</a>, extending Call of Duty's streak to 18 years in a row where the franchise has debuted in the top spot for its release month. However, Call of Duty franchise sales experienced double-digit declines.</p><p>For 2025 so far, EA's Battlefield 6 is still the year's best-selling game in North America.</p>
