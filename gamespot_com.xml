                <p>In 2021, Marvel Studios attempted to expand the reach of the MCU with an adaptation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-eternals-review-a-gorgeous-experiment/1900-6417768/" data-ref-id="1900-6417768">Eternals</a>, a lesser-known group of immortal heroes. Kumail Nanjiani was cast as Kingo alongside Angelina Jolie, Gemma Chan, Salma Hayek, Barry Keoghan, and more. Eternals didn't earn enough to merit a sequel, and Nanjiani has revealed that he had a deal for a video game and a theme park attraction that never came to pass.</p><p>"I signed on for six movies, you know," said Nanjiani during his appearance on Mike Birbiglia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=Y8zwAj3sYpc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Working It Out</a> podcast. "I signed on for a video game. I signed on for a theme park ride. They make you sign up for all this stuff ... And so you're like, 'Oh, this is the next 10 years of my life, so I'll be doing Marvel movies every year, and then in-between I'll do like my own little things, whatever I want to do.' And then none of that happened."</p><p>That deal appears to have been predicated on Eternals being a hit like Guardians of the Galaxy before it, which did get licensed out for video games and theme park rides. Marvel hasn't had a lot of video games based directly on the MCU movies in the last two decades, but the studio apparently kept the possibility open for Eternals.</p><p>Nanjiani previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-eternals-star-kumail-nanjiani-went-to-therapy-after-bad-reviews/1100-6520870/" data-ref-id="1100-6520870">disclosed that he went to therapy</a> after Eternals was greeted with bad reviews, but he told Birbiglia that the experience taught him that too much of his self esteem was tied up to other people's reactions to his work.</p><p>Eternals had $402.1 million worldwide, which is a threshold that Marvel Studios has had trouble reaching this year. Regardless, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-america-brave-new-world-brings-adamantium-finally-references-eternals/1100-6525358/" data-ref-id="1100-6525358">the only Marvel movie to pick up on some of the threads introduced in Eternals</a> was Captain America: Brave New World.</p><p>Nanjiani also noted that he's proud of Eternals, and his experience with it has given him material for his latest standup comedy set.</p>

                <p>Activision has made a key announcement about the Carry Forward program for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and that is that <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it's no longer happening</a>.</p><p>"Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 will no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7," Activision said. "Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7."</p><p>"This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there."</p><p>Activision said double XP tokens and GobbleGums will continue to carry forward. "Because we recognize your time and progression are important," the developer explained.</p><p>Only a week ago, Activision said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-carry-forward-returns-for-black-ops-7-but-with-limitations/1100-6534013/" data-ref-id="1100-6534013">the Carry Forward program would return for Black Ops 7</a>, but not until some time after Season 1.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While details on Skate remained under wraps during its early development period, the last year has seen a trickle of new information released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/">and at least one memorable promo</a> featuring skateboarder and I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson. What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/">Skate will be an always-online game</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-somehow-has-microtransactions-before-it-even-hits-early-access-report/1100-6530068/">supported by microtransactions</a>, and in terms of gameplay, players can pull off some impressive tricks using the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-dev-explains-new-flick-it-system-and-its-ever-changing-city/1100-6524008/">redesigned Flick-it system</a>. The game will also feature a new approach to soundtracks and lots of customization options.</p><p>Skate is kick-flipping its way back into gaming at a time when skateboarding games have experienced a resurgence. Over the last couple of years, we've seen spiritual successors to Skate like Skater XL and Session: Skate Sim, while the franchise's biggest rival, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">returned this year with a remake of the THPS 3 and 4 games</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we've also seen several well-received projects from the indie side of game development--like the OlliOlli series from the now-shuttered Roll7 and The Ramp--help to herald in the current era of skateboarding games.</p>

                <p>Every item in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/">Peak</a> serves an important purpose. Some are vital survival tools, aiding your injuries or keeping your tummy full to keep you climbing for longer. Others can jeopardize an entire expedition in an instant. Depending on who you're playing with, the latter can be dangerous--there's always that one player who won't hesitate to create a TikTok-worthy moment.</p><p>Here's the trick with items in Peak: While the game tells you its name, it doesn't actually explain what an item does. Some are easy enough to guess from looks alone, but more often than not, you should be wary of using something to avoid being penalized or affecting the run by accident. Don't fret, though--if you're wondering what things like the <strong>strange gem</strong> or the <strong>crystal skull</strong> do, the list below includes <strong>every item in Peak and what they do</strong>, so you can have a helpful page at hand to dispel doubts in the group chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843"></a><figcaption>I'm sorry, Bing Bong.

There have been quite a few smaller patches, but by and large, here are all the items available thus far. Note that we're skipping most of the food, as their purpose is largely self-explanatory.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Item</th><th scope="col">What it does</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ancient Effigy</td><td>Revives any dead player or players.</td></tr><tr><td>Ancient Idol</td><td>You gain invulnerability to everything... as long as you hold it, that is.</td></tr><tr><td>Antidote</td><td>Cures poison partially</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Cannon</td><td>When shot at a surface, it releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead, starting from the point of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Spool</td><td>It releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Backpack</td><td>It can carry up to four items</td></tr><tr><td>Bandages</td><td>Restores health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>Berrynana</td><td>You can throw it on the ground to cause other people to fall.</td></tr><tr><td>Big Lollipop</td><td>Grants infinite stamina for about seven seconds, and inflicts the drowsy status immediately after.</td></tr><tr><td>Bing Bong</td><td>Basically just a cute plushie, and part of a tough achievement that involves finishing a run while carrying it, in a similar fashion to Gnome Chompski in Left 4 Dead 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Binoculars</td><td>No abnormal effect here. They're just binoculars.</td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>Shoots a dart that clears negative status except for the curse status. The player who receives the shot will be temporarily drowsy.</td></tr><tr><td>Bounce Fungus</td><td>Creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, making for a good spot to rest while climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle</td><td>Plays a song, or heinous sounds, depending on your taste. If you use it around the capybaras in Alpine, you'll get an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle of Friendship</td><td>Boosts everybody's stamina momentarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Cactus</td><td>It does nothing, but beware of its thorns if you throw it around.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain Launcher</td><td>Shoots a chain to the spot you're aiming at. Be mindful of your current stamina before committing to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>Points north, which matches the peak of the mountain.</td></tr><tr><td>Conch</td><td>It does nothing. You can throw it at your friends if you want, though.</td></tr><tr><td>Cure-All</td><td>Cures all negative statuses.</td></tr><tr><td>Cursed Skull</td><td>Heals allies at the expense of your own health.</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamite</td><td>Causes an explosion, which can also cook items.</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Drink</td><td>Increases speed momentarily while inflicting the drowsy status afterward.</td></tr><tr><td>Faerie Lantern</td><td>Gets rid of all negative statuses. It doesn't help with hunger.</td></tr><tr><td>First Aid Kit</td><td>If injured, it restores all of your health, while also curing poison.</td></tr><tr><td>Flare</td><td>This emits a big smoke cloud that alerts others of your location. It's also used at the peak to call the helicopter.</td></tr><tr><td>Flying Disk</td><td>You can just have some fun with this.</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Pack</td><td>When used, it gradually removes cold for some time. Useful for blizzards in the Alpine biome.</td></tr><tr><td>Lantern</td><td>Emits light, and its heat also removes cold gradually.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Bean</td><td>It summons a beanstalk, which is great for climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandora's Lunchbox</td><td>It removes all negative effects upon use, but you also get a random assortment of new effects, which can be either positive or negative. Thanks, Pandora.</td></tr><tr><td>Parasol</td><td>Along with protecting you from the sun, you can use it for gliding.</td></tr><tr><td>Pirate's Compass</td><td>Points toward suitcases nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>Piton</td><td>Adds a piton on any suitable surface that you can grab onto to restore stamina.</td></tr><tr><td>Portable Stove</td><td>Useful for cooking items and reducing cold.</td></tr><tr><td>Remedy Fungus</td><td>It creates a healing mist when thrown against the ground. If you're playing with others, make sure you're all gathered together first.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Cannon</td><td>Shoots a harpoon to where you're aiming, which releases a rope in the place of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Spool</td><td>Releases a rope. You can adjust the height and, once ready, press the action button again to anchor it to the surface you're standing on so it stays in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Torch</td><td>A great source of light, albeit limited.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Cannon</td><td>You can shoot yourself from a long distance with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Efficy</td><td>Revives another player. If more than one player is dead, the item picks one at random.</td></tr><tr><td>Scoutmaster's Bugle</td><td>If you're playing solo, using this rare bugle summons the Scoutmaster. Useful for an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Scroll</td><td>There's a chance of seeing them at the summit of biomes. You can use them to create Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Shelf Fungus</td><td>It creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, great for climbing or to provide an extra platform when attempting long jumps.</td></tr><tr><td>Strange Gem</td><td>It does nothing. At least for now.</td></tr><tr><td>Torn Page</td><td>Mostly for an achievement, which tasks you with collecting eight Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Weird Shroom</td><td>No weird side effects, it just restores your health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>More to come at some point</td><td>There'll likely be more items added in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's all the items available in Peak at the time of writing. Have fun climbing!</p>
