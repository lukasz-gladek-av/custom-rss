In Dawnshore, you can purchase a treasure map from Sanza's Emporium for 100 Gold, <strong>Wodeica's Inheritance</strong>, which leads to the Gloves of the Strangler, a unique set of gloves. Sanza' Emporium is a ship found in Northern Paradis, which is considered a separate region from the main part of the city and is accessed via the main quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Woedica's Inheritance</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441402"></a><figcaption>Woedica's Inheritance can be found outside the eastern wall of Paradis.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg"></figure><p>To find Woedica's Inheritance, you should start at the Eastern Paradis Gate Beacon fast travel point.

                <p>One of the earlier side quests you can take on in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is called "Mapping the Living Lands." You accept this quest from Sanza in Paradis once you get through the first couple of story missions. Sanza employs a cartographer named Geirmund who has gone missing somewhere in Dawnshore and he tasks you with finding him, or whatever is left of him.</p><p>Unfortunately, unlike other side quests in Avowed, Mapping the Living Lands gives you no quest marker on the map, so you have little idea of where to look for the cartographer. While you can stumble about for a bit trying to find Geirmund on your own, you can also look at the guide below to make things far easier on yourself.</p><h2>Dawnshore Cartographer's location in Avowed</h2><p>The only piece of information Sanza gives you about Geirmund's location is to the east of Paradis near a cave. While that might be helpful if you've already explored a large chunk of Dawnshore, that vague description likely means nothing to you if your map is still mostly fogged out.</p><p>To make your trek simpler, you can see the general area of the Dawnshore Cartographer in the map screenshot below:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442424" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442424"></a><figcaption>The quest marker for the Dawnshore Cartographer in Mapping the Living Lands</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442424-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.05.53.22.png"></figure><p>As you can see, the area of the Dawnshore cartographer is right above the Usher's Hand region, which is a brief walk east of Paradis' walls. If you go directly to Usher's Hand, though, you'll be met with a tall cliff you need to climb to reach the cartographer's actual location.</p><p>Inside the quest area, the exact location of Geirmund is right in the center near the God's Gate fast travel beacon. Geirmund is lying on the ground, dead, next to a large stone column. Right beside Geirmund's body is the quest item called "Geirmund's Map," which you need to pick up to progress the Mapping the Living Lands quest in Avowed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442430" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442430"></a><figcaption>Geirmund's map location in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442430-avowedscreenshot2025.02.06-23.07.16.53.png"></figure><p>With Geirmund's Map in hand, return to Sanza in Paradis and give him the bad news about his cartographer. While Geirmund is dead, there are other cartographers out in the Living Lands that you can find as you explore more maps in Avowed. Those are also a part of the Mapping the Living Lands quest, but you can't unlock them until you reach the other maps in the game.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is the latest RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, the same development studio behind The Outer Worlds, Pillars of Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, and other acclaimed titles. Set in a fantasy world of magic and curses, Avowed pits you as a Godlike who needs to stop a plague from consuming an entire foreign continent. At the same time, you're an imperial envoy from your homeland and need to contend with political dissidents, assassins, and warring settlements.</p><p>Across your journey in Avowed, you'll complete dozens of quests, recruit several companions, and travel to vastly different environments. One question you might have before jumping into Avowed is exactly how long it takes to beat the new RPG. We'll answer that question for all playstyles in the guide below.</p><h2>How long to beat Avowed - Main story length</h2><p>If you're just looking to beat Avowed's main story, it will take you roughly 25 hours if you breeze right through it without partaking in any additional content. Hopping from main quest to main quest will cause you to miss a majority of the different maps in Avowed, however. The main quests only take you to a few set locations on all of the maps, leaving much of the other areas unexplored if you only stick to the story.</p><p>The main story in Avowed takes place over four different maps, but you unlock each map subsequently throughout the story. The maps are all open world, so you can explore them fully as soon as you enter each one. As you explore the maps, which are uncovered through a fog system, you'll unlock new points of interest, such as fast travel beacons, party waystones, dungeons, etc. Hopping from fast travel points can save you a tremendous amount of time during the main story, but in turn, you need to spend time unlocking those points in the first place.</p><h2>How long to beat Avowed - All playstyles</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442876"></a><figcaption>Avowed is no stranger to unique and compelling locations. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4442876-avowedscreenshot2025.02.08-21.02.08.79.png"></figure><p>For main-story enthusiasts who might turn their combat difficulty down to Easy or Story, you can blow through Avowed in around 20-25 hours.

In order to get the most out of each Totem, you will need to find all seven pieces, including the base. The Totem of Rightful Rulership can be found in Dawnshore, the first area. There is a document you can find to add the list of totem pieces to your quest, but it doesn't provide map markers, just single-sentence clues to the pieces locations. In this guide, we'll show you where to find all pieces, including the base, which you'll need to place in your camp in order to enjoy any of its passive buffs.

                <p>It seems like the PS5 and Xbox Series X came out just yesterday, but it appears that Xbox is already looking ahead to the next generation of hardware. A <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-might-legit-publish-more-games-on-ps5-this-year-than-sony-does-gamers-react-to-playstation-state-of-play-and-the-strange-times-xbox-finds-itself-in#xenforo-comments-539992" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new report</a> from Windows Central's Jez Corden says that "Xbox's next-gen console hardware" has moved past early pitch stages, meaning that it's been approved by management for the next stage of development.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not clear what exactly this might mean for the timeline of said console's reveal and ultimate release, but it's a possible indication that Xbox is moving forward with a clear idea for its new console. Xbox representatives have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGlD9SO3rKU">consistently promised</a> that its next console will make the "largest technical leap" ever seen from one hardware generation to another, which is a significant promise, given that the Xbox Series X is already the most powerful console ever made.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer recently said that the next Xbox should be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-should-be-more-innovative-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529067/" data-ref-id="1100-6529067">more innovative</a>"--what exactly that looks like remains to be seen. Microsoft has continued to embrace its multi-platform strategy, as its recent timed exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-platforms-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6520456/" data-ref-id="1100-6520456">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will hit PS5 next spring. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">Rumors and speculation</a> from analysts have big franchises like the new Gears of War or Perfect Dark might come to PS5 as well, given Xbox's stated approach. Meanwhile, PlayStation's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/">State of Play</a> event featured the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/">Saros</a>, the next game from Returnal developer Housemarque, as well as Days Gone Remastered.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's cross-platform release strategy puts the company in a unique position this year--as it currently stands, there are more Xbox first-party games than Sony titles confirmed for a PlayStation release in 2025.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256" data-mce-href="/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/">February 2025 State of Play livestream</a> on Wednesday contained announcements for several games, but the presentation showcased very few first-party PlayStation games, instead highlighting many third-party titles like Monster Hunter Wilds and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459" data-mce-href="/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/">Borderlands 4</a>. The only notable Sony-published PS5 titles shown were a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/" data-ref-id="1100-6529467" data-mce-href="/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/">Days Gone re-release</a>, Lost Soul Aside, and Housemarque's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/" data-ref-id="1100-6529469" data-mce-href="/articles/saros-is-returnal-developer-housemarques-new-game-starring-rahul-kohli/1100-6529469/">Saros</a>, which is scheduled for 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-uBOF0T2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S-uBOF0T2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those keeping track (and as pointed out by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-nintendo-everything-we-learned-switch-2-1-1-1" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-newscast-nintendo-everything-we-learned-switch-2-1-1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Sony's PS5 games confirmed for 2025 are Days Gone Remastered, Lost Soul Aside, MLB: The Show 25 (which also releases for Xbox and Nintendo Switch), Ghost of Yōtei, and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. Release windows for Marvel's Wolverine, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, and Marathon from Bungie have yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Conversely, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156" data-mce-href="/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Doom: The Dark Ages, Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition, Age of Mythology: Retold, The Outer Worlds 2, and Ninja Gaiden 4 confirmed for PS5 this year.</p><p>That's seven PS5 games from Microsoft, not even including the inevitable next Call of Duty game, compared to Sony's own five titles with solid 2025 release windows. It's a bizarre future for console owners dedicated to one brand over the other, but a future we'll all have to get used to as more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-microsoft-decides-when-xbox-games-come-to-playstation/1100-6528310/" data-ref-id="1100-6528310" data-mce-href="/articles/how-microsoft-decides-when-xbox-games-come-to-playstation/1100-6528310/">Xbox properties potentially migrate to PlayStation</a>.</p><p>Of course, the balance between the two competitors in this year's release schedule could shift as Sony announces more dates for its titles. Ultimately, this ironic twist may not matter to Sony, which touted successful hardware sales numbers from its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/" data-ref-id="1100-6529481" data-mce-href="/articles/playstation-just-had-its-best-sales-quarter-yet-ps5-lifetime-sales-now-at-75-million/1100-6529481/">most recent quarter</a>, with 9.5 million PS5 consoles shipped and 75 million sold in the platform's lifetime.</p>
