                <p>Warhorse's celebrated RPG Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is now available without DRM. The popular RPG has launched today, March 28, on the DRM-free game store, GOG. Additionally, a special quest that was previously only available as a preorder bonus is now available for everyone to buy.</p><p>The game's $60 Standard and $80 Gold editions are <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fkingdom_come_deliverance_ii&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fkingdom-come-2-is-now-available-drm-free-as-preorder-quest-now-available-for-everyone-to-buy%2F1100-6530469%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to buy now on GOG.</a> The Gold edition includes a variety of extras, including post-launch expansions and the Gallant Huntsman's Kit.</p><p>Kingcome Come: Deliverance II originally launched in early February for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. It's also available via GameSpot's sister site <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fkingdom-come-deliverance-ii&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fkingdom-come-2-is-now-available-drm-free-as-preorder-quest-now-available-for-everyone-to-buy%2F1100-6530469%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fanatical</a>.</p><p>The lack of DRM on GOG is one of the platform's most defining and differentiating elements. It also might explain why some games do not launch on GOG right away, over fears of piracy.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been a smashing success so far, selling millions of copies and earning rave reviews. The game will receive paid expansion content, including three expansions coming this year.</p><p>The game's gigantic 1.2 update came out earlier this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/massive-kingdom-come-2-patch-out-now-with-1000-fixes-and-improvements/1100-6530106/" data-ref-id="1100-6530106">1,000+ fixes</a>, in addition to a new feature that lets you change your character's appearance.</p><p>In other news, Warhorse has announced that The Lion's Crest quest is now available to buy--this introduces new armor and weapons for yourself and your horse. This content, which is available to buy for $5, was previously only available to people who preordered the game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1905651096577868232" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Lion’s Crest quest is now available for purchase!

Designed to be a guidebook authored by the mysterious Merchant who appears at the start of each level, Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire covers locations and secrets from the award-winning game.</p><p>"Vampire survivors are on a relentless quest," the official plot synopsis reads. "Stumbling through the Mad Forest, climbing the calamitous Gallo Tower, searching the far reaches of the Inlaid Library. The Belpaese family, the Ladonnas, assorted clerics and supernatural folk all join the search. Why is there roast chicken everywhere? How is that dog making flowers bloom? And who – or what – is Poe Ratcho?</p><p>And where are the vampires? That’s where I come in. I am the Merchant, and I can be your guide. If you have gold of course. Always gold. If you seek coffins, I may know where to find them--for a price. Though I cannot guarantee you’ll find the vampires you seek."</p></div>                      </div><p>In case you haven't played it yet, Vampire Survivors is a fun game that feels deceptively simple to play. Unlike other bullet-hell adventures where you have to constantly dodge projectiles, the game flips that script on its head and turns you into a tornado of doom as you gradually increase your power through a 30-minute run. The catch here is that the longer you survive the more progressively difficult a level becomes, and even if you can last for 30 minutes, the Grim Reaper will always be ready to claim your life at the end. The game is very affordable, and if you have a Game Pass account, available to play on PC and Xbox through that subscription service.</p><hr><p>It's going to be a while before this book is available, but in the meantime, you can score a pretty great deal on a bunch of other video game lore and art books.

                <p>Netflix Gaming boss Alain Tascan has outlined his vision for the future of gaming at Netflix, and his aim is to help reduce "friction" similar to how the Wii helped opened things up for a wider audience.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business,</a> Tascan said when he worked at EA, one of his ambitions was around "lowering friction and eliminating it." He was a big fan of the Wii because it was a lower-priced console that appealed to a wide audience, and Tascan wants to try to achieve something similar at Netflix.</p><p>Tascan said some of the frictions that exists in gaming today is the need to have enough controllers in a home and having an "expensive" piece of dedicated gaming hardware. Waiting for game downloads is another friction, Tascan said. Netflix Gaming aims to offer solutions in these areas by eliminating the need for dedicated gaming consoles and controllers, in part because Netflix aims to offer games over the cloud. In fact, cloud-streaming games is already available on Netflix.com under the Games tab.</p><p>Tascan hopes Netflix can create more "party games" that can help people have fun quickly--without the need for a console or a special controller.</p><p>"For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," he said. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen… if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"</p><p>Tascan went on to say that what he's excited about at Netflix is helping games reach more people.</p><p>"The same way mobile opened up gaming to go beyond 150--200 million players to now 3.2--3.3 billion players, I believe we can reach to a larger number of players," he said. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games? There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting. Netflix is giving us this opportunity to have access to these people. What do we give them, and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"</p><p>Finally, Tascan addressed a question regarding Netflix's commitment to gaming. After all, the company already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">shuttered its AAA game studio to instead focus on mobile and party games</a>. Google, many will remember, was heavily invested in gaming with its Stadia product, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">quickly shutter it. </a></p><p>Tascan said to find success in a market like gaming, "it takes time, stubbornness, and investment to get great results." Not every company is willing to put in the time and effort, but Tascan said Netflix is different.</p><p>"If you look at our two Co-CEOs, Ted [Sarandos] has been in the company 25 years, Greg [Peters] over 15 years. And look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business. They know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it," Tascan said. "The road is not always straight to the top. But I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there’s no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular, but also the rest of management, I believe in their full commitment."</p>
