                <p>Prior to Marvel Rivals, casual superhero fans may have only been familiar with Moon Knight's live-action 2022 Disney+ series starring Oscar Isaac. The Fist of Khonshu first appeared in comics 50 years ago when he went up against Marvel's Werewolf by Night. However, some fans believe that Moon Knight has a grudge against Dracula because of a popular meme, and now even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> is getting in on the fun with some very amusing callbacks in the game.</p><p>The meme in question features artwork from one of Marvel's comics, but the dialogue was reedited to make Moon Knight angry at the lord of the vampires over an unpaid debt. This never happened in Marvel's comics, and Moon Knight hasn't had a lot of interactions with Dracula in-continuity.</p><p>Marvel Rivals continuity isn't bound by that technicality, and NetEase apparently added in a few Easter eggs for the meme in the new map, Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park, which debuted as part of mid-Season 1 update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">Dracula is one of the main villains of Season 1</a>, and Moon Knight was one of the first heroes in Marvel Rivals. They haven't crossed paths on-screen yet, but Moon Knight mentions the debt Dracula owes him in the clips below.</p><p>So far, the two specific lines of dialogue that came up for Moon Knight in this map are "Dracula's here? Good, that bloodsuckin' nerd owes me big" and that it's "time for Dracula to pay up." There's also another reference to it in Moon Knight's in-game lore tab. In the text where Moon Knight is conversing with his patron deity, Khonshu, he says that "[vampires] suck" and "Dracula owes me money."</p><p>This lighthearted touch is a welcome discovery after the news about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">NetEase laying off some of Marvel Rivals' developers</a> despite the game's massive success. A recent report even suggested that NetEase considered replacing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">Marvel's characters or canceling the game outright</a> to avoid paying Disney for the rights to use them in the game. Regardless of whether either option was ever a viable choice, Marvel Rivals has already established itself as one of NetEase's most popular titles in a very short time.</p>

                <p>BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk has claimed that Xbox could've had another potential franchise hit in the RPG Jade Empire if it wasn't for Microsoft's short-sighted advice.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4C53o2G7q64HMCeqf54Qyz?si=02ac49c328d34de8&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=526b6e50087f44ba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Zeschuk said that Microsoft convinced BioWare to release Jade Empire at the tail-end of the original Xbox's lifecycle. "It was the worst advice; absolute moronic advice from them. The stupidest thing ever," he explained.</p><p>He claimed that Jade Empire should've been an Xbox 360 launch game, which would've made it more successful as a product at the beginning of the console's lifecycle as opposed to the end of the previous console's lifecycle.</p><p>Zeschuk explained that if he had pushed for more development time and money, Jade Empire could've joined the ranks of fabled franchises like Mass Effect and Dragon Age. "Give us six months; give us the chance to make it a launch title for the 360 and we'd have another franchise," he said.</p><p>Jade Empire launched on the original Xbox in April 2005, and the Xbox 360 was released in November 2005. The most recent <a href="https://www.newspapers.com/article/edmonton-journal/88437678/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">estimate of the game's sales</a> was back in July 2005, where it crossed 500K units sold, which was below expectations.</p><p>While Jade Empire is backwards compatible with Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S, there have been no subsequent entries outside of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/jade-empire-special-edition-review/1900-6166271/" data-ref-id="1900-6166271">enhanced PC port in 2007</a> and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/biowares-classic-action-rpg-jade-empire-hits-ios/1100-6444254/" data-ref-id="1100-6444254">iOS port in 2016</a>. Back in 2011, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-sequel-confirmed/1100-6139680/" data-ref-id="1100-6139680">expressed interest in creating more games</a> in the Jade Empire universe, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-empire-2-stillborn-on-pc-ps3-and-xbox-360/1100-6308731/" data-ref-id="1100-6308731">any hopes of a sequel</a> were eventually dashed.</p>

It includes fan-favorite games such as Turtles in Time and Tournament Fighters, as well as the infamous NES game in case you want to relive the horrible underwater levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game has been updated with quality-of-life features such as save states, rewinding, and custom button layouts, and some of them feature local and online co-op play.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">A couple of months after the unveiling, CD Projekt Red has decided to pull the curtains back to showcase how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4's</a> debut trailer came together in partnership with <a href="https://platige.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platige Image</a>. The developer discusses that a major theme was showcasing how Ciri is somewhat of a mirror to a Stromford girl named Mioni.</p><p dir="ltr">The behind-the-scenes video for The Witcher 4 (seen below and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a>) begins with director Sebastian Kalemba stating "that this is the moment to tell the story with Ciri." From there, the RPG's narrative director Philipp Weber opens up about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/">The Witcher 4's first trailer</a>--which debuted at The Game Awards in December--follows how two women approach destiny differently.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGJ-B7v5tYI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We were thinking in the story that Mioni and Ciri are a little bit mirrors of each other," Weber said. "The traditions of Stromford essentially mean that Mioni has to be sacrificed. That's her destiny, and she accepted that destiny. Ciri is known as someone who does not accept destiny, she fights back at it."</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red notes that the reveal trailer highlights this mirroring from the get-go, as Mioni gets dressed in a village tradition and Ciri prepares in a Witcher style. Additionally, the developer points out that Ciri does things differently than Geralt would do. Last month, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-voice-actor-is-excited-to-see-the-witcher-4-focus-on-ciri/1100-6528960/">expressed his excitement about The Witcher 4 focusing on Ciri</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the mirroring theme, the behind-the-scenes video gives insight into the production of the RPG's debut trailer. For example, Platige Image says the motion-capture session lasted around 14 days, with another three days spent for on-site shooting and testing. There's discussion about the Slavic style being used artistically as well as the animation behind the Bauk monster.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time CD Projekt Red has elaborated on the trailer, either. After the unveiling in December, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/">Kalemba broke down The Witcher 4 trailer</a> and confirmed the story within the video will be seen in-game. GameSpot also got a chance to chat with Kalemba <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/">about Ciri, Gwent, and in-game romance</a>. There is no release date yet for the game.</p>
