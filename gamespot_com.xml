                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> beta has officially begun, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-is-off-to-a-very-hot-start-amid-some-server-hiccups/1100-6533756/" data-ref-id="1100-6533756">already surpassed Battlefield 2042's peak player count</a> on Steam. Hundreds of thousands of players have jumped in, which has led to some massive queue times, but not everyone of these players is a Battlefield veteran. The beta is full of players who are simply looking for a new first-person shooter or dipping their toes into Battlefield to see if they like the experience or not.</p><p>If you're one of those new players or a player returning to the franchise after a long hiatus, you might be confused about the different game modes available in Battlefield 6. There are four game mode options, but the game doesn't explain them too well in the menus. To find out more about the Battlefield 6 game modes and see which one might suit your playstyle the best, check out the guide below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_every_game_mode_in_Battlefield_6_works">How every game mode in Battlefield 6 works</a><ul><li><a href="#Conquest">Conquest</a></li><li><a href="#Closed_Weapon_Conquest">Closed Weapon Conquest</a></li><li><a href="#Breakthrough">Breakthrough</a></li><li><a href="#Domination">Domination</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_every_game_mode_in_Battlefield_6_works">How every game mode in Battlefield 6 works</h2><p>During the open beta in Battlefield 6, there are four game modes you can choose from:</p><ul><li><strong>Conquest</strong></li><li><strong>Closed Weapon Conquest</strong></li><li><strong>Breakthrough</strong></li><li><strong>Domination </strong></li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545959" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545959"></a><figcaption>The four game modes in the Battlefield 6 beta</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545959-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.25.44.38.png"></figure><p>More game modes will arrive at the full launch, but this is what you can play during the open beta. While you can hop into each one and see how the game mode works for yourself first-hand, it's always better to have a little bit of knowledge beforehand.</p><p>Below, we'll summarize each game mode, including its goal, how to win, and the playstyles it caters to.</p><h3 id="Conquest">Conquest</h3><p>Conquest is the bread-and-butter game mode of the Battlefield franchise. It's what the franchise has become known for over the years, and it works very similarly to how it has in the past in Battlefield 6.</p><p>The mode sees two teams, each of which can be made up of as many as 32 players, spawn on opposite ends of a large-scale map. Starting at each team's base are a variety of vehicles, including tanks, helicopters, off-road SUVs, and more. The vehicles available are dependent on the map you're playing. In addition to the vehicles, six flags are spread out across the map, labeled A through F. Each team will begin near either the A or F flag, and the flags need to be captured by standing in their zones, which are indicated by lines on the ground.</p><p>The overall goal of Conquest is to capture as many flags as possible and eliminate enemies as they try to take your team's flags or defend their own. Points are earned by capturing more flags and keeping them under your team's control for longer periods of time. You can capture an enemy team's flag by standing on its zone for roughly one to two minutes, but the enemy team can also do the same to your flags.</p><p>As the match proceeds, you'll see the score bar at the top of your screen fluctuate. Each team starts with 1,000 points, and those points get depleted the less flag control you have. Eventually, a team will reach zero points, and the first team to do that has lost the match. So, in a nutshell, Conquest is about holding flags for longer so you can deplete the other team's points.</p><p>When you die in Conquest, you have to wait for a few seconds to respawn. Your spawn point can be on one of your squad's locations or at one of your team's active flags. Every person is grouped into a squad of four, and coordination with your squad is key so you know where to push on the map.</p><p>A Conquest match can take anywhere from 20-30 minutes in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Closed_Weapon_Conquest">Closed Weapon Conquest</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545961"></a><figcaption>Closed Weapon Conquest forces you to use only weapons from your class</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545961-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.52.46.85.png"></figure><p>This game mode is exactly like the base Conquest mode, but every player is locked to the weapon of their chosen class. So, for example, if you choose the Assault class, you can only use an assault rifle, as that's the signature weapon of that class. If you go with the Engineer class, you're locked to SMGs, Support is locked to LMGs, and Recon is locked to snipers.</p><p>Of course, you're also able to pull out your secondary weapons and gadgets as well. This means Assault class players can pick between their rifle, pistol, and two gadget weapons that can be a shotgun, DMR, carbine, or explosive sidearm.</p><p>The point of Closed Weapon Conquest is for players to use their class the way it was intended in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Breakthrough">Breakthrough</h3><p>Breakthrough is another classic Battlefield game mode, and matches in this mode can take the longest out of any other. It also takes place on large-scale maps with teams of 30+ players. However, Breakthrough assigns teams one of two roles: Attackers or Defenders.</p><p>The team of Attackers' job is to push their forces forward on the map, capturing objectives along the way and continually pushing the enemy team back. The Attackers succeed if they push all the way up the map, reaching the enemy's team base within a certain timeframe.</p><p>Speaking of the enemy team, that's where the Defenders come in. The Defenders' sole goal is to stop the Attackers from pushing up on the map and capturing objectives. Defenders often hold specific positions that make it difficult for the Attackers to get around them and push up the map. However, if Defenders aren't coordinated, Attackers can bust through their defenses and make it very tough to stop them as they keep moving forward.</p><p>Breakthrough matches can take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to complete in Battlefield 6.</p><h3 id="Domination">Domination</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545964"></a><figcaption>Fighting over the B flag in Domination is crucial</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4545964-bf6event.exescreenshot2025.08.07-16.54.09.75.png"></figure><p>Last up, we have Domination. If you're coming from Call of Duty, then this is the exact same game mode you know and love. It's also very similar to Strongholds from Halo, but the scoring works slightly differently.</p><p>In Domination, you're playing a scaled-down version of Conquest. The maps take place in the same locations, but the playable areas are cut off due to only three flags being available to capture (A, B, C). Teams spawn in on either A or C and must fight over the B flag while also trying to capture the enemy's spawn flag and defend their own.</p><p>Two teams, which are made up of eight players each, start at zero points in Domination and must try to earn 200 to be declared the winner. Teams score by owning at least one flag, but you score more points the more flags you have. So, if a team has two flags, they'll score points at a faster rate compared to the team that just has one flag. If you don't own any flags, you don't score at all.</p><p>Spawning is immediate in Domination, and you don't get to choose where you spawn, like in Conquest. This makes matches a little more chaotic, and they tend to finish much quicker than any other game mode. Domination is perfect for players who seek quicker action and fewer players to deal with on the map. The mode also doesn't feature any vehicles.</p><p>And that does it for all of the current game modes in Battlefield 6. As we said before, more are coming with the full launch in October, so we'll update this guide with those modes when they are released.

<p dir="ltr">As for the teammates of leavers or those with an AFK member, NetEase is looking to ease the sting of losing a teammate in the 6v6 hero shooter. If a disconnection or AFK players is detected within the first 70 seconds of a competitive match, the match will be deemed invalid, with penalties for the leaver or AFK player but no negative results or penalties for other players in the match.</p><p dir="ltr">If a disconnected or AFK player later rejoins, if their team wins, they won't receive a penalty, but will if their team loses. Other players on the losing team will receive ranked-point compensation, easing the sting of the loss.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been adjustments to matchmaking as well, with players in higher ranks no longer being able to queue as a larger team. In Platinum, Diamond, and Grandmaster, players can only form up to a three-player team to enter matchmaking, while Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All players can only queue in teams of two.</p><p dir="ltr">While that's the majority of what makes up the patch, there are a few other changes. On PC, shaders will now compile in the background, players can now zoom out and use emotes while in the team lobby, and unique costume voice and sound effects can now be toggled for specific costumes. The only major gameplay change is increased audio cues for Wolverine and Black Panther in order to give those they are ambushing a chance to hear them coming.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blade-joins-marvel-rivals-august-8-along-with-new-and-removed-team-ups/1100-6533566/" data-ref-id="1100-6533566">Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 additionally adds Blade</a> to the game's ever-expanding superhero roster, alongside the removal (and addition) of a number of team-up abilities. NetEase previously announced it would start <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-record-all-voice-chat-to-target-toxic-players/1100-6533630/" data-ref-id="1100-6533630">recording voice chat in Marvel Rivals</a> and automatically screen it for toxicity, after which a human would review the logs and determine whether a player should be banned or punished. You can read the full patch notes below, and the compensation and punishment scaling charts on the game's <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250801/41548_1251405.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 3.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>All Platforms</h3><h4>New Hero</h4><p>Blade is on his feet and itching to join the fight in Marvel Rivals!</p><h4>New Stories</h4><p>New Blade lore - Cut to The Chase</p><p>New Iron Man lore - The Celestial Iron Man</p><p>New Rocket Raccoon lore - The Deepest Bond</p><h4>Limited-Time Event: Queen's Codex</h4><p>The Queen is coming!

The required votes passes with 1 less than the current team members. (E.g., if 4 remain, 3 votes are needed.)</p><h3>Disconnect Penalty and Compensation Adjustments</h3><h4>Invalid Matches</h4><p>If any player disconnects during loading, ban/pick phase, hero select, or within the first 70 seconds of a match, the match is deemed invalid. The disconnected player receives a T1 Penalty (see below for details) that scales with repeated offenses and penalty count increases. For other players, the match ends with no result or penalty.</p><h4>Valid Matches</h4><p>If a player disconnects after 70 seconds, the following applies:</p><p>1. Disconnected player does NOT reconnect before the match ends:</p><p>- If the match ends within 90 seconds of their disconnect:</p><p>Normal settlement based on match result and stats; no penalty.</p><p>- If the match ends 90 C150 seconds after their disconnect:</p><p>Disconnected player receives a T1 Point Penalty and Competitive Matchmaking Ban (both scale with repeat offenses) and penalty count increases (win or lose). If the disconnected team loses, remaining teammates receive ranked point compensation.</p><p>- If the match ends 150+ seconds after their disconnect:</p><p>Disconnected player receives a T2 Point Penalty and Competitive Matchmaking Ban (both scale with repeat offenses) and penalty count increases (win or lose).

Teammates do not receive compensation.</p><h4>Combined AFK &amp; Disconnect Penalty</h4><p>1. If a player is both inactive and disconnects, the highest penalty applies.</p><p>2. If a team is faced with both inactive and disconnected players and that team loses, compensation is granted to fully engaged teammates.</p><h4>Quick Match Penalties</h4><p>In Quick Match mode, we've also strengthened the penalty duration for players who disconnect and leave the game:</p><p>We will continue to monitor disconnections and early exits in both Ranked and Quick Match modes and adjust these rules as necessary.

The "Special" tab in the Store now lets you browse all available Moods, Emoji, and unique Emotes.</p><h3>Graphics &amp; Performance</h3><h4>PC</h4><p>1. PC Shader Compilation Rework: The mandatory shader compilation wait on first launch has been removed. Instead, essential global shaders will now preload in the background after installation/update. (Shader preload speed depends on your GPU, entering a match before preloading competes may cause performance issues, including stuttering, network lag, rendering errors, or crashes.)</p><p>2. The performance test tool now provides graphics settings optimization recommendations based on your test results.</p><p>3. In-game UI animation details will now automatically adjust based on your effects detail settings to improve overall performance.</p><h4>Maps and Modes</h4><p>1. Fixed several terrain issues that could cause characters to sometimes become stuck or clip into strange areas.</p><h4>Heroes</h4><p>1. Jumping the Gun: Polished up a minor bug where Emma Frost, Iron Fist, Phoenix, and Wolverine were out-leaping the competition with slightly higher jump heights. Now everyone's jump is perfectly balanced, as all things should be!</p><p>2. Iron Fist's Silent Sanctuary: Resolved an issue where Lin Lie's Harmony Recovery would sometimes end without playing its ending sound effect. The Iron Fist can now find his inner peace with the proper zen, no more silent retreats in K'un-Lun!</p><p>3. Venom &amp; Spider-Man Slinging in Style: Spidey and The Symbiote can now set separate keybinds for simple and manual swinging. Choose your web-slinging style on the fly!</p><p>4. Panther &amp; Wolverine's Sneaky Sounds: Enhanced the audio cues for enemy Black Panther and Wolverine when they're sneaking up for a surprise attack. Now, when these clawed kings are on the prowl, you might hear them coming. Predator awareness up!</p><h3>Console</h3><p>1. Fixed an issue where changing global keybinds could incorrectly affect some hero ability keys.</p>
