                <p>PlayStation Portal owners can now stream their games from the cloud, Sony has announced. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-update-adds-more-features-to-cloud-streaming/1100-6530723/">After rolling out a beta version last year</a>, the updated version of Cloud Streaming will allow PS Plus Premium members to play a massively expanded selection of games on the device, and it won't require them to connect to a PS5 console through Remote Play.</p><p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/ps5-game-cloud-streaming/">there are 2,845 games that support PS Portal Cloud Streaming</a>. This includes several of Sony's biggest first-party titles like Ghost of Yotei and Astro Bot, alongside third-party titles like Borderlands 4 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth. Games from the PS Plus Game Catalog and Classics Catalog are compatible as well, and Sony has introduced a new home screen that features three tabs to help distinguish between the various modes: Remote Play, Cloud Streaming, and Search.</p><p>Remote Play requires a PS5 console paired to a PS Portal so that installed games can be streamed directly from the system onto the handheld. This mode doesn't require a PS Plus Premium membership, but Cloud Streaming does. The search option will let users look up any game that supports Cloud Streaming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596866"></a><figcaption>A closer look at new PS Portal features.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596866-portal-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596867,1300-4596868,1300-4596869" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596867-portal-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596868-portal-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4596869-portal-4.jpg"></figure><p>Other new features being introduced for both Remote Play and Cloud Streaming include 3D audio support when using a compatible audio device like the Pulse Explore wireless earbuds, a passcode lock screen, and a network status screen so that PS Portal owners can quickly check the quality of their connection.</p><p>The new features that'll be unique for the Cloud Streaming functions are updated accessibility options, an in-game store that supports in-game purchases during a game stream, and game invites from friends who are playing the same game.</p><p>Sony launched the PS Portal in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/">and while the device was a tough recommendation due to its limited use-case</a>, critics and users did note that it was still a well-designed piece of hardware. Thanks to the PlayStation Link technology created for it, games streamed on the PS Portal benefited from low latency and lossless audio. Meanwhile, Sony is also looking to the future for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">rumored PS6</a>, and a recent video teased some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">potentially groundbreaking technology</a> that the company is developing as part of a partnership with AMD.</p>
