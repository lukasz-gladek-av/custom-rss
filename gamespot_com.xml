                <p dir="ltr">Disco Elysium is coming to mobile devices for the first time later this year, and we got exclusive hands (and thumbs) on with the new version of the RPG. This isn't a simple port whatsoever. In fact, GameSpot's Lucy James admits that "it is very different to what I thought it was going to be."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHcM71FPjPH/?igsh=MW1ib3hlNnE1Znd0bw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow ">On Instagram</a>, James shows off Disco Elysium running on Android and how the RPG is making the transition to smartphones. The game originally launched on PC in 2019 before coming to other consoles in the years that followed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-releases-on-nintendo-switch-october-12/1100-6496489/">such as Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>. But with this new port, how you engage with Disco Elysium is different. "It's meant to be played in these shorter bursts, rather than sitting down and really committing to a very dense RPG," said James.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the controls, Disco Elysium is embracing how people use their smartphones. "The way you interact with it is how you interact with your phone," James said. Basically, you're swiping and tapping with your thumb while your smartphone stays in portrait mode. So it looks possible to play through the experience with one hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, developer ZA/UM Studio announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">the mobile edition of Disco Elysium for launch this summer</a>. The studio has faced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/">a very public breakup with the RPG's director and art director</a>, who claim they were forced out of the company by investors. However, ZA/UM is forging ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/">a new espionage RPG called Project C4</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-review-pure-dynamite/1900-6417354/">Disco Elysium review</a>, which received a rare 10/10 score.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 actor Samantha Beart, who played Karlach, has spoken out against artificial intelligence technologies being used for short-term gain. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a>, Beart said CEOs want to use AI to "save money," but long-term reputational damage may be coming for those who take this approach.</p><p>"In the long term, it'll destroy their reputation, their company, everything," Beart said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/baldur-s-gate/baldurs-gate-3-karlach-actor-says-ceos-just-want-to-save-money-with-ai-itll-destroy-their-reputation-their-company-everything/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Beart went on to say that actors are unlikely to back down in the fight against AI because doing so would mean, "You've just signed your way out of any sort of job or career."</p><p>"We have an industry of highly artistic people who've had a calling to do this stuff, and then you've got these people with money, who don't play games, who see it as an easy way to make a return on investment," Beart said.</p><p>Video game voice actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike against video game companies, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">issues around AI said to be the final sticking point in the talks</a>.</p><p>"The dream of the tech industry is to sell off your company at an overinflated price and retire," Beart said. "And I feel that's being done with game studios right now."</p><p>Video game voice actors have been on strike since July 2024, meaning the strike has now stretched beyond seven months. SAG-AFTRA video game performers also went on strike in 2016, with a work stoppage spanning 18 months.</p><p>A recent study found that the majority of game developers worldwide use AI technologies to make games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">despite workers raising major concerns</a>. AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses with fears about generative AI being used to potentially take jobs. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-uses-horizons-aloy-to-demonstrate-new-ai-tech-and-its-about-as-impressive-as-youd-expect/1100-6530023/" data-ref-id="1100-6530023">a recent video showed Horizon's Aloy in a tech demo for an AI assistant</a>--and people quickly voiced their concerns about this. Even Aloy's actor, Ashly Burch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-worried-in-wake-of-ai-aloy-video/1100-6530163/" data-ref-id="1100-6530163">spoke out to criticize it</a>. </p>

                <p>Microsoft has recently revealed a new UI mockup for Xbox that shows what games players own across a variety of devices and storefronts, including Steam.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft posted a new blog post that had a picture of the proposed UI, but it was subsequently removed. In the picture, you can see games like Diablo IV and Microsoft Flight Simulator in the "recently added" in the UI. However, you can also see the "Steam" and "Game Pass" tabs, indicating that you'll be able to see sort games based on which platform you purchased them on.</p><p>It seems like the UI is just a mockup for now, as the "owned" and "action-adventure" tabs are listed twice. The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post </a>is about how Xbox is trying to reach a larger audience, as younger generations regular switch between platforms and expect seamless integration. So having a UI that displays different platforms makes sense.  Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">also reportedly working on an Xbox handheld</a> that's due out later this year, which is part of its strategy to unify Windows and Xbox towards a universal library of Xbox and PC games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4463044-image_2025-03-21_080631338.png" data-ref-id="1300-4463044" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4463044-image_2025-03-21_080631338.png" data-ref-id="1300-4463044"></a><figcaption>The Xbox UI mockup</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4463044-image_2025-03-21_080631338.png"></figure><p>According to The Verge, Microsoft is in fact currently working on an Xbox app update that'll let players see all the games that they own through Steam and the Epic Games Store. The update is reportedly in its early stages, so there's a chance that it might actually never see the light of day, but this mockup provides a glimpse into what it possibly could look like. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gog-announces-gog-galaxy-20-an-app-designed-to-fix/1100-6467097/" data-ref-id="1100-6467097">GOG Galaxy already has the functionality</a> to let you see what games you own across a variety of platforms, such as Steam.</p><p>Microsoft has recently been putting the Xbox experience on other devices, as well as putting its first-party titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">rival platforms</a>.
