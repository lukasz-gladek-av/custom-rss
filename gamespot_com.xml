                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/" data-ref-id="5000-449545">Pokemon Go</a> is on the go again and traveling to the city of lights. Niantic, the developer of Pokemon Go, has announced that Pokemon Go Fest is heading to Paris, France and inviting trainers from all over the world to take part in the celebration.</p><p>Via the <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/go-fest-2025-events-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Go official site</a>, Pokemon Go Fest: Paris will take place in the city of Paris and the Parc de Sceaux from June 13-15. Early bird tickets are on sale today, March 6, before the tickets go up to full price on April 2. This event will feature the Pokemon Go debut of Volcanion, Every player with a ticket will receive access to special research about the creature and get a chance to encounter it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455027-pokemongofestparis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455027" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455027-pokemongofestparis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455027"></a><figcaption>The official poster for Pokemon Go Fest: Paris</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455027-pokemongofestparis.jpg"></figure><p>Players on hand will also have the first opportunity to see the new forms of Crowned Sword Zacian and Crowned Shield Zamazenta during Five Star Raids. As in Pokemon Go Fest's previous stops, Niantic will provide a curated route that will let players take in some of Paris' landmarks while keeping an eye out for elusive Pokemon. The Parc de Sceaux will have real-life Pokemon habitats where players can meet Pokemon mascots and trainers, compete head-to-head in the PVP battle ground, and shop for exclusive merchandise.</p><p>"The charm of Paris, its walkability, and its globally recognized landmarks create the perfect playground for Pok√©mon GO Fest," said Pokemon Go Live Events Marketing Manager Lena Cillis in a statement. "We're eager to see Trainers explore this beautiful city and the elegant Parc de Sceaux alongside France's passionate community and visitors from around the world."</p><p>Before this event, Pokemon Go Fest will visit Osaka, Japan from May 29-June 1, and Jersey City, New Jersey from June 6-8. Following Pokemon Go Fest: Paris, Ninatic will hold a Pokemon Go Fest Global event from June 28-29.</p><p>If you're looking for something to do sooner, Niantic has already shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-march-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-days-and-more/1100-6529806/" data-ref-id="1100-6529806">the Pokemon Go events for March</a>. Outside of Pokemon Go, The Pokemon Company CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara recently suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-boss-says-franchise-could-go-downhill-if-company-loses-its-focus/1100-6529772/" data-ref-id="1100-6529772">the franchise could go downhill</a> if the company ever loses its focus. So far, there are no signs of that happening. In fact, the next Pokemon Switch game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-three-starters-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/1100-6529758/" data-ref-id="1100-6529758">unveiled a few of its starter Pokeman</a> ahead of its launch late this year.</p>

                <p>In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.</p><h2>How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The Island</h2><p>There's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode. </p><p>Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035"></a><figcaption>Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg"></figure><p>Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p><p>Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036"></a><figcaption>...then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg"></figure><p>For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-showcase-match-list-all-bloodline-matches-and-rewards/2900-6302/" data-ref-id="2900-6302">Showcase matches list</a>, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.

Specifically, players will have the option of making use of an AI system that turns text prompts into in-game items like clothing, wall, and floor patterns. The game also includes a 3D printer-like feature that will allow players to upload photos of real-life objects and turn them into 3D assets to decorate and use in-game.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_are_InZoi_s_PC_requirements_">What are InZoi's PC requirements?</h2><p dir="ltr">InZoi's minimum PC specs and recommended PC specs are both listed below.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Minimum_requirements_">Minimum requirements:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i5 10400, AMD Ryzen 3600</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Memory:</strong> 12 GB RAM</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA RTX 2060 (8G VRAM), AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Storage:</strong> 60 GB available space</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Notes:</strong> Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Recommended_specs_">Recommended specs:</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel i7 12700, AMD Ryzen 5800</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Graphics:</strong> NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8G VRAM), AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Storage:</strong> 75 GB available space</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Notes:</strong> Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system.</li></ul><p>Stay tuned to GameSpot for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/news/">InZoi-related news</a> as its launch date approaches.</p>
