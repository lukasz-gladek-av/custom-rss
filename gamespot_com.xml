                <p>Amazon has revealed all of the free PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in March, and there's a pretty solid lineup of classic open-world, fantasy, and puzzle games to grab. In total, there'll be 20 games offered this month, with four games available right now. As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>The month kicks off with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row-the-third/" data-ref-id="5000-40483">Saints Row: The Third Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-32858">Mafia 2: Definitive Edition</a>. Considered to be the best in the Saints Row series, the threequel is a goofy sandbox of crime and dubstep-powered weapons, and this remastered edition features enhanced graphics and all of the post-launch DLC. Mafia 2: Definitive Edition is a story-driven open-world game set in the 1940s, as war hero Vito Scaletta becomes entangled with the mob.</p><p>You can also redeem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crime-boss-rockay-city/" data-ref-id="5000-577630">Crime Boss: Rockay City</a> if you feel like gawking at bad gameplay and want to see Chuck Norris as the bad guy, and there's also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naheulbeuks-dungeon-master/" data-ref-id="5000-590955">Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</a> to round out the first batch of games. March 13 will give you five more games to choose from, with the highlight here being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/endling-extinction-is-forever/" data-ref-id="5000-484683">Endling: Extinction is Forever</a>. It's not a game for the faint-hearted, as Endling lets you take control of the last mother fox on Earth. Driven to protect all of her cubs in a merciless world that is on the brink of destruction, Endling is a stressful and emotional survival-adventure game.</p><p>Moving ahead to March 20, the Prime Gaming library will expand with five more games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mortal-shell/" data-ref-id="5000-510197">Mortal Shell</a> is a flawed but interesting souls-like, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-403573">Wolfenstein: the Old Blood</a> is a spooky spin-off from the first Wolfenstein adventure developed by MachineGames, and you can jump into 2003's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/legacy-of-kain-defiance/" data-ref-id="5000-18258">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> to check out the final game in the classic series.</p><p>Finally, March 27 will see six more games arrive to cap the month off with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deus-ex-invisible-war/" data-ref-id="5000-3789">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-forgotten-city/" data-ref-id="5000-483405">The Forgotten City</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/session-skate-sim/" data-ref-id="5000-483355">Session: Skate Sim</a>.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for March 2025</h2><h3>Available now</h3><ul><li>Saints Row: The Third Remastered (GOG Code)</li><li>Mafia 2: Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 13</h3><ul><li>Wall World (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Syberia: The World Before (GOG Code)</li><li>Endling: Extinction is Forever (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Dark Deity: Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>Beholder 3 (Amazon Games App)</li></ul><h3>March 20</h3><ul><li>Wolfenstein: The Old Blood (Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code)</li><li>Mutazione (GOG Code)</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Legacy of Kain: Defiance (GOG Code)</li><li>Mortal Shell (Epic Games Store)</li></ul><h3>March 27</h3><ul><li>The Forgotten City (Amazon Games App)</li><li>Deus Ex: Invisible War (GOG Code)</li><li>Session: Skate Sim (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Let's Build A Zoo (Epic Games Store)</li><li>Gamedec - Definitive Edition (GOG Code)</li><li>The Wisbey Mystery (Legacy Games Code)</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in January via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>WRC Generations: Fully Loaded Edition</li><li>Overcooked 2</li><li>Spitlings</li><li>The Jackbox Party Pack 3</li><li>Strange Horticulture</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Fortnite Ballistic</li><li>Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Trackmania</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> has 12 side stories to discover. These are anomalies that occur in the world as a result of Mio and Zoe entering the same simulation. Razer tries to steal unfinished stories and ideas from the girls, and as such, there are some very weird occurrences going on.</p><p>Finding and experiencing side stories is a vital part of your Split Fiction experience, and you'll even get an achievement if you manage to find them all. They're split up by level, so we've detailed where they are and what happens during them. Almost all of them are easy to find, so we won't focus too much on location beyond which level they're in. If they're trickier to find, we'll provide more information on where they are.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Legend_of_the_Sandfish">The Legend of the Sandfish</a></li><li><a href="#Farmlife">Farmlife</a></li><li><a href="#Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</a><ul><li><a href="#Train_Heist">Train Heist</a></li><li><a href="#Gameshow">Gameshow</a></li><li><a href="#Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</a><ul><li><a href="#Kites">Kites</a></li><li><a href="#Moon_Market">Moon Market</a></li><li><a href="#Notebook">Notebook</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</a><ul><li><a href="#Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</a></li><li><a href="#Space_Escape">Space Escape</a></li><li><a href="#Birthday_Cake">Birthday Cake</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454765"></a><figcaption>Mountain Hike side story location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454765-mountain-hike-side-story.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Neon_Revenge">Neon Revenge</h2><h3 id="The_Legend_of_the_Sandfish">The Legend of the Sandfish</h3><p>The Legend of the Sandfish sees Mio and Zoe enter a sand-filled world where they have to dodge, dash, and work together to escape the sandfish. You'll need to think about timing and plan your routes, and at one point, you'll even find yourself on the back of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-escape-the-sandfish/1100-6529814/" data-ref-id="1100-6529814">sandfish</a>.</p><h3 id="Farmlife">Farmlife</h3><p>One of the funniest side stories in the game, Farmlife sees Mio and Zoe transform into pigs. Cute, right? Wrong! Eventually, Mio and Zoe will become sausages. No happy ending for pigs in this story.</p><h3 id="Mountain_Hike">Mountain Hike</h3><p>This is one of the trickier side stories to locate. When you find an area that you'll need to interact with some portable toilets, pause. Mio will need to enter the toilet, and Zoe needs to use her grab skill to pick it up and throw it at the ladder hanging from the roof to the left. This will drop the ladder down, revealing the path to the side story. It can also be easy to miss as it doesn't have the audio cue that other side stories have. When you do find it, it's totally worth it. Mio and Zoe will spend some time traversing a mountain, trying to dodge the footsteps and wrath of giants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454766"></a><figcaption>Exploding Star side story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454766-split-fiction-side-stories%284%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Hopes_of_Spring">Hopes of Spring</h2><h3 id="Train_Heist">Train Heist</h3><p>Train Heist is less of a heist and more of a chase, with Mio and Zoe returning to some side-scrolling action, fighting The Conductor, a large orb-like boss who isn't super happy about them being there.</p><h3 id="Gameshow">Gameshow</h3><p>This was one of the tricker side stories we experienced, as you're at the mercy of a deranged robot gameshow host who insists on creating entertainment out of forcing Mio and Zoe to handle ticking bombs. Each bomb can only remain in your hands for a few seconds before you need to pass it to your partner. The arena gets more complex each time, with fire, electricity, and disappearing platforms adding additional danger.</p><h3 id="Collapsing_Star">Collapsing Star</h3><p>During this side story, Mio and Zoe find themselves staring into the sun, quite literally. The sun is dying, and as it does it sends lethal waves of light through the world. You'll need to find areas to hide behind. A huge tip for the end of the story is Mio and Zoe should use one shield to cover them both, and alternate between whose shield to use. If you try to complete this side story just using your own shield to protect yourself, you'll never escape the collapse of the sun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454764"></a><figcaption>Kites Side Story</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454764-split-fiction-side-stories%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Final_Dawn">Final Dawn</h2><h3 id="Kites">Kites</h3><p>This side story is a race between Mio and Zoe as they traverse the skies via tunnels, kites, and wind sockets. Who will win? It can be tricky to aim for the circles that give you a boost through the air, and if you miss one you'll fall to your death. Our tip is to not move the camera angle as it quickly becomes disorienting.</p><h3 id="Moon_Market">Moon Market</h3><p>It's time to rescue some cats! Mio and Zoe have a total of four cats to rescue in order to open some gates that reveal the path forward. When you get the Moon Market itself, make sure to interact with the many elements around the town square, especially the potions.</p><h3 id="Notebook">Notebook</h3><p>This beautiful sketched art level sees Mio and Zoe on a quest to rescue a prince. It's easily located within the Factory level, as Zoe will point it out with an audio cue. As you traverse the level, Zoe will rewrite the story, and areas of the level will appear, disappear, and be modified.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454757"></a><figcaption>Birthday Cake</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4454757-split-fiction-side-stories%282%29.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Rise_of_the_Dragon_Realm">Rise of the Dragon Realm</h2><h3 id="Slopes_of_War">Slopes of War</h3><p>This is one of the most fun side stories in Split Fiction. Remember the SSX games? This is Split Fiction's version of those. Mio and Zoe take to futuristic snowboards, with the goal of racking up the best score possible.</p><h3 id="Space_Escape">Space Escape</h3><p>Mio and Zoe face the challenge of running out of oxygen in space. The grappling hook mechanic from earlier in the game returns with a twist as the two wrestle with zero gravity. There isn't a time limit, despite the fact Mio encourages Zoe to work as quickly as she can, but if you take too long the gravity meter will deplete so it's best to hurry along anyway. Make sure you work with your co-op partner to find oxygen tanks before it's too late.</p><h3 id="Birthday_Cake">Birthday Cake</h3><p>One of Mio's rare 'fun' side stories, she wrote this when she was younger. You'll control teeth that need to find their way through the level via bright cartoon platforming sections. Eventually, after lighting the candles on the birthday cake, you'll end up in a dentist's office trying to survive.</p><p>Now that you've ticked off all of the side stories, why not check out how to hatch the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-hatch-the-underlands-bird-egg/1100-6529869/" data-ref-id="1100-6529869">Underlands bird egg</a>, or how to get through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-how-to-get-past-underlands-piranhas/1100-6529867/" data-ref-id="1100-6529867">piranha-infested waters</a>, in case you're having trouble.</p>

                <p>The music world lost a legend this week, when Roy Ayers passed away at the age of 84. The jazz-funk pioneer was also the voice of Fusion FM, the in-game radio station in GTA IV.</p><p>Rockstar Games paid tribute to the late "Everybody Loves the Sunshine" musician in a social media post, saying, "Rest In Peace to the pioneer of Jazz Funk and host of Fusion FM, the legend Roy Ayers."</p><p>Ayers hosted <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Fusion_FM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fusion FM</a>, one of many in-game radio stations for GTA IV, and he was known for his passionate and exuberant presentation style, and quotes like, "Try to be happy all the time." Some of the songs featured on Fusion FM included Ayers' own "Funk In The Hole," along with tunes like "The Edge" by David McCallum and "Holy Thursday" by David Axelrod.</p><p>You can listen to more of the songs from Fusion FM through the Spotify playlist below.</p><p>Ayers' family <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RoyAyers/posts/pfbid0c4uWZoookuetVWmeuKdhskTEEcBCEYyzfYfsRqmT27iH1tbnASY48GWD83pNZ1bdl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a statement</a> this week confirming he passed away on March 4 in New York City after a long illness. "He lived a beautiful 84 years and will be sorely missed. His family ask that you respect their privacy at this time, a celebration of Roy's life will be forthcoming," the family said.</p><p>"Everybody Loves the Sunshine" is Ayers' most enduringly popular song, and it was sampled more than 100 times by artists like Dr. Dre with his song "My Life" and "The Dream" by Outkast.</p><p>Music is expected to play a major role in the forthcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. It was recently reported that DJ Khaled will have his own in-game radio station in GTA 6. The report went on to say there is potential for other real-life artists to appear in the game as well with their own radio stations. GTA 6 launches this fall for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. </p>
