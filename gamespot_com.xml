                <p>The 1.0 version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a> is here, along with an assortment of questions and vague pointers about one of the biggest mysteries in Early Access. Whether you're jumping into the game for the first time or after being caught up with the story available during Early Access, the task of locating the Three Fates is quite an involved endeavor.</p><p>The launch of Hades 2 allows you to finally move the "Melinoë, Help Us" objective forward, which has been a constant presence in the Fated List of Minor Prophecies. As you'll soon find out, this turns out to be a questline with multiple steps, some of which solving riddles with far from clear answers. If you're wondering how to locate the Three Fates in Hades 2, as well as the answers to the riddles of Melinoë, Seek Us, we have all the answers below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Help_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Help Us in Hades 2</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Remember_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Remember Us in Hades 2</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_Solve_Every_Hades_2_Riddle_in_Melino____Seek_Us">How to Solve Every Hades 2 Riddle in Melinoë, Seek Us</a><ul><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_is_our_emissary">Seek to know he who is our emissary</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_they_who_created_the_world">Seek to know they who created the world</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_cast_us_out">Seek to know he who cast us out</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_she_who_trained_you">Seek to know she who trained you</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_rebels_against_the_gods">Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</a></li><li><a href="#Seek_to_know_he_who_labors_for_the_gods">Seek to know he who labors for the gods</a></li><li><a href="#We_shall_attempt_to_reach_you_thus_again">We shall attempt to reach you thus again</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#How_to_Complete_Melino____Find_Us">How to Complete Melinoë, Find Us</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Help_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Help Us in Hades 2</h2><p>One of the first questions that might come to mind, especially if you were all caught up with the Early Access content ahead of the 1.0 release, is how to actually make progress in the Melinoë, Help Us prophecy.</p><p>The answer involves the main story. In order to move the prophecy forward, you first have to <strong>hit credits in Hades 2</strong>. Doing so involves tackling the Dissolution of Time incantation, as well as locating Entropy. If you need some pointers, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-dissolution-of-time-how-to-get-entropy/1100-6534844/" data-ref-id="1100-6534844">full guide</a> explaining how to get to the very end of the main story.</p><p>As somebody who was up to date with the story available in Early Access before release, here's how it went for me: After completing the main story, <strong>the prophecy updated on its own</strong>. Keep in mind that by this point, Moros should already be in the Crossroads. If you get stuck at any point, make sure to speak to him, as well as Hecate and Chaos, who tend to be the main people discussing the Fates' whereabouts.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571388" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571388"></a><figcaption>You can consider this the epilogue after reaching the credits of Hades 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571388-20250915024323_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Remember_Us_in_Hades_2">How to Complete Melinoë, Remember Us in Hades 2</h2><p>After reaching the credits of Hades 2, you'll gain access to Melinoë, Remember Us in the Fated List of Minor Prophecies. The sole objective here is to investigate the Underworld and Olympus.</p><p>Simply put, the epilogue story component kicks off by encouraging you to continue doing runs. I did three Underworld runs and one Olympus run, and this seems to have completed the objective. During said runs, I spoke to every NPC that had a question mark on them. It seems talking to Chaos was key, too, but it's hard to confirm due to how Hades 2 works.</p><p>Take the run numbers as a ballpark to strive towards, and make sure to always double-check the Fated List of Minor Prophecies whenever you're back at the Crossroads to see if you've completed the objective. Once you do, prepare yourself--the next objective will take a while.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571390" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571390"></a><figcaption>I've been wondering the same thing, Hermes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571390-20250915173244_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Solve_Every_Hades_2_Riddle_in_Melino____Seek_Us">How to Solve Every Hades 2 Riddle in Melinoë, Seek Us</h2><p>Melinoë, Seek Us is easily one of the most confusing objectives in Hades 2. It involves "seeking to know" six characters, and while some of them are easy enough to discern based on the riddle description, it's hard to know exactly how to progress with them.</p><p>First, we'll mention the answer to every riddle before explaining what we did for the objective to count in the prophecy itself.</p><ul><li><strong>Seek to know he who is our emissary</strong>: Moros</li><li><strong>Seek to know they who created the world</strong>: Chaos</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who cast us out</strong>: Chronos</li><li><strong>Seek to know she who trained you</strong>: Hecate</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</strong>: Prometheus</li><li><strong>Seek to know he who labors for the gods</strong>: Hermes</li></ul><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_is_our_emissary">Seek to know he who is our emissary</h3><p>This required maxing out the bond with Moros. This means completing all interactions and giving him the gifts he's open to until you reach the Bond Forged status, which adds the Moros icon on top of its Keepsake.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_they_who_created_the_world"><strong>Seek to know they who created the world</strong></h3><p>When we got access to Melinoë, Seek Us, this objective was already completed. We didn't have a full bond with Chaos, but we had a conversation with them that spoke about the Fates. Our recommendation is to plunge into any Chaos Gates you see and gift them nectar until this conversation happens.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_cast_us_out"><strong>Seek to know he who cast us out</strong></h3><p>Once you finish the main story, Chronos will re-appear at the end of the first region during Underworld runs close to the water fountain. We had spoken to him before learning about the new prophecy, and similarly to Chaos, we had this objective completed on its own. You can also pursue a bond with him after you gift him at least one nectar bottle. We didn't need to on our end, but it's a plan B in case this is different on your save file. Still, we don't think you need to max out the bond itself.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_she_who_trained_you"><strong>Seek to know she who trained you</strong></h3><p>This step was odd. Hecate mentioned the Three Fates multiple times as we gave her gifts whenever she was open to them at the Crossroads. Right before the last Bath Salt to reach the Bond Forged status, we activated the Vow of Rivals from the Testaments list, and fought the alternative version of Hecate. After being victorious and completing the Underworld run, we returned to the Crossroads, checked the list, and saw that the objective was completed. If you're stuck upgrading your bond with Hecate, give this a try.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571391"></a><figcaption>Eventually, even Prometheus will ask about the Fates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571391-20250915175918_1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_rebels_against_the_gods"><strong>Seek to know he who rebels against the gods</strong></h3><p>Prometheus doesn't have a bond, and you can only interact with him during the boss encounter in an Olympus run. It took us a couple of runs until he mentioned the Three Fates on his own, and that marked the objective on the list. Again, it's hard to know the exact number.</p><p>At the same time, Heracles also mentioned the Fates during an Olympus run, and he shares similar philosophies to Prometheus. Considering Melinoë, Seek Us is about prominent characters, it's hard to say that you actually need to talk to Heracles instead. But, in case you get absolutely stuck, make sure to give Heracles nectar bottles when you stumble upon him.</p><h3 id="Seek_to_know_he_who_labors_for_the_gods"><strong>Seek to know he who labors for the gods</strong></h3><p>Similar to the previous objective, this riddle can refer to either Hermes or Charon. The latter is the safest option, as he's the de facto worker for the Olympian gods. The thing is, we didn't actually make any progress with his bond. When we got the objective, we had already hit a limit with him, which reads: "Charon may not say no to Ambrosia after earning more Nightmare and using Obol Points to redeem rewards."</p><p>We completed several runs, enabling Testaments to get Nightmare (up to seven, to be exact), and spent Obol Points at the Crossroads whenever the shopkeeper allowed us to. At the same time, we progressed through Hermes' bond. He had a limit as well, in which he would accept Ambrosia "after his immediate concerns subside," and when you "spend enough at his shrines."</p><p>Along with spending money on his shrines whenever we had the chance and the spare change, making progress through the other objectives on the list eventually unlocked this, and allowed us to reach the Bond Forged status. Once we did this, the objective completed itself once we were back at the Crossroads. Meanwhile, Charon's bond remained stuck at the aforementioned lock.</p><p>In short, it's hard to know whether you need Hermes or Charon for this objective. If you can get to the thresholds we outlined, you should be good.</p><h3 id="We_shall_attempt_to_reach_you_thus_again"><strong>We shall attempt to reach you thus again</strong></h3><p>This one is more simple. Once you have all other objectives done and dusted, go ahead and do another run. I went for the Underworld, but it should be indistinct. Then, once you return to the Crossroads, Moros will say something about the Fated List of Minor Prophecies "shaking" while you were out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571386" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571386"></a><figcaption>Almost there!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571386-20250917165810_1.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_Complete_Melino____Find_Us">How to Complete Melinoë, Find Us</h2><p>If you thought you were done, I've got bad news. There's one last objective to tackle before locating the Three Fates in Hades 2.</p><p>Melinoë, Find Us involves the following: "Using our Emissary's gift in the depths of Oceanus, active it thrice in successive chambers, then purposely return to shadow." This is referencing the <strong>Engraved Pin</strong>, which is Moros' Keepsake. Equipping it makes it so that when you fall to 0 HP in an encounter, you become doomed. If you clear the encounter in 10 seconds, you're brought back to life.</p><p>For this, you'll have to do an Underworld run, and get to Oceanus, the second region. Melinoë will mention something about the Fates when you set foot on it. The trick is that you must make it far into an encounter without beating it, let yourself get killed, complete the 10-second challenge, and repeat two more times in subsequent rooms. So, do this in one room, pick a room that will have an enemy encounter rather than a shop or an NPC interaction, repeat, then do the same a third time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571387" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571387"></a><figcaption>Melinoë will likely mention the Fates upon entering Oceanus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4571387-20250917172653_1.jpg"></figure><p>Here's how it went for us: We started this right from the very first room available. The key is to try and pick enemies one by one until there's only one or two left, just to see if there's another wave incoming or not. If not, then let yourself get hit until you reach 0 HP, and swiftly take down the remaining enemies.</p><p>After completing three encounters having succeeded in the Engraved Pin challenge, we jumped into a fourth enemy room and repeated the same process, only this time we didn't fight back to reach a defeat state. Now, since the previous step in the Fates questline involved maxing out the bond with Moros, we encountered a romance scene instead. So, we had to repeat everything again in another run.</p><p>If successful, "return to shadow now" will lead to a cutscene related to the Three Fates. This culminates the questline, and you can cash in the reward back at the Crossroads, which is three Nightmares. If you're having trouble with this challenge, deactivating any Death Defiances you have and solely relying on the Engraved Pin helped on my end.

                <p>Earlier this year, One More Level--the developer behind the cyberpunk action title Ghostrunner--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghostrunner-devs-reveal-next-game-a-first-person-souls-like-set-during-the-napoleonic-wars/1100-6534021/" data-ref-id="1100-6534021">debuted their next title</a>, a first-person action-souls-like called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valor-mortis/" data-ref-id="5000-691455">Valor Mortis</a>. Gamescom attendees were able to play it in August, but next month, Valor Mortis is getting a playtest that's open to everyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxjGXZ7Bv8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_kxjGXZ7Bv8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The public playtest for Valor Mortis will be held from October 6-13. Fans who want to participate are invited to sign up on <a href="https://valormortis.firstlook.gg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official site</a>. The playtest features the first chapter of the game's pre-alpha build, which introduces the world and its story while giving you 10 possible levels of progression as you make their way past a mini boss. If you make it that far, a main boss is waiting to fight you while giving you a chance to demonstrate what you've learned. You can also access the first section of the upgrade tree.</p><p>One More Level and Lyrical Games will be sponsoring community contests during the playtest, including speedruns, screenshot contests, and fan art. Players who take part in those challenges will earn a chance to win prize packs when the game launches.</p><p>Valor Mortis may remind some players of the Dishonored series, due to its first-person action and period setting. Although the game is set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars in the 19th century, it doesn't take place in our world. Instead, it's a twisted version of our reality where a newly discovered substance called Nephtogolobin horribly mutates the living and the dead.</p><p>The game places players in control of of William, one of Napoleon's former soldiers, as the Nephtogolobin gives him the ability to rise from his grave multiple times. He's going to need that power to make it past his former comrades, most of whom now look like undead monsters.</p><p>GameSpot had a chance <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/valor-mortis-hands-on-impressions/2300-6466294/" data-ref-id="2300-6466294">to play Valor Mortis</a> earlier this year, and the first impressions were very promising. Valor Mortis is available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2828710/Valor_Mortis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and it will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 in 2026.</p>

                <p>Embracer Group CEO Phil Rogers has commented on AI in gaming, saying it's the "most powerful technology tool of our generation" and one that the company wants to deploy strategically.</p><p>During an investor meeting recently <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/embracer-group-ai-fellowship-phil-rogers?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported on by Game File</a>, Rogers said, "Players aren't longing for generic, soulless side quests or synthetic AI voices." He's very bullish on AI technologies and how they may be able to help developers with things like "driving efficiency, and ultimately delivering the high quality, memorable games our players demand."</p><p>Rogers went on to say he is aware of the "concern from players and developers alike" about AI, but in his belief, a greater risk is using AI "without a strong ethical framework."</p><p>"Artists, actors, writers need protection from plagiarism" that could result from AI, he added. "Our developers will always have the final creative control and authorship. Transparency is mandatory. We're committed to being transparent with players about how, where we use AI in our dev process."</p><p>Rogers said Embracer is establishing "strict governance" around generative AI, including "controls," "audit logs," and "workflow approvals."</p><p>The executive went on to say that Embracer's teams have already begun to see "measurable increases in productivity" thanks to the use of generative AI technology. For example, a motion-capture shoot that previously took seven days to complete can now be done in half the time, he said. Embracer's AI technologies have also allowed developers to check code for bugs in real time, and that 2D artwork can be transformed into a "game-ready 3D model" in hours now, instead of days.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of developers globally already use AI technologies in game development</a>, despite ongoing and serious concerns raised by developers about it. Recently, Smash Bros. boss Masahiro Sakurai said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA game development is becoming unsustainable, and that using AI can help.</a></p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p><p>Embracer in recent times has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-canceled-29-games-and-laid-off-1400-people-in-just-the-last-six-months/1100-6521108/" data-ref-id="1100-6521108">enacted mass layoffs, canceled games, and closed studios. </a></p>
