                <p dir="ltr">Flashbang grenades are meant to disorient your foes. Instead, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players have discovered that using them to blind your teammates will net you 15 XP. It's a farming trick that promotes bad cooperation.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Expel posted a video of the XP exploit <a href="https://x.com/iamExpel/status/1851710616320295358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851710616320295358%7Ctwgr%5Ef633b41a8d558e587331c79028b5f75ddab84bb1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fcall-of-duty-black-ops-6s-hottest-new-xp-farming-trick-has-players-flashbanging-their-allies-for-a-measly-15xp%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>, adding that throwing flashbang grenades at allies "gives you XP" and "do with this information what you will." The UI text on screen states, "Flashed Enemy," so it seems likely this is an unintended benefit for being a terrible teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/" data-ref-id="1100-6527292">progression and prestige is a core tenet of Black Ops 6</a>, on top of the rewards and unlockables in multiplayer. As such, there will always be players looking for easy ways to level up. For instance, the original Destiny famously had a loot cave for farming a decade ago, when people mindlessly shot at a cavern for hours on end. That exploit was addressed but ended up leading to an in-game dungeon acknowledging the loot cave. </p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launched a week ago and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">saw a record-setting debut</a>. The new entry in the FPS franchise had the "biggest" three-day opening weekend for Call of Duty in regard to total players, hours played, and total matches. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-spiked-call-of-duty-to-a-bonkers-day-on-xbox/1100-6527515/" data-ref-id="1100-6527515">debut of Black Ops 6 also led to a "bonkers" day of engagement for Call of Duty HQ</a>--the app housing the game along with Warzone and Modern Warfare 3. Over half of all Xbox Series X|S owners checked out Call of Duty HQ on October 28, while over a third of all PS5 owners did the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">iconic Nuketown multiplayer map arrives in Black Ops 6</a>. This is the original arena from Black Ops set in the 1950s, instead of a new variation. Looking ahead, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/" data-ref-id="1100-6527474">Black Ops 6 Season 1 has been confirmed to begin November 14</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer review</a>.</p>

                <p>The exact number of PlayStation 3 consoles that were ever produced has been revealed, according to a current Sony employee.</p><p>In what started as a discussion on Twitter about the PS3's infamous boomerang controller, a Sony programmer responded that they had walked past the controller in Sony's Japan headquarters recently and that it was located on the 16th floor near a coffee machine.</p><p>The employee took a picture of the boomerang controller in the display case, and on the shelf under it, there was a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/88-159-116-units-of-playstation-3-consoles-were-produced.1024860/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 console marked with the words</a>, "In memory of PS3 last production. Manufactured 88,159,116 pcs. Period: Oct 2006 - June 2016."</p><p>So there you have it. It seems like a little over 88 million PS3 consoles were ever manufactured over a period of almost 10 years. The last official sales figure for the <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 was around 87.4 million</a> consoles sold as of March 2017.</p><p>Last year, former Sony president Shawn Layden confirmed the exact number of <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1707563288178135099" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSP units manufactured</a>, showing a unit with the same phrasing as the PS3 one seen in the Sony employee's photo.</p><p>PS3 games can still be played today on modern hardware through PlayStation Plus, but only by streaming them. Users have been clamoring for some sort of native backwards compatibility with PS3 games. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-developing-ps3-emulation-for-select-titles-on-ps5-report/1100-6524478/" data-ref-id="1100-6524478">rumors floating around about emulation</a> on PS5, but it's unclear if it'll ever be delivered due to the PS3's unique architecture.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is BioWare's biggest launch on Steam, reaching the top spot on Steam's sales charts and knocking down Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1845910/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Dragon Age: The Veilguard has peaked at 70,414 concurrent players within the first 24 hours of its release. This beats out BioWare's previous record of 59,817 concurrent players for Mass Effect: Legendary Edition.</p><p>BioWare put extra effort into making sure the PC version of Dragon Age: The Veilguard was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-be-steam-deck-verified-and-wont-require-ea-app/1100-6525301/" data-ref-id="1100-6525301">up to snuff on Steam.</a> The game is verified on Steam Deck, and passes Valve's internal tests on inputs, display, performance, and seamlessness. A technical breakdown of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjawnIC81nE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC version by Digital Foundry</a> revealed it to be an excellent port, which is often not the case at launch for major game releases on PC.</p><p>It also doesn't require players to use the EA App (the successor to Origin) to play it on PC. Previous EA games required users to play them on the EA App, so this marks a big shift in EA's launch strategy. However, players to agree to a third-party EULA, as noted by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>.</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is now available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>, we said, "The Veilguard feels like BioWare making a good BioWare game again, and that in itself makes me extraordinarily happy."</p>
