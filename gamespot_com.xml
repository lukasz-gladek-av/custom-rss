                <p>Neurable and HyperX are teaming up to develop a gaming headset designed to help you play better. How will it do this? With an "industry-first neurotechnology-powered" headset that can potentially improve focus and accuracy in competitive games. It's also designed to use "non-invasive" neurotechnology, so you don't have to worry about getting a few cybernetic upgrades to be compatible with the device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426"></a><figcaption>HyperX and Neurable's headset concept</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630470,1300-4630471" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"></figure><p>Neurable and HyperX claim that testing with the in-development headset has resulted in faster reaction times of up to 38 milliseconds, improved accuracy by 3%, and a higher number of targets were hit during FPS training tasks when tested on esports players. The headset uses neural-sensing technology to track metrics like cognitive load and stress from a user's brainwaves.</p><p>The AI-powered earpad sensors monitor EEG signals from your head, but it's worth noting that this isn't a magic bullet that will instantly improve your performance. You'll need to use the data from your sessions and training exercises to improve your ability to focus better during games.</p><p>Don't expect the headset to be out anytime soon, as it's still in a very early stage of development.

On top of that, your save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, meaning your lengthy adventure can start early for the RPG remake.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unknown how much content is in the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined demo to check out. However, Square Enix is promising <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that players will receive Maribel's Day Off Dress as a reward in the full game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Play the free demo for DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined starting January 7th on Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam!<br>You'll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on February 5, 2026. ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/8sN8UeyFmP" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/8sN8UeyFmP</a></p>  — DRAGON QUEST (@DragonQuest) <a href="https://twitter.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">This is the second month in a row that Square Enix is offering up a demo for a big-name RPG. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-you-can-start-playing-final-fantasy-7-remake-right-now-on-switch-2-and-xbox/1100-6537002/">a demo arrived for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S</a>, with that full game set to release later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII originally came out in 2000 for PlayStation, followed by a North American release in 2001. The RPG has been remade before with a 3DS version in 2013, so Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the game's second time for a glow-up. This time, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-fixes-the-originals-painful-slog/1100-6536315/">hopes to address the original's "painful" slog</a>. For instance, the director has implied that this remake wants to get players into the action much more quickly, so this demo should give us a glimpse at that aspect of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. </p><p>Set to launch February 5, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will be available on PC, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preorder-guide/1100-6534719/">Preorders are up</a> for the game, including bonuses for doing so. In addition, this year marks the 40th anniversary for the Dragon Quest franchise.</p>
