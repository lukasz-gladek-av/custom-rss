                <p>BioShock fans may be understandably curious about the fate of the next game in the series following leaks that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">BioShock 4 failed an internal review</a> and Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore was reportedly ousted by 2K Games as a result. However, Strauss Zelnick--the CEO of 2K Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive--has essentially promised fans that BioShock 4 is still on the way and it won't be canceled.</p><p>"It's going to come out," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That I can say hand on heart, without question ... We don't talk about how long our development cycles are. We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on BioShock because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That's always challenging. We think we're up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless."</p><p>The same report that noted BioShock 4's latest setback also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">a remake of the original BioShock was canceled</a> earlier this year. 2K Games acknowledged the original report and called Cloud Chamber's BioShock 4 "good game," but reiterated its commitment "to delivering a great one."</p><p>There hasn't been a new game in the BioShock series since 2013's BioShock Infinite, and a proposed BioShock movie has also had difficulty breaking out of development. Francis Lawrence is attached to direct BioShock at Netflix, and he recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p><p>As for BioShock creator Ken Levine, his next title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, remains in development at Ghost Story and it will eventually be published by Take-Two. However, a release date for Judas has yet to be announced.</p>

                <p>This year's Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios in California and Universal Orlando in Florida will feature haunted houses devoted to Fallout and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-universal-halloween-horror-nights-teaser-features-some-familiar-faces/1100-6533541/" data-ref-id="1100-6533541">Five Nights At Freddy's</a>--and while both are inspired by video games, both houses will lean into their respective live-action adaptations.</p><p>The theme parks haven't shared any of the footage of this year's HHN houses yet, but the creative team on both coasts has offered a few teasers about what fans can expect to see.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/halloween-horror-nights-houses-fallout-terrifier-five-nights-at-freddys-1236339724/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Universal revealed that Amazon Prime's Fallout series provided the HHN team with 3D models of Walton Goggins' The Ghoul to ensure that masks used in the attraction are identical to his face on the show. Universal Orlando's Lora Sauls also said that a teaser has been filmed, with "one of their characters for us to tease their second season in the house."</p><p>Universal Orlando's Mike Aiello added that the Fallout house will be a montage of different locations from the show and the games, with appearances by Lucy (played by Ella Purnell in the series), The Ghoul, Maximus (played by Aaron Moten in the series), and a 500-pound animatronic bear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPC6syuNU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OWPC6syuNU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking of animatronics, the Five Nights At Freddy's house will feature full-size animatronic recreations of Freddy Fazbear and his pals as created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Universal Hollywood's John Murdy called them "the most complicated animatronic figures that weâ€™ve ever done" for HHN. He added that guests will "see a fully animated Freddy Fazbear performing like he would in the movie or the video game" in a convincing recreation of the pizzeria that serves as the setting for the games and movies. Even the game's famous security room will be a part of the attraction.</p><p>Universal Orlando will kick off the Halloween festivities with Five Nights At Freddy's on August 29, while Universal Studios will wait a little longer and start the FNAF event on September 4. Halloween Horror Nights on both coasts will run until November 2.</p>

                <p>No backdoors, no kill switches, no spyware. That's Nvidia's pledge after an accusation from the Cyberspace Administration of China, which asked Nvidia last week to provide documents about security vulnerabilities in Nvidia's H20 data center GPUs, specifically citing "backdoor" security risks. Nvidia responded officially <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/no-backdoors-no-kill-switches-no-spyware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with a blog post</a> the company's chief security officer, David Reber Jr.</p><p>"Embedding backdoors and kill switches into chips would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors," Reber wrote. "It would undermine global data infrastructure and fracture trust in U.S. technology. Established law wisely requires companies to fix vulnerabilities--not create them."</p><p>The Cyberspace Administration of China's concerns stem specifically from the Nvidia's H20 GPU, which is made for the Chinese market and designed to comply with US export guidelines. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/08/nvidia-blasts-proposals-for-chip-backdoors-as-us-considers-kill-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica notes</a> that U.S. lawmakers are considering a Chip Security Act that would "require exported chips to be built with 'location verification,'" and "calls for an assessment of mechanisms to stop unauthorized use." In other words, a kill switch.</p><p>If you've watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lockpickinglawyer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lockpicking Lawyer</a> on YouTube for even a couple of minutes, you know there's no such thing as a lock that can't be picked--just ones that require more specialized tools. The same goes for hardware backdoors. Once there's a door there, someone will find a way to walk through it. Something as ubiquitous as Nvidia GPUs, which populate data centers and consumer PCs all over the world, makes for an especially appealing target.</p><p>Reber cites the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip#Technical_vulnerabilities" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clipper Chip Debacle</a>," in which the NSA and U.S. government pushed for a chip to be installed in telecommunications devices that would allow backdoor access through an encrypted key. Launched in 1993, security experts found multiple vulnerabilities in the next couple of years, and the chip fell out of favor before it was ever adopted.</p><p>"Security researchers discovered fundamental flaws in the system that could allow malicious parties to tamper with the software," and "that created central vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries." In other words, this kind of backdoor access might give the U.S. government access to GPUs, but it would also give other governments and other malicious actors access as well, with some effort.</p><p>"Some point to smartphone features like 'find my phone'... as models for a GPU kill switch," Reber continued, explaining that those are user-controlled software options. "Hardwiring a kill switch is something entirely different: a permanent flaw beyond user control, and an open invitation to disaster... That's not sound policy. It's an overreaction that would irreparably harm America's economic and national security interests."</p><p>"For decades, policymakers have championed industryâ€™s efforts to create secure, trustworthy hardware," Reber wrote. "Governments have many tools to protect nations, consumers and the economy. Deliberately weakening critical infrastructure should never be one of them."</p>

                <p>There's been a lot of speculation about the cost of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, with some companies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">hoping that it will debut at $100</a> to open the door for more games to drop at that price. The current ceiling for gaming prices appears to be $80, but Strauss Zelnick--the CEO of Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive--doesn't seem to be very enthusiastic about raising the price for GTA 6.</p><p>"I think our approach may be a little bit different," replied Zelnick when asked about pricing GTA 6 at $80 during Take-Two's August 7 investor call. "We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing. So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>"Variable pricing has been the nature of this industry forever," added Zelnick. "You know, most Frontline releases will go out at a higher price, sometimes with special editions, and then over time usually the price is discounted to optimize for the largest possible market. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon ... The rubric that informs us is really that of delivering more value than what we charge."</p><p>Earlier this week, Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott laid out a similar argument about why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">it's a bad idea to launch GTA 6 at $100</a>. Elliot suggests that GTA Online is the real cash cow for the franchise, and Rockstar can't risk alienating the players who have stayed with the game for well over a decade now. He also noted that a higher price point raises the risk of players sticking with GTA 5 over its much-anticipated sequel.</p><p>In other GTA news, former Rockstar employee--and longtime in-game DJ--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-unlikely-to-feature-this-longtime-in-game-radio-host/1100-6533727/" data-ref-id="1100-6533727">Lazlow Jones recently revealed he's unlikely to return for GTA 6</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-could-carry-forward-this-feature-from-gta-5/1100-6532421/" data-ref-id="1100-6532421">real-world musicians may still have a few radio stations of their own</a> in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

                <p>Reanimal is an upcoming horror game for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC, created by Tarsier Studios, the folks responsible for the Little Nightmares series. It follows a brother and sister as they explore a mysterious island in search of their missing friends, discovering all sorts of mutated animals and other abominations along the way. Based on the brief glimpses we've seen of the game through trailers, there's a strong emphasis on its chilling atmosphere and surviving tense moments. Reanimal does not yet have a release date, though <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FKWMRB5M,B0FKWDMYH8,B0FKWP7N5P,B0FKWRQZZZ,B0FKW5HRBK,B0FKWBTJNW,B0FKVZVK5D,B0FKW5LN3X,B0FKWMP4XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are open at most retailers. Three versions of the game are up for grabs, including a $40 standard edition, $60 Deluxe Edition, and a massive $200 Collector's Edition that's packed with physical extras.</p><h2>Reanimal Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Since Reanimal doesn't yet have a firm release date, details about preorder bonuses are scarce.

Cronos is shaping up to be another nightmare-inducing adventure with a sci-fi twist that looks unlike anything the studio has made. Cronos takes place in a futuristic rendition of Eastern Europe where an event known as The Change has radically altered the landscape, which is now stalked by horrific, mutating creatures. Players take the role of the Traveler, who searches the twisted environment for rifts that connect back to 1980s Poland so they can rescue key people from the past on behalf of a mysterious group known as The Collective. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cronos-PlayStation-5/dp/B0FKNMXH4V?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorders</a> are open ahead of its September 5 release, with two editions up for grabs--including a $60 standard edition and a $70 Deluxe Edition--both of which include their own exclusive extras. On top of that, preorders come with a selection of additional in-game content, as well as up to 48-hour early access to the game depending on which version you buy.</p><h2>Cronos: The New Dawn Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545980-cronospreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545980" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545980-cronospreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545980"></a><figcaption>Cronos: The New Dawn standard edition physical preorder bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545980-cronospreorders.jpg"></figure><p>Cronos: The New Dawn has several preorder perks available.

<section><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers.</p></section>

                <p>Since its announcement earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 has seemingly met just as much skepticism as excitement. Yes, after over a decade, we <em>finally </em>have a new Ninja Gaiden--but with Team Ninja and Platinum Games collaborating on its development and Microsoft publishing, is the series' identity at stake? It's a question that's been on many long-time fans' minds, as well as my own.</p><p dir="ltr">After all, there's no denying that some of what makes Ninja Gaiden such a beloved series are the little quirks we overlook out of affection. And, more often than not, these are the very same friction-inducing qualities that are promptly removed when a series is remade or rebooted. At the same time, does opting to retain each and every one of these qualities prevent the game from evolving, or becoming an exciting, modern entry-point? After spending around four hours with Ninja Gaiden 4 and speaking with the team behind it at Platinum Game's Tokyo office, I've come to a preliminary conclusion: Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ninja Gaiden 4 Is Exactly The Ninja Gaiden Game You're Hoping It Will Be | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Flexible and fluid</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">More so than previous entries in the series, Ninja Gaiden 4 emphasizes flexibility. If you're a Ninja Gaiden veteran who loathes the idea of executing perfect dodges, locking on to enemies, and watching your Karma--the game's scoring system that rewards players for executing combos--rack up in the top left corner, you can either ignore or remove all of it. At the same time, these options, an impressively robust accessibility menu, and the game's beginner-friendly Hero mode--which auto-blocks most incoming damage--make the game extremely approachable for new audiences and those who might have been turned off by the series' brutal reputation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That said, you'd be wrong to dismiss Ninja Gaiden 4 itself as easy. Much like previous titles, Master Ninja mode is brutal, with higher difficulties bringing increased enemy intelligence and toughness, as well as more challenging enemy staging. However, the existence of one mode of play doesn't negate the existence of the other, and thus Ninja Gaiden 4 feels wonderfully malleable.</p><p dir="ltr">"While it is true that Ninja Gaiden 4 does include these new parry mechanics and also just dodges, they're not necessarily required for you to overcome. You don't have to lean on them exclusively. They're just another addition to the wide toolset that you have available," Ninja Gaiden 4 co-director Masakazu Hirayama said. "Ninja Gaiden 4 isn't necessarily more of a defensive game than the past Ninja Gaiden titles. They're just a wider array of tools at your disposal and the effort to give players as much controllability and playability as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"And while it may seem at first glance that the defensive techniques such as the parry and just dodge are very powerful, you might have noticed that there's this berserk gauge, and that gauge will actually decrease if you're being too defensive," he continued. "The combat is designed in a way for you to have to really engage with that back-and-forth, that high-speed back-and-forth between offense and defense."</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, this design choice reflects a larger theme in Ninja Gaiden 4: the merging of the old and the new. Ninja Gaiden 4 makes a very conscious effort to respect long-time fans, former protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, and Team Ninja's original vision. At the same time, the introduction of Platinum Games as co-developer, new protagonist Yakumo, and a vastly expanded tool kit highlight the fact that this is, in fact, a reinvention. And though this has always been the case with the Ninja Gaiden series, even 4's setting--which sees cyberpunk elements and traditional Japanese qualities come together to form a moody, cyber-ninja dystopia--exemplifies this dynamic.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet despite Ninja Gaiden being known for its brutality, this collision isn't violent. Instead, all these different components complement each other and ultimately highlight what each aspect brings to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Yakumo vs. Ryu</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">This dynamic is perhaps most obvious when switching between the game's main characters, Yakumo and Ryu. During this preview, I finally got the chance to see how a slightly older Ryu controls. While he and Yakumo are similar mechanically and can even execute some of the same moves, there are clear distinctions in how they control. Yakumo feels lighter, faster, and dare I say a bit edgier, thanks to his Bloodraven form and ability to enter a berserk state. Ryu, on the other hand, packs a harder punch, feels more professional and precise, and comes with some of his classic Ninpo Arts in lieu of a new winged form, adding to the sense that he is truly a master ninja at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to design a character that would contrast with Ryu Hayabusa," Hirayama said. "Ryu Hayabusa is already the apex of super ninja status, and Yakumo is this young ninja prodigy who's starting to climb the ranks."</p><p dir="ltr">"If I were to distill the differences between the two characters into one word, Ryu is powerful, whereas Yakumo is clever," co-director Yuji Nakao added. "Both characters can utilize legacy abilities, whether it's the Izuna Drop or the Flying Swallow. But there are these elements that really distinguish the characters in these really subtle but very noticeable ways."</p><p dir="ltr">Another major difference between Yakumo and Ryu that reinforces these design principles is the fact that while Ryu sticks to his trusty blade, Yakumo has a handful of weapons to choose from, with some being more experimental than others. We were introduced to Yakumo's drill weapon, which allows him to plunge into enemies and, well, drill; it's silly, satisfying, and, like I said, he's certainly the edgier of the two, so it tracks. Another reason why Yakumo has multiple weapons, however, is simply because he is Ninja Gaiden 4's primary protagonist, so don't expect the same level of treatment--or number of chapters--for both characters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"There are dedicated chapters for Ryu Hayabusa in the story of the game. In terms of the ratio, it leans more towards Yakumo since he is the protagonist," Hiriyama said. "But after you beat the game, it will unlock Chapter Challenge, where you can play all the chapters as Ryu Hayabusa. Likewise, can play as Yakumo in Hayabusa's dedicated chapters."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately during my preview, Platinum took the liberty of unlocking the game's Chapter Challenge mode, meaning I got to take both Yakumo and Ryu through the handful of included chapters, challenges, and boss fights. Doing so further drove home the differences between Yakumo and Ryu, as with Ryu I noticed that I completed objectives more quickly, but with Yakumo I had more combo-building fun. Both characters felt equally viable and fun to use, hopefully meaning that players won't dread playing through chapters that are initially bound to a certain character.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Bullet hell boss battles, cyberpunk cities</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">After going through the game's first chapters and completing a few challenges, I opted to face off against two of Ninja Gaiden 4's first bosses: a lightning sword-wielding commander and the Kitsune Cortesean. Though neither one was abnormally brutal, both offered up the same vital lesson: Unless you're playing on Hero mode, you cannot get through this game if you're just button-mashing. Whereas the fights your ninjas stumble into can be overwhelming thanks to the sheer number of strong and intuitive enemies tossed your way, these bosses were overwhelmingly powerful, and thus required me to pay attention, learn attack patterns, and intentionally move about the arena while utilizing my environment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I had a great time with both of these enemies. Each felt appropriately challenging on normal difficulty and were immensely satisfying to take down. That said, traversing my environment while doing so was not as enjoyable. Due to Ninja Gaiden 4's arena sizes, I frequently found myself a bit annoyed as I tried to grapple to safety only to be just out of reach of one of the designated grappling areas. Granted, some of this could be attributed to user error, and large arenas are necessary considering Platinum (naturally) adds some of its iconic bullet hell-style combat moments to the game, such as in the Kitsune Cortesean fight. That said, it still felt a bit stilted and made traversal feel slightly less fluid for me.</p><p dir="ltr">The locations I explored in Ninja Gaiden 4 didn't vary too much from one another visually. All of them were set in a rain-drenched, dystopian Tokyo, and lean into cyberpunk visuals, complete with shadows, grime, and neon lights. That said--and although I would have loved to see variation in environments to help break things up--those included in the preview were striking and featured plenty of vistas, cinematic imagery, and interesting set pieces, such as the gargantuan, floating dragon skeleton that ensnares the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was ultimately reassured by both the introduction of traditional Japanese elements as the story unfolds and the game's directors that not all of Ninja Gaiden 4 will take place in Tokyo's gritty underbelly. According to Hiriyama, Yakumo and Ryu will get the chance to dismember their enemies in more natural environments, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"The game itself takes place within the greater Tokyo area, but within that area there are also stages other than the cyberpunk aesthetic," Hiriyama said. "There are stages set in more natural environments, such as forests or caves. There's other environments as well. If you notice in Stage 1-3 of the build, you might have noticed that there's more of this traditional Japanese aesthetic in the stage environment, so you can expect that kind of variety in the full game."</p><p dir="ltr">That being the case, I'm certainly excited to see more of Ninja Gaiden 4's Tokyo. But what I'm most anticipating about its full release is something the Ninja Gaiden series' isn't typically praised for: its story and characters.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Unlikely allies--and enemies</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">It's still early days, but I am intrigued by the story Ninja Gaiden 4 is setting up. Though nothing of particular interest happens in the game's first chapter--which, it should be noted, is the same one that was revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest--Ninja Gaiden's prologue establishes several fun relationship dynamics. For starters, Yakumo is a member of the Raven Clan, a rival clan to Ryu's Hayabusa Clan. Things are further complicated when we discover that, in the seven years since Ryu essentially failed to completely kill the dragon whose corpse hangs over Tokyo and causes the city's blighted rain, he has since aligned himself with the Divine Dragon Order, the Raven Clan's enemy. As such, when Ryu and Yakumo finally might, it seems likely it will be as enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The prologue also introduces us to Ninja Gaiden 4's main heroine, the Dragon Priestess Seori. It took me all of one scene to completely adore her and the dynamic she has with Yakumo. Whereas Yakumo is quiet, edgy, and serious, Seori is filled with confidence, charm, and humor, making their forced pairing excruciating for him--even if she is exceptionally pretty. On the surface, their relationship feels a lot like Cloud and Aerith's from Final Fantasy 7, so naturally, I'm eager to see where things go.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for me (and all you extremely patient Ninja Gaiden fans), we won't be waiting much longer to see how things play out. Ninja Gaiden 4 is scheduled to release on October 21 and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you're an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, Ninja Gaiden 4 will be available to play at no additional cost on day one.</p>
