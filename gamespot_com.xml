                <p>Big video games take a lot of money to make, but the industry is very secretive in exactly how much is spent developing them. However, it looks like we might have some insight on how much money it takes to make and market a Call of Duty game.</p><p>In a court filing reviewed by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/call-of-duty-budgets-development-costs-black-ops-modern-warfare" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, Activision's head Call of Duty creative Patrick Kelly reportedly revealed the total budgets and copies sold for three Call of Duty games. 2015's Black Ops III reportedly took developer Treyarch over three years to make and cost $450 million, with the total number of copies sold being 43 million.</p><p>For 2019's Modern Warfare, developed by Infinity Ward, the total cost of development was reportedly $640 million with 41 million copies sold. The last one is Black Ops Cold War from 2020. Treyarch and Raven Software's joint project reportedly took $700 million to develop and sold 30 million copies.</p><p>The court filing was reportedly filed on December 23 as part of a response to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/uvalde-families-file-lawsuit-against-activision-and-meta/1100-6523731/" data-ref-id="1100-6523731">lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard</a> regarding the Robb Elementary shooting in Uvalde, Texas back in 2022. The Uvalde lawsuit was filed in May 2024 and claimed that Call of Duty played a part in influencing the mass shooter. Kelly reportedly cited those three specific Call of Duty games as they were the ones that the survivors claimed the shooter played.</p><p>The video game industry still remains tight-lipped about development budgets. In 2023, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-2-and-horizon-forbidden-west-budgets-revealed-by-accident-and-they-werent-cheap/1100-6515551/" data-ref-id="1100-6515551">document surfaced</a> that showed Sony spent $220 million to develop The Last of Us Part 2 and $212 million for Horizon Forbidden West.</p>

new dock is one of several announcements from Razer today at CES 2025. Other highlights include the Razer Blade 16 laptop--an ultra-thin gaming device equipped with a 240Hz OLED display and an AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor. Other interesting reveals include the new PC Remote Play feature coming to the Razer Nexus mobile app--this will let users stream PC gameplay directly to their iOS and Android mobile devices--and Project Arielle, a gaming chair that features integrated heating and cooling technology.</p><p>Using the Razer Fujin Pro mesh gaming chair as a base, Project Arielle uses a bladeless fan system to efficiently deliver an adjustable airflow to its user. Other new Razer products on the way include RGB light bars that offer both front-facing and rear-projecting lighting options, the Iskur V2 X gaming chair priced at $300, and the 19.7-inch Razer Monitor Stand that is equipped with built-in USB and HDMI ports.</p>

                <p>CES 2025 is officially underway, and one of the big gaming announcements so far was a partnership between Nvidia and Krafton for AI-powered teammates who can help you in battle in PUBG.</p><p>Nvidia and Krafton created what they are calling CPCs, or co-playable characters. These characters use artificial intelligence to fight alongside you. This feature is called called PUBG Ally, and the CPC is apparently smart enough to play like a human would. You can say something like, "Hey Ally, I'm looking for a level 3 vest and 5.56 ammo." The CPC will then search the map and try to find it for you. The PUBG Ally can also spot enemies and cover you, locate nearby vehicles, and speak back to you with an AI-powered voice. You can see some of the test footage in action below.</p><p>Note that what you're seeing in the video is representative of R&amp;D gameplay. The PUBG Ally feature <a href="https://x.com/PUBG/status/1876554285745606665" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hasn't actually been greenlit yet</a> and may never come to PUBG.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Transform solo gameplay into a seamless team experience with PUBG Ally. 🎮<br>KRAFTON and NVIDIA have teamed up to create the world’s first Co-Playable Character (CPC), built with NVIDIA ACE.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2025?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2025</a> <a href="https://t.co/jAaibitkgq" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/jAaibitkgq</a></p>  — NVIDIAGameDev (@NVIDIAGameDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGameDev/status/1876509202031444011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Krafton's Sims-like inZOI will also make use of this new CPC feature, though no footage or any other details were revealed as of yet. Naraka: Bladepoint's mobile version will use CPCs as well.</p><p>It appears what was announced here is more of an outline for what could be possible down the road--not something that's ready right now. Krafton CEO CH Kim said this new AI technology will "revolutionize the gaming industry," while Nvidia boss Keita Iida said, "AI is transforming the way games are created and played."</p><p>Plenty of people remain skeptical about how AI could actually shake up video games, in part because AI is nothing new at all in the world of gaming.
