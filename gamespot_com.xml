                <p>World of Warcraft lead producer Raymond Bartos has left Blizzard to join Riot, where he will work on the League of Legends developer's upcoming MMO.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bartos said</a>, "I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started." Serving as a senior game producer, Bartos said his job will be to "help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p><p>Additionally, Bartos said he's excited to join another former WoW developer, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/orlando-salvatore-03772915/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orlando Salvatore</a>, at Riot. "Given our track record on World of Warcraft, I have a feeling we'll be moving fast on day one," Bartos said.</p><p>He joins Riot following the developer's announcement in 2024 that it was resetting its MMO project, saying it will go back to the drawing board and stay silent for "years to come" as it reshaped the project. The MMO was originally announced as a League of Legends game set in the world of Runeterra. The game had been in the works since at least 2020 prior to its "reset" in 2024.</p><p>As announced previously, ex-Bioware and EA developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fcondominas/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fabrice Condominas</a> is serving as the game's new executive producer.</p><p>Riot had always expected its MMO project to take time to materialize. The game's former executive producer, WoW veteran Greg Street, said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-guarantee-league-of-legends-mmo-will-ship-producer-says-but-development-is-going-super-well/1100-6502412/" data-ref-id="1100-6502412">"no guarantee" the game would ever be released</a>, as the team wouldn't ship a game it thought would "disappoint players." Street left Riot in March 2023 after nine years with the company to start his own studio, Fantastic Pixel Castle, which is now making a AAA MMORPG under the codename Ghost, funded by NetEase.</p><p>Riot has also been in the news lately regarding the game Hytale. The company canceled the game in 2025, but its original developer bought the rights from Riot and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-is-off-to-quite-the-strong-start-with-impressive-twitch-viewership-numbers/1100-6537390/" data-ref-id="1100-6537390">released the game just recently to big success.</a></p><p>And in other MMO news, Amazon Games just announced that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-big-mmo-that-started-strong-is-shutting-down/1100-6537436/" data-ref-id="1100-6537436">MMO New World will shut down in January 2027.</a></p>

                <p>For the first time in series history, the Halo franchise will be<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696"> playable on PlayStation this year</a> with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. Executive producer Damon Conn said in an interview that Microsoft's goal is to "bring players back together."</p><p>"There are people who have never been exposed to Halo. Maybe they've always been on <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/tag/sony/" rel="nofollow ">Sony</a> products, switched consoles at a certain point, or just missed it at the time. We want to bring players back together," Conn explained to GamesRadar.</p><p>Creative director Max Szlagor added that, "Halo is best played when we have a large, healthy community."</p><p>Releasing Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5 is a "way to grow, expand, and reconnect the Halo community," Szlagor said.</p><p>"We want to honor the Halo legacy on PlayStation, and we're paving the way to expand our Halo universe--that's how we see it," Conn added. "And it's not a small thing. We don't and we won't take it lightly. We definitely feel the weight of it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjbIM0iegY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Releasing Halo on PS5 is also a way for Microsoft to make a lot of money potentially. After all, Microsoft has already earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-xbox-game-just-passed-300-million-in-revenue-on-ps5-report-says/1100-6537323/" data-ref-id="1100-6537323">hundreds of millions of dollars bringing its games to PS5.</a> So far, Forza Horizon 5 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-by-far-xboxs-most-successful-port-on-ps5-report/1100-6537371/" data-ref-id="1100-6537371">Microsoft's most commercially successful PS5 port.</a></p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake of the 2001 original, but without multiplayer. It's slated for release some time this year on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more.</p><p>There are other new Halo games in development, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">these titles will come to PlayStation as well.</a> This shift isn't surprising given Xbox president Sarah Bond has said the concept of exclusive games "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/" data-ref-id="1100-6535625">is antiquated for most people</a>."</p><p>In other Xbox news, the next Xbox Developer Direct is coming up on January 22, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">promising news and updates on the new Fable game and Forza Horizon 6, among others. </a></p>
