                <p>One of the most intriguing developments with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">mouse-like functionality for certain games</a>. That's been a long-requested feature, but players who love using mice appear to have that option on Switch 2 as well.</p><p>During a demonstration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-announced-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/1100-6512819/" data-ref-id="1100-6512819">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening CE</a> on Switch 2 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-supports-standard-usb-mice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>), producer Michi Ryu plugged a wired mouse into the console and began playing with it. He also noted that when the mouse is plugged in, it takes priority control away from the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also incorporate the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between Joy-Con 2's controller and mouse-like capabilities on the fly</a>. That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel. Nintendo also recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-offers-a-first-glimpse-at-how-mouse-controls-work-on-switch-2s-home-menu/1100-6531454/" data-ref-id="1100-6531454">a better look at how the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> will work.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far. Druckmann also briefly discussed the backlash from some people to the game's unveiling.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;t=3886s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Stand Media</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/just-stick-to-your-guns-neil-druckmann-isnt-phased-by-all-the-hate-intergalactic-got-theres-stuff-happening-with-media-right-now-that-you-just-have-to-ignore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Druckmann said he's "very, very excited" for Intergalactic, adding that "it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done." It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in. And I feel like that's how I want artists to carry themselves."</p><p>Gabrielle herself said she received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-star-reveals-the-advice-neil-druckmann-gave-her-about-facing-online-hate/1100-6531450/" data-ref-id="1100-6531450">"a lot of love"</a> about her playing the lead in Naughty Dog's new game, but there was also "lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of color, me having my head shaved; all these things..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>She said Druckmann told her to ignore it and have faith that Naughty Dog is "going to make something that we're proud of."</p><p>Intergalactic, which Druckmann is directing, is in the works now for PS5, but it doesn't have a release date. It's not the only game that Naughty Dog is currently building, as it's also making at least one other single-player game, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/1100-6531656/" data-ref-id="1100-6531656">Druckmann is also involved with.</a> It's unknown what this game is, but some are theorizing that it could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us 3.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, HBO's The Last of Us TV series--which Druckmann is involved with--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-finales-intense-trailer-sets-up-a-dramatic-conclusion/1100-6531633/" data-ref-id="1100-6531633">wraps up its second season on Sunday, May 25</a>.

                <p>We've probably all experienced a heated rivalry with a friend or another player in a game that transitions to a full-on grudge. Activision wants you to be able to acknowledge your Call of Duty beefs by sending your rival literal beef.</p><p>Activision has partnered with <a href="https://manlymanco.com/products/call-of-duty?variant=44725287813317" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Manly Man Co.</a>, which is an artisanal beef jerky company that makes creatively shaped products out of dried meat, to sell an edible Call of Duty-themed card to their friends. Players can purchase the "Settle our Beef" meat card for $24.50, which comes with the ability to have the sender's and receiver's name imprinted directly on the meat.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1925597637354627089" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Got a grudge?
