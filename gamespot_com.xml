              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Eight years after its 2016 launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has finally completed 100% of the game he created.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Barone--who single-handedly crafted every inch of Stardew Valley, from its art to its soundtrack to its code--has completed full start-to-finish playthroughs of his game in the past. But this week, Barone revealed that he's recently completed the game in its entirety by unlocking all of Stardew Valley's 49 Steam achievements--and that the game's 1.6 update now has a concrete release date for console and mobile devices.</p><p>"I had to do it over a couple days because I was on a multiplayer farm," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851128915047387239" rel="nofollow ">told a curious fan</a> on Twitter. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run."</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, player-characters can't just keel over and literally die in Barone's cozy little farming sim (although they can pass out). But Stardew Valley includes several arcade-style mini-games in which the <em>player-character's</em> player-character can, in fact, die. This doesn't have particularly dire consequences… unless you're shooting for the Fector's Challenge achievement. Unlocking this achievement requires players to beat one of the aforementioned arcade mini-games--Journey of the Prairie King, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/smash-tv/">Smash TV</a>-style game found in the Stardrop Saloon--without dying. Journey of the Prairie King consists of <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Journey_of_the_Prairie_King#Levels" rel="nofollow ">three stages, with a total of 10 areas to navigate</a> (plus a boss fight at the end of each stage). The minigame is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/413150/discussions/0/3288067088131225168/">notoriously difficult</a>, and is often the last achievement that Stardew Valley completionists manage to finish.</p><p dir="ltr">"I deliberately worked on Fector's Challenge because it was the only one I didn't have," <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851125512753774643" rel="nofollow ">Barone said</a>, confirming that just like many other Stardew Valley achievement hunters, Fector's Challenge was the final hurdle he had to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev also shared some tips for players who are struggling to master Journey of the Prairie King.</p><p dir="ltr">"You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851149876517912827" rel="nofollow ">explained after a player asked for advice</a>. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun power-up for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack you."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone also shared some helpful info on fighting the Outlaw:</p><p dir="ltr">"He has two moves, one where he moves across the screen and shoots," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851365802521608222" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a>. "For that one, move in the opposite direction as him to avoid his bullets, and then hit him diagonally when he pauses. The other move, he pops out and shoots straight at you. If you position yourself right at the edge of his 'cover,' he won't be able to hit you, but you can hit him."</p><p dir="ltr">But perhaps the most interesting info Barone revealed during his chat with players regarding the achievement had nothing to do with minigames at all. Instead, Barone confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update</a> is hitting consoles very soon.</p><p dir="ltr">How soon, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">"1 week," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851126588253045196" rel="nofollow ">tweeted in reply to a player</a> who had asked if there was any news about the console update.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1.6 update launched for PC last March, and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/">a massive amount of content</a>, including new items and crafting materials, improved NPC dialogue, new pets for players to adopt, a quest about a really big tree, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389"></a><figcaption>The 1.6 update breathes new life into Stardew Valley's numerous NPCs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the initial PC launch introduced a few bugs, and the update itself wasn't yet ready for release on console or mobile. Barone pledged that he would temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">cease all work on Haunted Chocolatier</a> until the Stardew Valley 1.6 update was "settled."</p><p dir="ltr">"I am eager to get back to work on [Haunted Chocolatier]," he said at the time. "But I have to see Stardew 1.6 settled, bug-free and out to all platforms first."</p><p dir="ltr">In September, he provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">an update on the state of Stardew 1.6</a>, acknowledging that the console and mobile ports were taking some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was originally hoping [the PC update and console/mobile updates] would be [releasing] maybe one month apart, max," Barone admitted. "At any rate, I feel bad about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Later that month, Barone quietly made <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow ">a post on the official Stardew Valley website</a> revealing that the update would come to console and mobile devices on November 4, which tracks with Barone's recent statement that the update is just a week away.</p><p dir="ltr">"The console and mobile ports of the 1.6 update will be released on November 4th, 2024," Barone's post reads. "Thank you for your patience. The console and mobile ports will release at version 1.6.9, which will also come to PC around that time."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone's wording makes it sound like 1.6.9 might not release for PC at the exact same time it lands on console and mobile devices. So it's unclear if he means the 1.6.9 update will come to PC a few hours after it hits console and mobile, or if PC players will have to wait a few days or weeks to gain access. Regardless, this is good news for both die-hard Stardew Valley fans and players who are itching to get their hands on Barone's next creation. </p><p>"I'm looking forward to having 1.6 fully released on all platforms," Barone said after announcing the release date. "Then I would like to finish Haunted Chocolatier next. Thank you."</p>

<p>Torvenius added, "You know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product." He added that MachineGames may release more details on the game's technical specifics ahead of launch "once we see all the telemetry on performance."</p><p>As usual, developers may not know the final details on technical performance until closer to launch, as optimization efforts continue up to release.</p><p>Torvenius shared this information against the backdrop of ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox. </a></p><p>Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a></p><p>The Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle releases on December 9, and it'll be available at launch on Game Pass, in addition to being available for direct purchase on Xbox and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">PS5 edition of the game is coming in Spring 2025.</a></p><p>In other news, it's been revealed that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">includes a disclaimer that its developer does not condone or endorse Nazi ideologies.</a></p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development. Once again set in the Exclusion Zone surrounding the Chornobyl power plant, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-to-november/1100-6525281/" data-ref-id="1100-6525281">the game will be released</a> for PC and Xbox Series X|S on November 20.</p>
