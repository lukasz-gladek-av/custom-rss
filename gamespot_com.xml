                <p dir="ltr">It was late 2020 when Universal Studios Japan first let guests inside its Super Mario World area of the park, with rides and a slew of minigames based on the Super Mario franchise. Unlike most theme-park experiences, this one was about collecting coins and stamps, competing against fellow visitors, and aiming to top the leaderboard. A pared-down version opened at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2023, cementing the idea that Universal was continuing forward with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theme-parks-are-turning-into-real-life-video-games-and-minions-land-at-universal-studios-is-the-next-step/1100-6517195/">gamification of its theme parks</a>. In May, the company's newest theme park, Universal Epic Universe, will unveil its own Super Nintendo World--complete with a Donkey Kong Country section.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot was recently given the chance to tour Epic's new Super Nintendo World and, of course, to play in it. While those who have visited Hollywood's Super Nintendo World will find parts of this new Florida location familiar, the land has been completely redesigned and is much larger. Not only does the latest iteration bring in the Donkey Kong Country ride and mini-land that opened in Japan last December, but it also brings the beloved Yoshi's Adventure dark ride. More importantly, though, it brings new challenges and ways to play in the land--and more coins to earn.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The rides</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The standout of the new land is the Donkey Kong Country rollercoaster, Minecart-Madness. Imagine blazing through one of the minecart levels from the video game franchise. That's what you're getting with Minecart-Madness, which is not a traditional rollercoaster. Instead, it's made to simulate the feeling of being in a minecart that jumps from track to track as it avoids peril at all costs.</p><p dir="ltr">If you were lucky enough to visit Universal Studios Japan since the ride's opening, you know it's a unique experience. In fact, the creatives at Universal Studios essentially had to invent a new type of ride to properly simulate the feeling of being in a minecart. That said, it adds an excellent thrill to Super Nintendo World, which was, thus far, all dark-ride attractions (style of theme park ride that sends riders through a series of animated sets aboard different types of ride vehicles).</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not a fan of rollercoasters, though, there's plenty for you to ride. Like every version of the land, Orlando features the Super Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge ride, which is meant to simulate the world of Mario Kart. You walk through Bowser's castle, see how he created his various minions and monsters, and then strap in for a race against some of the best drivers in the Mushroom Kingdom via the use of augmented-reality goggles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474774" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474774"></a><figcaption>Pikmin spotted on the Minecart-Madness roller coaster.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474774-img_4211.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The other ride in the land, which is not in the Hollywood version, is the aforementioned Yoshi's Adventure ride, which is aimed at a much younger audience. On it, you basically ride on Yoshi's back through a series of themed settings. There's not much to it, other than it's a very pleasant and relaxing ride.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The games</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The games are where Super Nintendo World shines, though. If you read our coverage of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8-things-to-know-about-super-nintendo-world-before-you-go-to-universal-studios/1100-6511778/"> Super Nintendo World</a> back when it opened at Universal Studios Hollywood, you know about collecting coins and stamps to ultimately access a boss fight against Bowser Jr. However, that's not overtly explained within the land, so it's up to the guests to explore and find ways to earn coins using the Power Up Bands. Given they cost over $40, it's a good thing Universal continues adding stuff to do with them.</p><p dir="ltr">With the addition of Yoshi's Adventure and Minecart-Madness, there's plenty more to do with them. For instance, there are several Yoshi eggs hidden in the Yoshi's Adventure ride. To obtain the golden-egg stamp, you'll have to find them all and push the appropriate button on your ride vehicle to have it tallied to your overall Super Nintendo World score.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474775-img_4204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474775" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474775-img_4204.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474775"></a><figcaption>A large G found in Donkey Kong Country.

The best minigame in this section requires you to find the giant letters that spell out Kong littered throughout the land. In the games, the Kong letters have given extra lives, unlocked special levels, or even been used as save points. In the Donkey Kong Country land, they earn a stamp and coins to help propel you to the top of the leaderboards. Additionally, there is a banana slot machine located in the area that simply takes a swipe of your Power Up Band to activate. You could earn anything from stacks of bananas to extra life balloons. What you collect determines how many coins get added to your overall score.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also hidden puzzle pieces to find, several boxes with hidden Donkey Kong logos on them to scan, a golden banana at the climax of Minecart-Madness, and a game based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-jungle-beat-was-much-more-than-a-platformer/1100-6530130/">Donkey Kong: Jungle Beat</a>. Yes, they turned the 2005 GameCube game, which came with a bongo drum peripheral, into a theme-park experience--complete with massive drums to drum along with and collect coins. Honestly, this might be the coolest game Super Nintendo World has to offer, as who actually expected a tribute to a GameCube title?</p><p dir="ltr">As you might expect, you can also earn extra coins from repeat rides of any of the attractions. If you're looking to top the leaderboard, though, keep line times in mind.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>The theming</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">This is, arguably, the most important thing at play here, especially in the Donkey Kong Country section. After all, Yoshi's Adventure easily fits into the Super Mario Land section of the park. Walking into Donkey Kong Country, as someone who first played this franchise back on the Super Nintendo, was as incredible as the first time I wandered into Super Mario Land.</p><p dir="ltr">The area is built to look like you are entering a Donkey Kong Country game, from the music and the design right down to the banana-flavored treats and the Donkey Kong meet and greet. It's hard to properly explain the feeling of being inside of a video game you grew up playing, but it's like no other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474777"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong's home in Donkey Kong Country, as well as where you can meet him.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15789737/4474777-img_4207.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That, of course, can also be viewed as a downside. After traversing all Donkey Kong Country had to offer, I wanted more. Isle of Berk, the How to Train Your Dragon section of Epic Universe, is so massive--it's the largest land in the park--and that's what I wanted for Super Nintendo World, if only to make way for even more Donkey Kong. The Mario section of the land has plenty of room and stretches out in every direction when you walk in. I want that feeling for Donkey Kong Country, which is a fraction of the size of the expansive Mario section. After all, the franchise is alive and well with a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> title, Donkey Kong Bananza, on the way. Maybe they could eventually expand to include more character meet-and-greets or even another ride. Where can I meet Cranky Kong?</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, maybe they could also extend into a new franchise under the Nintendo umbrella. Where is our Legend of Zelda land and ride?</p><p dir="ltr">Regardless, Donkey Kong Country meets the hype and, in most cases, exceeds it. It establishes Epic Universe as the home of North America's definitive Super Nintendo World (sorry, Hollywood) and creates even more ways to play and win. Plus, the banana-flavored DK Crush Sunday, served in a giant waffle cone inside of a collectible DK barrel mug--if you pay for the upcharge--is pretty delicious.</p><p dir="ltr">Orlando's Super Nintendo World, and Epic Universe as a whole, opens to the public on May 22. In addition to Super Nintendo World and Isle of Berk, the park boasts original lands and rides based on the Wizarding World of Harry Potter and the Dark Universe of Universal Monsters.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer Triband has partnered with Innersloth once again to create a new crossover for What the Car that brings the Among Us crew to the game. The free update, called Car-Mong Us, is available now on Apple Arcade and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727650/WHAT_THE_CAR/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The What the Car patch brings a new overworld to the game, which is inspired by the Skeld. For those unfamiliar, that's the iconic spaceship from Among Us. Additionally, there are new skins for the car based on the Among Us crewmembers: think red, blue, yellow, and green. The update also introduces four new minigames and three new courses to race on.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D9rWHvjehU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9D9rWHvjehU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Triband has worked together with Innersloth. A couple of years ago, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/imposters-are-coming-to-what-the-golf-with-new-among-us-crossover/1100-6513280/">an Among Us collaboration for What the Golf</a>. This might not be the end of crossovers for What the Car either, as Triband asked on Steam for feedback on "which game we should shove inside our own game next"?</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Innersloth is also busy with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/imposters-are-coming-to-what-the-golf-with-new-among-us-crossover/1100-6513280/">Among Us 3D, a new game bringing together PC and VR players</a>. One of the biggest changes is shifting the perspective to first-person as you try to determine who's the imposter among your crew (which could be you!). The original Among Us was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/check-out-the-most-downloaded-app-store-games-of-2024/2900-6092/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6092">one of the most-downloaded App Store games of 2024</a>.</p>

These include an issue causing inconsistent monster spawn density between different rooms, and further changes to monster behavior that will require new animations.</span></p><p>A few of the more frustrating bosses are also getting changes in this patch, with Viper Napuatzi and Uxmal both getting minor nerfs. The arena of the Xyclucian fight has also been cleaned up after the ground foliage was making it difficult to see the boss's attack effects. Ground foliage across the game has also been optimized with the intention of minimizing its impact on performance.</p><p>While there aren't a lot of changes to the player character in this update, there are a few small buffs and bug fixes live now. All runes have now been updated to work on Wands and Staves, each with their own set of modifiers for these weapons. Players will also have access to a blank rune that can be forged into an elemental rune of your choosing.</p><p>That's the extent of what's live with the latest update, but Path of Exile 2 developer Grinding Gear Games (GGG) isn't stopping there. In future updates the studio promises changes to make Charms more useful, and quality-of-life updates including new Stash Tab affinities and the ability to bookmark locations on your atlas.</p><p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/640181878351986722" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev notes</a> for the latest update can be found below:</p><h2>Path Of Exile 2 0.2.0E</h2><h3>Monster Speed Changes</h3><p>Many players have been reported being overwhelmed by monsters. The cause of this is a variety of factors and we are addressing them on a case by case basis. We have listed monster changes act by act below, but we also made the following changes more generally.</p><ul><li>Many human monsters including the Cultists in Freythorn, the Faridun and the Tribal Humans in Act Three have behaviour where they can interrupt their melee attacks if the player moves too far out of range during the attack, especially for attacks that have multiple hits like a swipe left into swipe right. These interrupt events have been primarily removed especially on things that were attacking very fast as it caused the monsters to be relentlessly able to pursue and attack you giving you no time to engage or use skills between their attacks.</li><li>The Haste Aura monster modifier no longer appears on monsters that are already fast.</li></ul><p><b>Act 1</b></p><ul><li>Werewolf Prowlers and Tendril Prowlers now will enter a walking stance (as opposed to running) after performing a melee action, they will only begin running again if you get a certain distance away from them. This behaviour has been applied to many faster monsters.</li><li>Hungering Stalkers now have 12% less Life and Damage, they were already relatively weak but we have lowered it a bit further to account for their high movement speed and attack speed. They are intended to engage and attack quickly, but be weak and die fast.</li><li>Reduced the number of Bloom Serpents in The Red Vale.</li><li>Halved the number of Venomous Crabs in the Hunting Grounds.</li><li>The Cultists in Freythorn no longer have interrupt events on their attacks as described above.</li><li>The Cultists in Freythorn wielding Axes and Maces in Freythorn now walk after performing a Melee Action, only running again once you exit a certain distance.</li><li>Blood Cretins on death Blood Pools have had their duration decreased from 6 seconds to 4 seconds, and fixed the area of effect to match the visual more closely.</li><li>Reduced the overall density of more challenging monsters in Ogham Manor.</li></ul><p><b>Act 2</b></p><ul><li>The Boulder Ants in Titan Valley have been replaced by Risen Maraketh, as the area had too many monsters that had irritating movement.</li><li>The Faridun have all been modified to remove the interrupt events on their attacks as described above..</li></ul><p><b>Act 3</b></p><ul><li>Diretusk Boar and Antlion Charger's are now more likely to push you to the side instead of pushing you along with them when they charge you.</li><li>The Lost City monster pack composition has been adjusted to result in less ranged monsters</li><li>Massively adjusted the Azak Bog, firstly by the aforementioned changes to interrupt events, but also changed the monster composition of the area to have less Ranged and Elite monsters.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Slitherspitter's poison spray in Venom Crypts was dealing Chaos Damage instead of Physical Damage unintentionally.</li></ul><p>We have also identified another issue that affects some areas in which potential monster spawn locations have inconsistent density in different rooms. This leads to situations where some rooms are much denser with monsters than others in an unintended way. We have a fix for this problem but it did not make it into this patch, and will be deployed in a later patch.</p><p>These are not the only changes that we will be making to monsters. Further changes will come in later updates. Some changes we didn't get time to make today, and others require new animations that will take a little longer.</p><h3>Boss Changes</h3><p>Viper Napuatzi is one of the more challenging bosses for players, so we made the following change.</p><ul><li>Lowered the amount and size of Chaos Rains (the purple ones) in the Viper Napuatzi fight, and cleaned up the visual left afterwards faster to make the following drop locations more obvious.</li></ul><p>Uxmal had various quirks that made him somewhat annoying to fight. We have made a few changes.</p><ul><li>Reduced the number of times Uxmal changes locations through the fight</li><li>Uxmal can no longer recharge Energy Shield while in the air.</li><li>Uxmal uses his Flame Breath less often</li></ul><p>Xyclucian had some issues with visibility of his effects</p><ul><li>The arena of Xyclucian has had its ground foliage removed in order to make his effects more visible</li></ul><h3>Player Minion Changes</h3><ul><li><p>We have changed the way that minion revive timers work. When your first minion dies, it sets the revive timer to 7.5 seconds as before, but each successive minion that dies increases it by less and less (still capped to a max of 7.5 seconds). This should heavily mitigate the situation where most of your minions are dead, but the revive timer keeps resetting to 7.5 seconds over and over.</p></li><li><p>Disenchanting a Bind Spectre or Tame Beast gem will unbind them, allowing you to use them again.</p></li><li>Tamed beasts can now fit through gaps of the same size that the player can.</li></ul><h3>Other Player Balance</h3><p>We don't have a lot of other player balance changes on top of the ones described yesterday, but we did manage to sneak in the following additional changes:</p><ul><li>Rally support is no longer restricted to Strikes or Slams, and can now support any Melee Attack you use yourself.</li><li>Glory (Used by Hammer of the Gods and Spear of Solaris) is now no longer consumed if you are interrupted while using the skill.</li><li>Fixed a bug where Blood Boils from the Ritualist ascendancy didn't propagate if the monster exploded on death, such as when using Herald of Blood.</li></ul><h3>Crafting Changes</h3><ul><li>We have now finished adding all of the mods to runes for caster weapons. Desert, Glacial, Storm, Iron, Body, Mind, Rebirth, Inspiration, Stone and Vision runes all now work on Wands and Staves, with their own set of modifiers.</li><li>Renly's abandoned shop in the Burning Village now also has a Blank rune which Renly can forge into any elemental rune of your choosing in case you didn't find any up to that point. As mentioned yesterday, 12 Artificers Orb's now drop at fixed locations through the campaign in addition to the random drops and salvageable ones.</li></ul><h3>Performance Improvements</h3><ul><li><p>The ground foliage in many areas has had an optimisation pass to improve performance.</p></li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a>, the Steam game about building a drug empire, has become a breakout hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/" data-ref-id="1100-6530401">since it launched</a> a little over two weeks ago, and now it's getting its first major update. The content update adds new functional stores, decor items, cosmetic items, and more. You can see the full patch notes for update 0.3.4. below.</p><p>The update adds a full interior and store functionality to Bleuballs Boutique, and does the same for the Pawn Shop, where you can sell almost anything (except drugs) to Mick. As well as the new stores, the update adds wall decor, which includes signs, lamps, collectable paintings, and more.</p><p>The new update also adds liquor, with names like Ol' Man Jimmy's Whiskey, Chateau La Peepee, and Brut du Gloop. The developer notes that liquor is purely decorative for the time being, but it will become functional in a future update.</p><p>Schedule 1 was made by TVGS (Tyler's Video Game Studio) and is primarily the work of solo developer Tyler, who is credited on the game as its artist, programmer, and designer. Other collaborators on the project include composer Kaesul and graffiti artist Cody To.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUxiQ1qN0rg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tyler says in the patch notes that they're "still ironing out the update/testing process" for the popular game, and is hoping to move to larger monthly updates from next month. While the latest update has a number of bug fixes, Tyler is hoping to mop up a few remaining bugs in the next one, including some bugs around employee behavior, corrupted save issues, and connection issues in multiplayer. The developer also adds that they'd like to get the Steam Deck officially supported for Schedule 1 as soon as possible.</p><p>Despite being mostly the work of a single developer, Schedule 1 has taken off on Steam since it released late in March. At the time of writing it is the fourth most-played game on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam charts</a>, sitting just behind behemoths like Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG.</p><p>The game has players take on the role of a small-time drug dealer arriving in a new town, as they work to build an empire. The game puts players in charge of the whole process, from manufacturing to distribution, and even hiring employees to keep the whole production running. The game also has combat elements, and a multiplayer mode allowing players to team up with a friend and run a co-op operation.</p><p>You can check out the full patch notes for Schedule 1 v0.3.4 below.</p><h3>Schedule 1 v0.3.4</h3><p><b>Additions</b></p><ul><li>Added Bleuballs Boutique interior and functionality.</li><li>Added Pawn Shop interior and functionality.

                <p>This week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/triple-i-initiative-2025-everything-announced-at-the-showcase/2900-6460/">Triple- Initiative</a> covered a wide range of genres, but for anyone looking for a retro-inspired platformer, then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/duskfade/" data-ref-id="5000-672463">Duskfade</a> was likely the star of the show for them. Currently in development at Weird Beluga Studio, Duskfade is set in a world that has become enshrouded in an eternal night. As Zirian, a young workshop apprentice, players will set out to restore time itself in this "clockpunk" world, which the studio describes as a love letter to action-platformer classics of the past.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OipFbsYpSHg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OipFbsYpSHg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Weird Beluga says that the game is designed to be a heartfelt tribute to the golden age of 3D action-platformers, while also providing players with a deeply emotional story. "Our game takes inspiration from Jak and Daxter and Ratchet and Clank, with movement that has been designed to feel agile and fast," lead programmer Tomás Manzano Sobrido explained on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/10/duskfades-nostalgic-take-on-action-platforming-is-coming-to-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Blog</a>. "Flow is a core focus, and we want players to feel like Zirian is gliding through the world, chaining actions seamlessly and covering large distances without losing momentum."</p><p>For combat, the studio says that games like games like Ratchet and Clank and Kingdom Hearts were a big source of inspiration, but it is aiming to modernize these gameplay elements. At its core, the game is a story about loss as Duskfade tells the story of siblings Zirian and Allira, who find themselves pulled into a mysterious reality shaped by memories and grief. Narrative designer Ricardo Chorques Mesa added that the game is inspired by real-life experiences from the development team and learning how to move forward.</p><p>Duskfade will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.
