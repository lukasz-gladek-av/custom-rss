The free update is out now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p><p>Two new MK-Challenges, the game's shorter-form missions, debut as Stash the Contraband and Kidnap the Mistress. Like other missions in the game, these are contextualized as brainwashing exercises, as the seedy Murkoff corporation attempts to get you to bend to their will before they release you as a sleeper agent sent into the world to cause Cold War-era chaos.</p><p>A bonus page of high-end cosmetics has been added to last season's Catalog, the game's free battle pass system, while a whole new Catalog is out now, too. It includes several skins, including one that resembles the Zodiac Killer's famous get-up. It's just the latest creepy skin in this game which seems to pride itself on its depraved cosmetics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083" data-ratio="0.56455696202532" data-width="790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083"></a><figcaption>The new Outlast Trials Catalog (battle pass) is framed around the vigilante Amelia character currently trying to topple the villains of the story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465084,1300-4465085,1300-4465086,1300-4465087" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"></figure><p>The Outlast Trials is also celebrating its first anniversary, so there are even more free cosmetics, such as a nausea-inducing cake, to be unlocked by completing the first-anniversary challenges. Both the new Catalog and these anniversary cosmetics are limited-time offerings, with them disappearing from the game in about a month on April 22.</p><p>As for game fixes, several Rigs (equippable cooldown abilities) have been buffed. The Barricade Rig can now apply to more doors and windows, locking them and slowing enemy pursuit. The Bling Rig now deploys faster at three seconds for its upgraded version or four seconds for its base version--each figure comes down one second from before the patch. The newest Rig, the Jammer, can now open mannequin gates the likes of which can be found in the nursery map.</p><p>The easiest difficulty also got a little easier, too, as enemies inflict less damage and move slightly slower. However, if all this sounds quite generous, it's not without some other punishing changes; the hardest difficulty, Psychosurgery, now features "slightly faster" enemies, as well. The full patch notes are found below:</p><h2>The Outlast Trials 2.1 update: Bug fixes and updates</h2><ul><li>Barricade Rig: Can now be deployed in more doorways and window frames.</li><li>Blind Rig: Base deploy decreased to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds), the upgraded is now 3s (was 4s).</li><li>Jammer: Jammer can now open automatic mannequin gates.</li><li>The nearest Revive Syringe location is now displayed to teammates when someone from the team dies.</li><li>Replay Introduction now displays a confirmation popup before launching.</li><li>The “Introductory” Difficulty has been adjusted for enemies to inflict less damages and move slightly slower.</li><li>The “Psychosurgery” Difficulty has been adjusted to slightly increase enemy speed.</li><li>The “Stay Together” Variator has been removed from Escalation Therapy.</li><li>Using the “Regroup” quick chat action now places a regroup icon on the ground at the player’s location.</li><li>Programs: A new visual indication is displayed for Trials completed in other difficulties than the one that is currently selected on the Trial Board.</li><li>Posters: Posters are now ordered by type (Weekly Programs, Events, etc.)</li><li>Settings: Added a new option to toggle mouse smoothing.</li></ul>

That makes it a pretty well-rounded gamepad, especially when you consider its new low price.</p><p>Aside from its universal compatibility, it's equipped with Hall Effect sticks to resist the dreaded analog drift, a six-axis gyroscope for motion controls, and dual motor vibration. It also offers two trigger modes, one of which allows for faster actuation. Its buttons are also interchangeable, allowing you to swap around its face buttons or stick caps based on your preferences. </p></div>                      </div><p>This isn't the only great controller on sale during Amazon's Big Spring Sale.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At GDC 2025, I got a chance to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunderfolk/" data-ref-id="5000-646962">Sunderfolk</a>, an upcoming cooperative turn-based tactical RPG adventure that lets you play a tabletop RPG with your friends without the need to set up any physical maps or learn a book of rules. Heck, you don't even all have to be in the same place, as the game is entirely controlled via players' cell phones. I had a lot of fun playing Sunderfolk, appreciating how its approachable structure and simple combat system made for a far easier set of mechanics to grasp in comparison to the likes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, or Vampire: The Masquerade 5e. Plenty of friend groups who have always wanted to see what all the fuss is about when it comes to tabletop RPGs but simply don't have the time or money to jump into the hobby are going to find a lot to love with Sunderfolk.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, each player picks from one of six characters: the raven Arcanist is your traditional spellcaster, the bat Bard empowers and heals allies through song, the polar bear Berserker dominates the front line with a massive hammer, the goat Ranger outputs more damage the farther they are away from the action, the weasel Rogue dismantles foes from up close, and the salamander Pyromancer unleashes fiery explosions. These six characters have been tasked with defending the Arden, a peaceful town where anthropomorphic animals live together, from a growing shadowy corruption that is transforming previously manageable annoyances into monstrous threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045"></a><figcaption>Sunderfolk's combat is played on a hexagonal grid.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I opted for the Ranger, while two members of developer Secret Door played alongside me as the Bard and Berserker. Sunderfolk can be played alone (one player would just be controlling multiple characters, akin to Baldur's Gate 3), but most of my enjoyment came from strategizing with my teammates and trying to figure out how to best pair our unique abilities together to handle a combat situation. Up to four players can play at a time in Sunderfolk, and grabbing a group of three or four feels like the ideal way to play this game.</p><p dir="ltr">While the action happened on the TV in front of us, we each controlled our respective characters with our phones. Each character has their own deck of cards with unique abilities--the Ranger, for example, had a card that when played would release a piercing shot that could hit multiple targets in a line, while the Bard had a card that let them briefly enthral a target and move them to a different space on the hexagonal board. There's no turn order to Sunderfolk, allowing players to not only choose what they do on their turn but in what order. My teammates and I would have a brief back-and-forth to discuss our options, occasionally having someone cancel their turn in the midst of planning it out so that someone else could go first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049"></a><figcaption>You can play Sunderfolk virtually, but couch co-op feels like the ideal way to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the combat section I played, our objective was to defeat a bunch of bad guys who were being mutated into powerful monsters, with little timers above their heads letting us know how many turns were left before each of their transformations. The devs told me that Sunderfolk will have combat encounters with plenty of other types of objectives, like defending a point against waves of enemies. I can't speak to what these other objective types are like, but I'm curious to play them. Some of the characters have cards that felt really out of place in a scenario that was all about defeating enemies as quickly as possible--the Ranger had an option to stop an enemy from moving and then leapfrog away, for instance--and I wonder if those cards would have felt more satisfying to play when faced with a different type of objective.</p><p dir="ltr">Between missions, all the players return to the hub-like Arden, usually leveling up and unlocking new passive perks. It is in town where each player can unlock new cards and customize their deck, talk to NPCs to befriend and/or romance them, and use loot to buy upgrades to the town that can net party-wide perks. During this downtime, the action switches from the big screen to each player's individual phone, allowing people to do whatever they want (or for someone to go to the bathroom or grab a snack while others go work on their card deck or something).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048"></a><figcaption>As you rebuild Arden, you and your friends can name parts of the town.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My favorite part of downtime is the option to name things. When our party finished funding repairs for a bridge, the player who put the most gold into the project got to name it, and then, on all of our phones, that name showed up whenever one of us visited the bridge. In addition, the NPCs would use that name when talking about the bridge. There were other fun examples of this, too, like an NPC asking the Bard to remind her what a specific thing was again, and then her using the name the dev typed in when my Ranger went to talk to her. It's a small narrative touch, but it allows you and your friends to not only build your group's version of Arden but craft stories for it too. This system of storytelling extends to other parts of the game as well. If one player romances an NPC, that will be reflected in conversations other players have with that NPC, for example, and that player will get a unique gameplay perk that relates to the romance shared between their character and that specific NPC--their connection is regularly reflected in the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-tactical-rpg-has-a-cool-tabletop-game-master-feature-please-overlook-her-railroading-faux-pas/1100-6528484/" data-ref-id="1100-6528484">The story, action, and characters are all voiced by one actor: Anjali Bhimani</a>. From what I've heard so far, she does a remarkable job, adjusting her cadence, tone, and pitch to give all the major characters their own voice and then using her natural voice to narrate what's happening (even during combat!) and help nudge players in the right direction if they need it. This replicates the feeling of playing a tabletop RPG with a Game Master while ensuring no one at the table has to actually step up and be the one responsible for dictating what happens next and bringing the story to life. I like this choice, and after loving Amelia Tyler as the Dungeon Master in Baldur's Gate 3, I hope that this is just the natural storytelling tool for these types of games going forward. Game Masters do so much and are such a crucial part of the experience for certain tabletop RPGs, that now that I know what we've been missing all this time, I do not want to go back and play certain video games--I can feel the void in TTRPG video games that forgo that all-knowing, guiding voice.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is to say that Sunderfolk was my favorite demo at GDC this year and is one of my most anticipated games for 2025. I can't wait to rope my friends into playing it with me in a few weeks when it launches for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC, and Switch on April 23.</p>
