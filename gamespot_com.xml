                <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/my-friend-pedro-review-vote-for-pedro/1900-6417173/" data-ref-id="1900-6417173">My Friend Pedro</a> has revealed its new game, Shotgun Cop Man, for PC and Nintendo Switch. In this game, Shotgun Cop Man must travel to hell and arrest Satan.</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man's main mechanic revolves around propelling the titular character using firearms across levels and platforms. Its simplistic and minimalist art style complements its chaotic gameplay, allowing players to keep track of incoming bullets while also leaving room for players to make last-minute decisions on how to evade them. Solo dev DeadToast Entertainment said that adding on extra visual flair only increased "cognitive load," leading to a decrease in gameplay flow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWSNEN2mZH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I mentioned earlier the simplicity of the shotgun-propelling being something that spoke to me. And I wanted to stick with that word, simplicity, and try to make a game where I could strip away or minimize anything that wasnâ€™t contributing to that core flowy feel and experience," DeadToast explained. "Hence the minimalist look and straightforward nature of the game."</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man also includes a level editor, which was one of My Friend Pedro's most-requested features. All of Shotgun Cop Man's levels are built with the same level-editor tools that players will have access to in the full release through Steam Workshop. There will also be No Damage and Speedrun modes for hardcore players.</p><p>The game will cost $10 when it launches on PC and Switch later this year, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">demo is now available on Steam</a>. It contains 17 levels for players to go through. It wasn't revealed whether Shotgun Cop Man would get PlayStation and Xbox releases, but My Friend Pedro eventually came <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-friend-pedro-comes-to-ps4-next-week/1100-6475317/" data-ref-id="1100-6475317">to all platforms</a>, so it's possible that Shotgun Cop Man will too.</p><p>It's also possible that Shotgun Cop Man will be playable on Switch 2, but it's currently unclear what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming system's backwards compatibility limitations are</a>.</p>
