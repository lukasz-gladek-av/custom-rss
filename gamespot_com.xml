                <p>The Simpsons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-rumored-simpsons-season-everything-we-actually-know-so-far/1100-6533563/" data-ref-id="1100-6533563">have taken over Fortnite</a> for the month of November, but players won't be sneaking around Springfield forever. A few hints for Fortnite Chapter 7 have started to emerge, and signs point to the immanent arrival of The Bride, a character played by Uma Thurman in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2.</p><p>Fortnite content creator NickEh30 posted a teaser for Chapter Seven that has a set of coordinates that lead to the Hollywood sign. The text in the teaser says, "Now Playing / Zero Hour / Chapter Seven / Fortnite After Dark With Q&amp;U." In Kill Bill, Q&amp;U was the abbreviation that Tarantino and Thurman used for their collaboration.</p><p>The new season of Fortnite should arrive near the end of November, which be only a few days before the release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair on December 5. Both halves of Tarantino's movie have been edited back into a single film of this limited theatrical event. That may explain the timing of The Bride's Fortnite debut. If other Kill Bill characters appear, we wouldn't bet against the Deadly Vipers, the Crazy 88, or even Bill himself.</p><p>Fortnite characters were also spotted at the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series victory celebration in Los Angeles. One of the signs held up said, "Game 7 first, Chapter Seven Next!!" The "Nov 29" date in the sign held by Big Dill may also be the launch point for Chapter Seven.</p><p>Fans have also noticed that Chapter Seven is breaking format slightly by listing the number as a word. That's led to speculation about the return of The Seven, an enigmatic team of helmeted characters who haven't been seen in the game for a long time. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teases-kill-bill-crossover-points-to-usa-setting" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, separate rumors about a desert biome and an Area 51-like location has some fans speculating that a Fallout collaboration may also be coming. However, that's pure speculation at this point.</p><p>For now, if you've had your eye on the the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Kang_and_Kodos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kang and Kodos</a> glider, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-fortnite-glider-how-to-unlock-the-simpsons-dlc-right-now-before-it-costs-money/1100-6535889/" data-ref-id="1100-6535889">an easy way to get it for free</a>. Fortnite dataminers are also reporting that there may soon be some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">crossovers with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>
