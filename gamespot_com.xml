                <p>From the Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption franchises to the 2K sports titles, Take-Two Interactive has some of the most-desirable games in the industry. However, the company has largely kept its marquee titles away from Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Now, Take-Two President Karl Slatoff has explained why the company hasn't embraced lending more of its games to subscription services.</p><p>"We do put our titles occasionally into some of the subscription services," Slatoff said earlier this month during a Take-Two investor call (via <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/07/take-two-ttwo-q1-2026-earnings-call-transcript/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Motley Fool</a>). "They're great partners for us. And in many cases, they're great ... We wouldn't do it unless it was a good economic deal. The platforms wouldn't do it either. So we do take advantage of that, and it's been compelling much from an economic standpoint. As it relates to NBA, we have done it in the past. We don't really talk about whether we're gonna do anything in the future. But when you do put something into a channel like that, it generates obviously, engagement. It generates income for us. And it's something that we consider, and we do it if the time is right, if the math makes sense."</p><p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has previously weighed in on the subject by stating that it doesn't make sense <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">to put any of the company's new titles on Game Pass or PS Plus</a>. He also said that high-profile day-one games like Call of Duty <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will only drive up Game Pass subscriptions for a short period of time</a>.</p><p>Raccoon Logic studio head Alex Hutchinson recently argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">launching titles day one on Game Pass can devalue games</a> and hurt the industry. Hutchinson has first-hand experience with the subject: Raccoon Logic launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/revenge-of-the-savage-planet/" data-ref-id="5000-640444">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> as a day one title earlier this year, and the company didn't get the response it hoped for.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario was released in Japan 25 years ago today, August 11, 2025. Below, we look back at how the dynamic battle system and an unusual approach to Mario lore influenced the series for years to come.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I would wager that when GameSpot posted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-preview/1100-2544763/">its first preview of the original Paper Mario</a>--then known as "Super Mario Adventure" in the US and "Super Mario RPG 2" in Japan--two and a half decades ago, no one expected it would become a beloved sub-series that people would still hold in high regard a quarter-century later.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, here we are, exactly 25 years ago to the day that Paper Mario first hit store shelves in Japan. While the majority of Paper Mario fans dote on Thousand-Year Door as the best game in the long-running series, I've always held a special fondness for the original that started it all.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario tells a story both conventional and fresh. By all accounts, it's a very by-the-books Mario tale: Bowser has procured a magical artifact of unfathomable power, captured Princess Peach, and scattered seven star-shaped MacGuffins around the world that Mario must retrieve in an epic quest to defeat him. There are no huge, defining character moments, no mind-bending plot twists. Just safe, simple Mario fare.</p><p dir="ltr">But also in typical Mario fashion, the simple concept is enhanced by its execution. What could be a bog-standard trek through a desert is enriched by a pitstop at a local outpost, where Mario must find the descendant of a band of thieves who can unlock the path to an ancient temple. Before he can climb a snowy mountain, he must first prove that he's not the culprit of a penguin murder mystery (it, uh, makes sense in context). The journey features just enough bells and whistles to help it stand out from the plumber's platforming escapades.</p><p dir="ltr">Where the game really shines is in its characterizations. Continuing the precedent set by its predecessor, Super Mario RPG, Paper Mario breathed life into the Mario universe that was still relatively unseen up to that point. For the first time, we get to see what exactly Princess Peach does while waiting for Mario to rescue her from Bowser. Far from being a helpless damsel in distress, she's bold and proactive, working to assist Mario in his quest long-distance however she can, typically by sneaking around and relaying information as to where he needs to go next. Bowser is a bigger threat than ever before, using the power of the fabled Star Rod to become virtually invincible. Yet, after stomping Mario and sending him plummeting to certain doom, what's the first thing he does? Write about it in his diary like a giddy schoolgirl. He's a terrifying threat and absolute goofball in equal measure, a memorable portrayal of the classic game villain that subsequent games and even the animated movie have built upon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6wQzSVIwYZI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's emphasis on character is well demonstrated in Toad Town, the game's hub area. With Toads in modern Mario titles, if you've seen one, you've basically seen them all. Not so here. Despite relatively similar appearances between them, dozens of Toad Town residents have unique personalities, from the couple by the fountain who always find some way to connect their love for one another to Mario's adventure to the family trying to deal with the shift in the family dynamic due to the father figure being out of a job until Princess Peach's castle is restored. The characters don't remain static, either. Their dialogue is constantly changing as Mario's journey progresses to reflect the current state of the world around them. This makes it feel like there's more to the player's journey than simply saving a princess. This time, they're saving a living, breathing world full of unique, charming characters and families--people they can actually care about.</p><p dir="ltr">But it's the portrayal of the Mushroom Kingdom's non-Toad residents where the game shines brightest. Paper Mario solidified the concept of commonplace Mario creatures having vastly different appearances, personalities, and even allegiances, an aspect of the franchise that fans have clamored to see return for decades. Super Mario RPG toyed with the concept of Bowser's minions like Goombas and Koopa Troopas defecting from his forces and living their lives on their own terms, and Paper Mario takes that concept a step further. The first characters Mario meets when beginning his journey is a family of Goombas, with no ties to Bowser whatsoever, who help nurse him back to health. Other characters, like the rich young Boo heiress Bow or the wannabe Lakitu punk Lakilester, bring fresh new designs and personalities to what were formerly very one-note Mario creatures. Best of all, they can join you as partners on your journey.</p><p dir="ltr">It's these partner characters who help make Paper Mario's RPG battle system so dynamic. Make contact with an enemy in the overworld, and a turn-based battle is initiated. While Mario avails himself of a variety of familiar jump and hammer attacks to dispatch his foes, his partners back him up with their own unique abilities. For example, Goombario specializes in headbonking enemies into unconsciousness, whereas Bombette prefers to blow her opponents up with a full-frontal assault. Enemy placement and type forces players to strategize, switching up their moves and partner characters for whatever--and whoever--is the best fit for each battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphics aside, the original Paper Mario still holds up astonishingly well. It's every bit as charming and fun to play as it was when it first released back in 2000. Its simple but engaging story and gameplay make it the perfect entry point for new RPG players and Mario fans alike. With almost every Mario RPG surrounding it having gotten a remake in recent years (including the fantastic Thousand-Year Door remake that fixed what relatively few flaws the original game had), it's certainly not an unreasonable desire for Paper Mario to receive the same treatment. Regardless of whether the game gets remade someday or remains available in its current form, any gamer who has never given the original Paper Mario a shot owes it to themselves to experience a timeless piece of Mario magic that continues to resonate 25 years later.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image credit: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wQzSVIwYZI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NintendoMovies on YouTube</a></em></p>

                <p>In 2021, Mass Effect fans were rewarded with a modern remaster of the first three games in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review/1900-6417679/" data-ref-id="1900-6417679"> Mass Effect Legendary Edition</a>. However, fans hoping for a similar remaster of the original Dragon Age trilogy may be disappointed to hear that it was already "softly" pitched to EA and rejected.</p><p>Mark Darrah--an executive producer on the first three Dragon Age games before leaving BioWare--shared that revelation during an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/1Pd9OG3HmN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-trilogy-remaster-was-pitched-to-ea-but-they-basically-seem-to-be-against-free-money-says-series-veteran" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>).</p><p>"One of the things that we pitched at one point pretty softly--so pitch is a massive overstatement--was to kind of retroactively rebrand the first three games as if they were a trilogy [and] call it the Champions trilogy," said Darrah. "EA's historically been--and I don't really know why--but they've even said this publicly. They're kind of against remasters ... It's strange for a publicly traded company to basically seem to be against free money, but they seem to be against it."</p><p>Darrah went on to explain that part of the difficulty with remastering the first three Dragon Age titles is that they were all built on different game engines. He recalled that BioWare considered hiring "a mod house that seems talented" to do a remaster. Darrah added that there were other pitches about how to bring Dragon Age: Origins "forward" that didn't go through. He also suggested that EA would only greenlight the remasters if it didn't cost the company anything extra.</p><p>"I think to some degree, EA's stance was probably, 'Sure, go ahead and do it, but do it with the money you already have,'" said Darrah. "And it's like, 'Well, we can't do it with the money that we already have because we're doing all these other things.'"</p><p>Darrah also touched upon reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">a rivalry between BioWare's Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams</a>, and shared his belief that the studio will do better with a single project at a time rather than fighting with itself for resources on multiple projects.</p><p>After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a> last year, BioWare <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff and reassigned some developers to other teams inside the company</a>.
