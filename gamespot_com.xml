The latest installment to Gearbox's hit looter-shooter franchise is all about pulse-pounding thrills and non-stop action. The campaign itself, where you take on the Timekeeper and his goons, is just your first big step before reaching the endgame.

That's because Borderlands 4 features the most seamless open-world environments in the series' history. At launch, there are four major regions: Fadefields, Terminus Range, Carcadia Burn, and Dominion. Each one is filled with countless collectibles and optional objectives.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_campaign_mission_list">Borderlands 4 campaign mission list</h2><p>Below, you can see a list of the main missions in Borderlands 4's campaign:</p><p>Intro and Fadefields arc:</p><ul><li>Guns Blazing</li><li>Recruitment Drive</li><li>Down and Outbound</li><li>A Lot to Process</li><li>One Fell Swoop</li><li>Rush the Gate</li></ul><p>Terminus Range arc:</p><ul><li>Shadow of the Mountain</li><li>Crystal Brawl</li><li>Dark Subject</li><li>His Vile Sanctum</li></ul><p>Carcadia Burn arc:</p><ul><li>Wrath of the Ripper Queen</li><li>Siege and Destroy</li><li>Unpaid Tab</li><li>Her Flaming Vision</li></ul><p>Finale and Dominion arc:</p><ul><li>Rising Action</li><li>Another Day, Another Universe</li><li>The Falling Wall</li><li>Means of Ascent</li><li>Plan Z</li><li>The Timekeeper's Order</li><li>Secrets of the Vault</li></ul><p><strong>Note:</strong> Initially, the Terminus Range and Carcadia Burn regions won't be accessible to you. However, you'll be able to venture into these areas upon completing "A Lot to Process." This is also the point where the campaign branches out so you can eliminate the Timekeeper's lieutenants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565755-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565755" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565755-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565755"></a><figcaption>An important supporting character, Zadra, tells you about the Timekeeper's lieutenants.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565755-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Extending_your_playtime__Optional_objectives_and_side_content">Extending your playtime: Optional objectives and side content</h3><p>If you're still wondering about how long it'd take to beat Borderlands 4, then just know that the main mission objectives don't hold a candle to all the activities that you can do while exploring Kairos. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>Points-of-interest - You can take control of various facilities, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-safehouse-locations-guide/2900-7016/" data-ref-id="2900-7016"><strong>Safehouses</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-order-silo-locations-guide/2900-7011/" data-ref-id="2900-7011"><strong>Order Silos</strong></a> that turn into fast travel points.</li><li>Hidden Vaults - If you manage to find fragments, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-unlock-vaults-kairos-regions/2900-7012/" data-ref-id="2900-7012"><strong>unlock Vaults in regions</strong></a>.</li><li>Collectibles - There are countless collectibles to gather, including Vault Symbols, Echo Logs, Lost Capsules, Electi Safes, and many more. If you're up for it, you could look for 200 Marcus Bobbleheads that are so well-hidden that they don't have tracking icons on the world map.</li><li>World Events - From time to time, you might stumble upon a World Event that's happening in a particular zone. It's easier to tackle these if you have buddies with you, but they still occur even if you're offline.</li><li>Side quests - Numerous NPCs have side quests that you can complete.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1152" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565756"></a><figcaption>Safehouses, Order Silos, Bunkers, Crawlers, and various points-of-interest dot the lands of Kairos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4565756-borderlands-4-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-mission-list-3.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Extending_your_playtime__Multiplayer_shenanigans__new_characters__the_looter_shooter_grind__and_Ultimate_Vault_Hunter_mode">Extending your playtime: Multiplayer shenanigans, new characters, the looter-shooter grind, and Ultimate Vault Hunter mode</h3><p>As with other games in the series, the campaign in Borderlands 4 is just a prelude to the biggest facet that would keep you preoccupied: The endgame. Once you've finished the story, you get to try all sorts of new functions, such as weekly Big Encore and Wildcard Missions. These allow you to replay activities at a higher difficulty and with additional modifiers.</p><p>Given that this is a looter-shooter game, you can expect a non-stop grind as you amass top-tier weapons and gear pieces. You might even find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-best-firmware-mods-set-bonuses-guide/2900-7017/" data-ref-id="2900-7017"><strong>Firmware mods</strong></a> that offer amazing set bonuses.</p><p>And, of course, it's more fun to play with friends, especially once you unlock Ultimate Vault Hunter mode. The higher the difficulty, the greater the challenge. Naturally, that means you'll earn better rewards, too. Oh, and compared to previous titles in the series, you can finally make new characters/classes at level 30, all while skipping the entirety of the campaign.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how long it takes to beat Borderlands 4. We hope you're ready for what lies ahead, because things are about to go bonkers as you blitz and blast your way through the world of Kairos.</p><p>From exploring vast frontiers to watching legendary loot rain down on you, there's a lot to keep you engaged as you continue your adventures as a Vault Hunter.

                <p>Valve's popular The International tournament for Dota 2 kicked off today in Germany, and company co-founder Gabe Newell addressed the crowd with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URUli8Pv1Vc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opening remarks</a> in which he said he has grown to love the game and still plays it every day despite facing some online harassment.</p><p>"Before that first International [in 2011], I really enjoyed the game, but after The International, I loved the game. It's not just the game I love, but the community. Sure, people talk shit at me in chat and about once a week, people say, 'Hey, noob, uninstall the game and [bleeped out],' but that's really about their enthusiasm for the game and the energy that they bring. And that's why after all these years, I still play Dota every day," Newell said.</p><p>The first The International took place 14 years ago in Cologne, Germany, the same city where Gamescom is held annually. This year's event is taking place in Hamburg, Germany, and matches are underway now. Teams are competing for a share of millions in prize money.</p><p>Dota 2, which is free, is consistently one of the most popular games on Steam. Today, September 11, it had <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 780,000 concurrent players at peak</a>, trailing only Valve's other huge hit, Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>In other news about Newell, the billionaire lives on a yacht and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/" data-ref-id="1100-6533251">takes breaks between work meetings to go scuba diving.</a> When he's not diving underwater, he's telling the youth that they should <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-is-a-big-believer-in-ai-calls-it-a-cheat-code/1100-6533328/" data-ref-id="1100-6533328">learn how to use AI because he believes it will be essential for success in the future.</a></p><p>Newell dropped out of Harvard in the early '80s to join Microsoft, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-millionaires-unleashed-12-ex-194415077.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaving the company as a millionaire</a> with Mike Harrington to form Valve.
