                <p>The Forge has one of the deepest crafting experiences you will find in any of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">most popular games in Roblox</a>. You are able to not only find ore throughout the world, but you are then able to take it and create gear to use for battles against zombies and more. There are so many different armor recipes you are able to craft in The Forge.</p><p>The general idea for how to craft in The Forge is pretty simple. You mine the ore using your pickaxe and then take it to the titular forge to create gear using a couple of enjoyable minigames. Depending on how many pieces of ore you use and what types they are, you will get various gear. If you want to know how to make all of the armor recipes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-forge-quest-guide-how-to-complete-all-main-quests/1100-6537007/" data-ref-id="1100-6537007">The Forge</a> Roblox, check below.</p><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Light_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Light Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286" data-ratio="0.57233626588465" data-width="2046" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629286"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629286-img_5322.jpeg"></figure><p>Light armor is the most basic type of armor you can make in The Forge. It is also the easiest, but you won’t get nearly any of the protection that the other armor types offer. That said, for beginners, light armor is what you want to start with.</p><p>In general, unless you are using a specific type of armor recipe, the ore type doesn’t matter all that much. Instead, it is all about how many pieces of ore you use. Fortunately, you don’t need many at all to make light armor.</p><p>Here are all of the light armor recipes that are available in The Forge and how to make them:</p><ul><li>Light Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting with 3 ores of any kind</li><li>Light Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 7 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Light Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting using roughly 10 pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Medium_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Medium Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287" data-ratio="0.56591796875" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629287"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629287-img_5325.jpeg"></figure><p>Medium armor is where the boosts to your stats and the money you can make from selling starts to really kick off. This is the intermediate type of armor that you should focus on once you get past the tutorial of The Forge.</p><p>Here are all of the medium armor recipes that are available currently in The Forge:</p><ul><li>Medium Helmet: 1 in 1 chance of crafting when using more than 10 pieces of ore but less than 17</li><li>Medium Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting when using more than 17 pieces of ore</li><li>Medium Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance of crafting when using 17 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Heavy_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Heavy Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288" data-ratio="0.59228515625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629288"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629288-img_5324.jpeg"></figure><p>Heavy armor, also known as knight armor, is for the players who are trying to get the most out of their ore. As you might expect, this has some of the highest stats in the game and sell price, but it has harsh requirements at the same time.</p><p>Here is how to make all of the heavy armor recipes in this Roblox experience:</p><ul><li>Knight Helmet: 1 in 1 chance when crafting with roughly 30-35 pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 35 or more pieces of ore</li><li>Knight Chestplate: 1 in 3 chance when crafting with roughly 35 or more pieces of ore</li></ul><h2 id="The_Forge_All_Special_Armor_Recipes">The Forge All Special Armor Recipes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4629307"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1316/13161402/4629307-img_5321.jpeg"></figure><p>There are special versions of the medium and heavy armor sets that you are able to make. They are generally better than their base versions, but they require highly specific sets of ore to make them.</p><p>Here is how to make the Samurai version of the medium armor set:</p><ul><li>Samurai Helmet: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 3 Eyes Ore, 3 Obsidian Ore, 3 Uranium Ore, and 7 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Leggings: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li><li>Samurai Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance of crafting with 2 Eye Ore, 5 Obsidian Ore, 5 Uranium Ore, and 5 Mythril Ore</li></ul><p>Dark Knight armor, on the other hand, is a special version of the heavy armor set. It, too, has special requirements for how to make it:</p><ul><li>Dark Knight Helmet: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with 2 Demonite Ore, 3 Eye Ore, 3 Mythril Ore, 6 Obsidian Ore, and 6 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Leggings: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 10 Demonite Ore, 2 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 9 Obsidian Ore, and 9 Uranium Ore</li><li>Dark Knight Chestplate: 1 in 2 chance when crafting with approximately 8 Demonite Ore, 5 Eye Ore, 8 Mythril Ore, 8 Obsidian Ore, and 8 Uranium Ore</li></ul><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge, so the thrills don’t end with the main quests.
