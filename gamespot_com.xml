                <p>Activision has announced that Call of Duty's big Season 3 update has brought forward its release date, while the studio has confirmed that Warzone will go offline for 24 hours prior to the return of Verdansk.</p><p>Season 3 was previously announced to kick off on April 3, but now it's starting on April 2, Activision revealed in a video podcast today (below). There will be a free 24-hour Black Ops 6 trial available at this time.</p><p>Additionally, Activision confirmed that Warzone will go offline for a period of 24 hours leading to the highly anticipated release of Warzone's OG map, Verdansk, on April 3. As a special bonus, everyone who simply opens the Warzone menu during the 24 hours that Warzone is offline will receive the Kilo weapon for free.</p><p>More specifically, Activision said players who have Warzone currently downloaded can click on the Warzone tile while the game is offline to receive the weapon. Anyone who doesn't have Warzone downloaded should do that now or soon if they want the free Kilo weapon when Verdansk launches.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKCg90ZlZJs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rKCg90ZlZJs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty seems to be banking on nostalgia to revive Warzone's player count. A recent insider report said if the arrival of Verdansk fails to retain existing players and/or bring back lapsed players, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">there will be no "Warzone 3."</a> It's not clear what this means, though.</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">InZoi is set to launch in early access tomorrow, and developer InZoi Studio is hoping its Sims-like life simulator can challenge EA's juggernaut right from the jump. After a controversy stirred regarding mods, however, one lead dev took to Steam to announce the removal of the DRM program Denuvo from the upcoming build, in a bid to quell disappointment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353752633?l=english" rel="nofollow ">statement on InZoi's official Steam page</a>, game director and producer Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim confirmed that Denuvo will not be part of InZoi's early-access launch after "consulting with teams from around the world to make a thoughtful and informed decision." Kim says that the decision to use Denuvo was initially to prevent "illegal distribution," but that including the program would ultimately not serve the community at large.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832"></a><figcaption>InZoi</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We understand that removing Denuvo increases the risk of the game being cracked and illegally distributed after release," Kim said in the statement. "At the same time, we believe it opens up a valuable opportunity: It allows InZoi to become more freely configurable--unlocking new ways for players to shape new experiences for other players. We believe enabling this freedom from the very beginning will lead to innovative and long-lasting enjoyment for the community."</p><p dir="ltr">Kim also apologized to the community for the controversy, saying they "regret the concern and confusion this has caused within the community, and weâ€™re committed to rebuilding your trust as we move forward in developing the best possible experience." He also reiterated that the team is "committed to making InZoi a highly moddable game."</p><p dir="ltr">The change in direction comes after a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2456740/discussions/0/599648005874810809/">Steam community forum post</a> mentioned that mods for InZoi would only allow for cosmetic mods--skins, clothing, etc. Specifically, the game's terms of service said that "certain content provided by the Company includes elements that you are not permitted to modify or alter at your discretion" and that players are "prohibited from making any modifications, whether in whole or in part, to such content."</p><p>InZoi launches in early access March 27 on Steam. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/">InZoi Online Showcase livestream</a> aired last week, which showed the team's initial plans for the game, including a full roadmap of what's to expect in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p>Actor Jack Black is a big fan of video games, but what games specifically does he get immersed in? In an interview, the A Minecraft Movie star sang the praises of Rockstar Games' acclaimed 2018 game Red Dead Redemption II, saying he played the title for hundreds of hours during the pandemic.</p><p>"It was over pandemic times. I played Red Dead Redemption 2, and I lived in it," he told <a href="https://comicbook.com/interviews/news/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-gaming-history-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "It was not a game. It was like a way of life. I got 400 hours clocked, and it was a lot, and I don't regret any of it. It was so fun. It's beautiful out there, it's an incredible universe they created."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1EtVPBSMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8B1EtVPBSMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is just the latest video game film for Black, as he also played Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. In video games themselves, Black is perhaps best known for portraying Eddie Riggs in Brutal Legend.</p><p>Black appeared in the interview alongside his A Minecraft Movie co-star Jason Momoa, who said he had never heard of Red Dead Redemption 2; this elicited a shocked response from Black.</p><p>"Dude, you never heard of Rockstar Games? These guys are the artists. You have to play it; it'll change your life. If you play one game, that's the one," he said.</p><p>Asked about his own favorite games, Momoa said he chooses to generally "stay away" from games due to what he said was a "pretty addictive personality." He did say he enjoyed Capcom's popular Street Fighter series, saying Ryu and Blanka are his two favorite characters.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie releases in theaters on April 4. It's been a long time coming, as the film has been in the works for more than a decade, bouncing between directors like Rob McElhenney and Shawn Levy before finally finding Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess. In addition to Black and Momoa, the film stars Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen.</p><p>It's not the only video game movie coming in April, as Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/" data-ref-id="1100-6528665">Until Dawn film arrives on April 25</a>. In the TV space, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/whos-who-in-the-last-of-us-season-2/2900-6361/" data-ref-id="2900-6361">HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 debuts on April 13.</a> As for Minecraft the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-is-a-massive-step-forward-for-the-14-year-old-game/1100-6530266/" data-ref-id="1100-6530266">a major update is coming soon that vastly improves the visuals</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-dev-has-a-fantastic-response-when-asked-about-it/1100-6530307/" data-ref-id="1100-6530307">Minecraft 2 is not happening.</a></p>
