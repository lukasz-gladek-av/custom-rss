Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford has been one of his game's most outspoken defenders, and he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">disputed players' accounts </a>about performance problems in Borderlands 4. Pitchford has also continued to be vocal on social media in the face of pushback from fans.</p><p>The majority of Pitchford's messages have included instructions and tips about how to get Borderlands 4 to perform better on PC and consoles. However, Pitchford's frustration with his fan interactions has boiled over a few times. In the post below, Pitchford suggests that a player should "get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it," before making an analogy: "I would not put a Ferrari engine in a monster truck and expect it to drive like a Ferrari." He also went on to offer optimization advice.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">You can do whatever you want.

                <p>The indie game scene may be dominated by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> at the moment, but it's not the only success story out there. Critical Reflex's new horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-im-not-a-human/" data-ref-id="5000-642535">No, I'm Not a Human</a> has already amassed an impressive audience on Twitch in only a few days after its release.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBftyLgNjyU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IBftyLgNjyU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>No, I'm Not a Human has already hit a peak of over 124,000 viewers watching it at once on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/no-im-not-a-human" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>. So far, the game's reception on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> has been more muted, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3180070/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a current peak of 8,248 players</a>. But this is a single-player game rather than a multiplayer title, which may be why it hasn't done as well on Steam yet.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human was developed by a Russian studio called Trioskaz, and it takes place in near-present apocalypse as humanity can no longer survive the intense sunlight during the day. At night, people can come out, but they aren't alone. Visitors--lethal creatures who largely appear to be human--are on the prowl and looking for their next victims.</p><p>The game takes place inside the house of the player's character, as they are approached by people who need help. Some of the people can even help the player survive. But there's always the tension about whether the guests are actually people or simply Visitors attempting to trick players before catching them off guard and murdering their human guests while they sleep. Detecting the subtle differences between humans and Visitors may mean the difference between life and death. Players learn more about distinctive Visitor traits each night through news broadcasts, but some traits are present in both humans and Visitors.</p><p>No, I'm Not a Human is currently only available on PC, however, Critical Reflex plans to port it to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

Players are currently exploring the city of San Vansterdam and discovering its secrets. One fan has already found a glitch that lets players slow their falls to a crawl as long as they're clapping on the way down.</p><p>Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1nideon/clapping_slows_your_descent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SurWesley</a> shared a video demonstrating the glitch by skating off M-Corp title. To pull off this controlled descent, players need to press the emote button while bailing and keep holding on to it. According to SurWesley, the Third Eye emote can also enable a slow fall.</p><p>It's possible that this glitch could be removed from Skate in a future update. But since it doesn't break the game, it could be potentially be kept as well.</p><p>Skate allows players to explore four different neighborhoods that have essentially been turned into giant skate parks following M-Corps' decision to abandon the city of San Vansterdamn. The game has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already surpassed 78,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, and that number may continue to rise.

And while the battle continues, so too does the struggle to address the bugs that have come up in the game. Arrowhead Game Studios has released a new patch for Helldivers 2, but there aren't many Super Earth-shattering issues this week.</p><p>The details for Helldivers 2 patch 01.400.002 have been shared on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/553850/announcements/detail/787688820859470906" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and Discord, and most of the bugs are either crash or audio-related issues. Perhaps the most amusing bug placed Helldivers on top of cave structures while reinforcing. There are two Xbox-specific fixes, including the restoration of SDR colors to their proper brightness level and a bug that prevented players from accessing Helldivers user profiles.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> unleashed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">Into the Unjust update</a>, which added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">lot of new content</a>.

The DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC provides nostalgic fans with a small but charming new island to explore and a whole new mode to work through that changes up the gameplay loop from the base game.</p><p>If you're looking to dive into Donkey Kong Bananza's DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC, here's how to get started.</p><h2>How to start the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><p>Before you can begin the DK Island + Emerald Rush DLC in Donkey Kong Bananza, you'll need to purchase it from the eShop for $20. Once you've made sure that it's installed, you can then open the game to get started. But be aware that how you access the DLC and how much of it is available to you is based on your game progress.</p><p><strong>If you've beaten the game and rolled credits</strong>, load back into your save and speak with one of the Elders (any of them will do) to learn about the rehearsals, Donkey Kong Bananza's primary endgame activity. At any point after this, you can visit any warp gong in the game to have the eel tell you about DK Island and open up fast travel there. This layer will now always be listed at the very top of the layer list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569231"></a><figcaption>The DK Island layer is always listed at the top of the layer list once it's unlocked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4569231-20250916154807-01k5a13nay7assp3eh6e01ckf5.jpg"></figure><p><strong>If you haven't beaten the game</strong>, you can speak to Squawks in the Racing Layer to open access to DK Island. However, you will only be able to explore the island at this point, as the Emerald Rush mode can only be unlocked after beating the game. </p><p>Once you arrive on DK Island, you'll find that there aren't any Banandium Gems to find. Instead, this island is designed to offer a dose of nostalgia for long-time fans and act as a hub of sorts. There are some secrets hidden around--and you can trade Banandium Chips with Squawks to earn some neat collectible statues based on various Donkey Kong characters and enemies--but the main thing to do here is speak with Void Kong and begin your journey through the Emerald Rush mode.</p><p>For more on Donkey Kong Bananza, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/donkey-kong-bananza-all-glamtone-fashion-test-solutions/2900-6782/" data-ref-id="2900-6782">All Glamstone Fashion Test Solutions</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-all-quiztone-quiz-answers/1100-6533307/" data-ref-id="1100-6533307">All Quiztone Quiz Answers</a>.</p>

                <p>After what felt like a couple of centuries in the making, EA has finally revived its classic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-2007/" data-ref-id="5000-28378">Skate</a> franchise with a new, free-to-play entry in the series. It's an early-access title right now, so it's fairly barebones in terms of its presentation, and the live-service aspect has sparked quite a bit of, ah, <em>discussion </em>among longtime fans of the series. But there is one thing that folks seem to be in agreement on with the new Skate: They nailed the feel of skating just like the original games did.</p><p>Out of the box, however, it may not feel exactly the way you remember. But there's a pretty easy solution to that problem in the game's settings, where certain "assists" are activated by default that make skating a much more forgiving experience. In addition to those must-tweak settings, we have some recommendations for other options related to custom ramps that most players will want to consider, and and audio option related to the game's narrator that could make your experience just a little less irritating in the long run. Let's take a look.</p><h2>Best settings to make new Skate make feel like the old Skate</h2><p>Navigate into the settings menu, then choose Gameplay, and then tab over to the Assists menu. For the true, old-school Skate experience, turn everything in the difficulty options section down. I did, however, allow myself to keep Allow Fall Height at 1, the middle option, for the sake of sick jumps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303" data-ratio="0.56257242178447" data-width="1726" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569303"></a><figcaption>For the truly unforgiving old Skate experience, turn all these options all the way to the left.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569303-skatedifficultassists.png"></figure><p>But wait, there's more! Below that you'll also find On-Board Helpers, and it's the same story here as it is above: turn them off. But if you'd like to ease yourself into it, you can leave on Prevent Low Air Spins, which makes it a little easier to maintain control at high speeds by preventing you from turning yourself when you're bouncing slightly. But eventually you'll want to turn that one off too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305" data-ratio="0.56278366111952" data-width="1983" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569305"></a><figcaption>These On-Board Helpers can make your skating time easier if that's what you're into.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569305-onboardhelpers.png"></figure><p>There's also an Off-Board Helpers section at the bottom of this menu, but you can do whatever with those since those settings make it easier to get around on foot. You can do far more on foot in this game, like climbing up the sides of buildings, than you could in the old ones, so we endorse anything that makes that go faster so we can get back to skating.</p><p>Congrats, you've turned the new Skate into the same sort of painful and unforgiving experience that the old games were. But there are a couple other very important settings you'll also want to know about before too long.</p><h2>Turn off other people's quick-drop ramps</h2><p>The new Skate brings back and improves upon one of Skate 3's best features: the ability to place ramps and other objects anywhere you want in the world with a couple of button presses. The downside of this, however, is that this new Skate is an always-online game in which the world is constantly filled with other players, and they can also place ramps wherever they want, too. Knowing our fellow gamers the way we do, it's not hard to imagine a number of different scenarios in which folks might be really irritating with their ramp powers.</p><p>Fortunately, this problem can be wrangled quickly in a way that you probably didn't even know existed since you can't access it from the normal settings menu. To find it, you'll need to pull up the quick drop menu by pressing right on the d-pad, and then press the Options/Start button to open the quick drop settings menu. Scroll to the Multiplayer section at the bottom. Here you can govern whether you'll be subject to ramps placed by other players--and, crucially, you can make it so other players can't mess with the ramps that you place.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306" data-ratio="0.56281725888325" data-width="1576" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png" data-ref-id="1300-4569306"></a><figcaption>Free yourself from the tyranny of random people's ramps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4569306-quickdropedits.png"></figure><p>Once you're done with that, there's still one more setting you may want to keep in mind, particularly in the early goings.</p><h2>How to turn off the narrator</h2><p>Throughout your time in Skate, a nice digital lady called Vee runs you through the tutorials and missions as you learn the game and progress through, similar to the cameraman role that Giovanni Reda played in the original three games. Unfortunately, Vee is not as much fun to listen to as Reda was, and she really talks way, way more than she should, often repeating the same message over and over every time you return to your session marker, which is maddening. Fortunately, you can disable her idle chatter completely by turning off Gameplay Vee Comments in the <strong>Audio settings</strong> menu.</p>

                <p>Next month, Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher is coming out of retirement in a new Netflix animated series, Splinter Cell: Deathwatch. While the show will feature a new story that's not adapted from the games, the latest trailer for Deathwatch reveals that one of the primary adversaries is someone with a link to Sam's past.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A9iFjaKeMk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4A9iFjaKeMk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-puts-sam-fisher-back-in-action/1100-6534204/" data-ref-id="1100-6534204">previous trailer for Deathwatch</a> had a quick glimpse of a gravestone for Douglas Shetland, who was a character in the Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory games. Douglas was also one of Sam's closest friends, but when he turned against his country, Sam felt there was no other choice but to kill him.</p><p>This trailer briefly revisits the final moments of Doug's life before jumping back to his grave. Sam's decision appears to be coming back to haunt him, now that Douglas' daughter, Diana Shetland, has emerged as the CEO of Xanadu, the corporation that's pulling the strings of a new crisis.</p><p>Liev Schreiber is stepping into the role of Sam for the series. Michael Ironside has voiced Sam in most of the Splinter Cell video games to date, but the role was also played by Eric Johnson in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, the most recent game in the series. The Sandman's Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing a new agent, Zinnia McKenna, alongside Janet Varney as Anna "Grim" Grímsdóttir, and Joel Oulette as Thunder.</p><p>John Wick co-creator Derek Kolstad is the head writer and producer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, and the animation was provided by Sun Creature Studio and Fost. Netflix will debut the series on October 14.</p><p>On the video game front, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splinter-cell-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-548587">a Splinter Cell remake</a> in development, but there hasn't been many updates about that game since it was announced in 2022. Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shows-it-hasnt-totally-forgotten-about-splinter-cell/1100-6531177/" data-ref-id="1100-6531177">added Steam achievements to Splinter Cell: Blacklist</a>, which was released in 2013.</p>
