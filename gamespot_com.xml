<section><p>It exemplifies the unsexy and tedious work of building bridges and community in its quest design, upgrade systems, and writing.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Throughout the events of Promise Mascot Agency, I was Pinky's ride. Anywhere that she needed to go, I had to ferry her in my crappy little truck. As a matter of fact, I was responsible for the transport of any and every mascot that stumbled through the doors of the Promise Mascot Agency and came under my employ. When Kofun needed to go to a nearby graveyard, I was the guy for the job. When Trororo needed a lift to the local adult store, I begrudgingly told him to hop in. Be it by land, air, or sea, it became my responsibility, and mine alone, to make sure everyone got where they needed to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency is a game filled to the brim with chores and mundane tasks like this. As I traveled across the isle of Kaso-Machi, drifting in and out of decrepit villages and farm fields, I found that Promise Mascot Agency's cast was filled with folks in need of some assistance. The English teacher who worked unpaid overtime shifts to put on a night school at her underfunded workplace. The nearby mechanic with an insatiable curiosity for the occult, and no time between his job and family. If a shrine needed to be swept, I was there with a broom in a split second. Whether it was the local barkeep in a gimp suit, the streamer-turned-farmer, or of course, the disenfranchised youth, I was there with an olive branch to extend.</p><p dir="ltr">Promise Mascot Agency probably sounds like a convoluted game. It is. In one breath, it is a title about an ex-yakuza--handsomely voiced by the same actor behind Kiryu in the Yakuza games--driving around a countryside, rounding up seemingly endless collectibles and upgrades, and sending living mascots (like a giant crying tofu block) out on jobs via a simplistic management system and card-based minigame. In the latter, you must play support cards with differing strengths and weaknesses as a mascot performs a job in order to beat a troubling interference that arises and assure the job is a success. In another breath, it is a full-throated exercise in the lengths of compassion and empathy. It is rarely sleek and sexy about it--Promise Mascot Agency doesn't feature over-the-top set pieces or hide slick new super moves to reward the player for completing its long list of chores. But real, tender empathy for your fellow man rarely does look so good, and Promise Mascot Agency's unglamorous honesty is something I've come to admire from one of 2025's best and brightest games.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first arrive in Kaso-Machi and take on stewardship of the mascot agency, your primary goal is to drive better foot traffic to the formerly popular tourist destinations around town. Due to the dwindling economic status of the island, most of the people who have survived its trials and tribulations have moved on from it. All that's left behind are pockets of increasingly poorer people who are either too proud to leave or simply stuck. The economy needs a shot in the arm, and so it falls on you as Michi--who has been cast out from the yakuza for a job gone wrong--to send in mascots to the few businesses still operating, drum up interest, and invest your earnings into other ventures and mascots around Kaso-Machi.</p><p dir="ltr">Progress is slow but steady. Before you know it, districts that once seemed destined to fade into nothingness begin displaying faint signs of life again. A long-dormant festival is resurrected and, with time, this energy ripples outward to the rest of the island. The largely abandoned train station in the heart of town, which is presided over by a charming man and his cat-with-a-hat, is brought back from the brink of redundancy. A few towns over from Kaso-Machi's central hub, you revive an arcade. As the cultural centers and infrastructure of Kaso-Machi are resurrected, life in the reportedly cursed isle begins to flourish once more, and its residents invest that good will and energy back into you, the catalyst for this change.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4623273"></a><figcaption>Pinky isn't the only weirdo you help out across Kaso-Machi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4623273-promisemascotagencytruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Sure, what I'm describing is a fairly standard upgrade system, but something about the way Promise Mascot Agency conveys them makes it stand above its peers. The "power-ups" gifted to Michi and Pinky aren't really the kind of skills that the player can then turn around and use for their own benefit like a standard skill tree or progression system. For example, you get a turbo upgrade for your truck, but it doesn't benefit you alone to use it. There are no races in Promise Mascot Agency, though a post-launch update did add time trials. It is, however, useful in getting you, and whomever you're carrying, to your destination more quickly and continuing to help and delegate tasks around the island. The same goes for the eventual boat and flying upgrades you gain as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Promise Mascot Agency follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The cannon upgrade you receive partway through Promise Mascot Agency almost appears like the moment the game might introduce some kind of vehicular combat. Instead, you use it to launch Pinky, Promise Mascot Agency's sociopathic companion character, at piles of trash, since one of the side-activities you're invited to take part in is to clear Kaso-machi's abundance of garbage You can additionally fire her at reelection signs for the corrupt mayor, whom Pinky winds up running against in the game's final act! Otherwise, the cannon is almost comically useless: It will just launch Pinky straight up into the sky to the benefit of no one at all.</p><p dir="ltr">It is kind of funny how mundane Promise Mascot Agency turns out to be. It's a lot like the Yakuza games in that sense, which feature no shortage of oddball characters on sometimes incomprehensible journeys that often resolve themselves in deeply humane, relatable, and sometimes abjectly dull ways. It is a perspective on the human condition I resonate with on a profound level, and it is one I was so happy to find beneath the surface of Promise Mascot Agency. It's why I reveled in the simplistic motivations of its cast, and why I found myself entranced by the busywork they constantly dropped on me, as well as the mission of bettering the lives of everyone in Kaso-Machi. Of building a community that could withstand the corruption of local governance, overcome its grisly and tragic past, and forge a brighter future together.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the community-building the player spends the game toiling away at--all the garbage you clean, signs you take down, and businesses you bring back to Kaso-Machi--comes to a head in the game’s rousing finale. To make a complicated matter short, the continued existence of your agency, which has provided a home to mascots, economic stability to the island, and exposed local corruption, is being threatened. The only way to assure it continues is to win a national competition that is, as becomes obvious, rigged against you.</p><p dir="ltr">You lose, and you lose quite badly. But at Michi's lowest point, he retreats to a mind palace of sorts (Pinky dubs it a "metaphysical nightmare") and comes face to face with everyone he's helped--that you, the player, have helped. Every mascot we employed, every business owner we aided, every teenage thug we straightened out, and even members of the yakuza family that had tossed us out appeared to Michi. An island's worth of friendly faces propped us up, dusted us off, and reminded us that we weren't alone.</p><p>The end of the game plays out like a gauntlet of Promise Mascot Agency's card-based minigame. Only, by the game's end, all of your allies' support cards have been consolidated into a handful of overpowered ones that wipe out any threat with a single play. And as I cruised to Promise Mascot Agency's end on the back of the community that I'd spent 20+ hours building and fortifying, I couldn't help but think that of course the strongest power of them all was the power of friendship. Who would've thought that I'd find one of the richest examples of community in one of the most bizarre games about driving a human-sized, sentient (and not to mention, homicidal) thumb around town?</p>

<section><p>In Silent Hill F, systemic violence gets bloody, embodied life.</p></section>

                <p dir="ltr">What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening.</p><p dir="ltr">All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Silent Hill F Is Connected To The Rest Of The Series</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, Silent Hill f takes place both in a "real world," covered in fog and invaded by twisted human forms, and in an "other world," which distorts the real. Unlike its predecessors, the gap between the real world and the other world is clearly delineated. Whenever Hinako falls unconscious, she wakes up in the other world. At first, it would seem that her experiences in her hometown are "real" and her time in the other world, marked with Shinto monuments and dream mansions suspended over water, is fake. However, the game's first ending calls this binary into question. The sequence’s final moments reveal Hinako to be much older now than her appearance would suggest. The girl we've been playing the whole time is almost a psychic scream, a representation of the younger Hinako whose dreams were betrayed by the older.</p><p dir="ltr">What was that betrayal? Nothing but the rite promised to all women: marriage. Her parents have promised Hinako to a suitor to settle a family debt. The real world represents how the arrangement slowly strips away her connections to her friends, her family, and herself . The other world stands in for the process of her courtship. The process of playing Silent Hill f, at least in an initial playthrough, is the process of tearing Hinako apart along those axes. She is both victim and thief. One version of her weds the thing that drains the other's world of life.</p><p dir="ltr">In the other world, a mysterious man only called Fox Mask courts Hinako. After a few preliminary trials, including ritualistic killings of her close friends, Hinako descends a staircase to yet another set of ritual grounds. At each site, a new torture awaits. First, Hinako saws off her own arm, then cultists brand her back, and finally, they slice a portion of her face off and replace it with a fox mask of her own. It is easy enough, though gruesome, to write it out. But the visual presentation is grueling.</p><p dir="ltr">Before each ritual, the fox cult display the tools of their torture. Then, they go about their work. The camera work is unsparring, but off center. We see a medium close-up of Hinako's face as she pulls the saw across her shoulder, or blood spilling between her feet as one cultist carves a knife into her face. There is a sense of witnessing, wanting to avert your eyes, but not being able to look away. Like all of Silent Hill f's cutscenes, there are no interactive elements. Here, that fact underlines how Hinako is treated as an object, which Fox Mask and the cultists chisel to their own liking.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of words of comfort and strength from Fox Mask, the cultists are totally silent as they conduct the rituals. They communicate their intent only through gesture and presentation. The effect is almost like a pantomime. These rituals are familiar to everyone present except Hinako. The camera frames her alone, in ordinary schoolgirl clothes, totally surrounded. She is ignorant; the cultists are her teachers. They cut their lessons on her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hinako's violent transformation rings out across the rest of the game. For one, it acts as the most profound distinction between the two Hinakos. While the student Hinako wields baseball bats, pipes, and if she is lucky, a kitchen knife in the real world, the other Hinako gains a magnificent, monstrous fox arm, a spiritual weapon that will never decay or break. The brand lets her open new doors, while the mask sees hidden paths. The more Hinako becomes a bride, the more power she gains.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that power makes her more vulnerable. With each power, Hinako's "sanity" meter drains. Whether it is an accurate localization or not, I feel "sanity" does not accurately communicate how the mechanic works. One could also describe it as "will" or "resistance." Hinako's fox powers drain sanity and the regular food objects of the town restore it. It represents Hinako's willingness to give in to becoming a bride. The more Hinako embraces the fox, the more sanity she'll expend. The difference in how those mechanics impact the two different Hinakos makes an argument. Every time you use the arm, or regret its absence, you cannot help but think of Hinako's pain in acquiring it, of the tears of blood rolling down her cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">The ritual's horrifying power is something of a double-edged sword. In subsequent endings, the game turns redemptive. Fox Mask, actually a boy named Tsuneki Kotoyuki, is kind-hearted and well-meaning. Hinako reconciles her two selves. There aren't exactly any thematic problems with this. Fox Mask's good intentions are even a profound provocation. The system dehumanizes, however kind-hearted or well-meaning its agents are. Yet, Silent Hill f's ultimate run of boss fights and reconciliations can't help but feel hollow in the face of the game's prior violences.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, it's hard to hold its deflating final ending, unlocked after a minimum of three complete runs, too much against Silent Hill f. Few games can claim to have any moments of such startling, unsettling power. Fewer still elaborate on those moments with intelligence and complexity. Silent Hill f does both and much more besides. It matters how much a game makes you feel. Each time Hinako bowed her head to harm, I felt such terror, revulsion, and aching, aching sadness. The feeling will stay with me long after the details of Silent Hill f are gone from my memory.</p>
