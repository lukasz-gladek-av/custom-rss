                <p dir="ltr">The longtime franchise mode in the Madden NFL series lets players make decisions for their favorite team, such as drafting players and signing free agents. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making. In fact, Johnson reportedly axed a trade this past offseason involving a wide receiver because the player's rating in Madden NFL 24 was too low.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Jets were close to agreeing to a trade with the Denver Broncos in March for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. But then, Johnson reportedly killed negotiations after looking at Jeudy's Madden NFL 24 rating. Electronic Arts tweaks player ratings throughout the season, but <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/24/madden-nfl-24-denver-broncos-ratings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Denver Post</a> notes that Jeudy was an overall 83 before the start of last season. Interestingly enough, the wide receiver--who ultimately was traded to the Cleveland Browns--still sports the same <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/ratings/player-ratings/jerry-jeudy/20940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">83 overall rating in Madden NFL 25</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="306442581" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September. It won the award for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024</a>. This year's show also introduced the "Game Changer" award for Amir Satvat, who has helped laid-off game developers find openings at other companies over the last year.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2 review</a>, we said, "Frostpunk 2's challenging gameplay makes for a compelling experience despite a dour and cynical view of human nature."</p>

                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.

                <p>Sony Group has agreed to buy more than 12 million more shares in Elden Ring parent company Kadokawa Corporation, with Sony becoming Kadokawas's largest shareholder. Sony will own 10% of Kadokawa's shares after buying 12,054,100 new shares for about 50 billion yen ($319 million USD).</p><p>Sony Group <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it plans to buy the shares on January 7, 2025. It follows on from Sony's previous acquisition of Kadokawa shares in February 2021.</p><p>Sony and Kadokawa have worked together on a number of projects throughout the years, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors swirled recently </a>that Sony might have been plotting to buy the company outright. That isn't happening, though, at least not at this stage.</p><p>As part of the deal, Sony said it will work together to adapt some of Kadokawa's franchises for global and TV dramas and live-action films, though no specifics projects were announced. Sony will also co-produce Kadokawa anime projects and "further expand" its publishing efforts for Kadokawa's games.</p><p>From Software's Elden Ring is one of Kadokawa's biggest gaming projects, and the series continues in 2025 with the debut of the standalone game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">Elden Ring Nightrein.</a> Beyond gaming, Kadokawa is known for media franchises like Re: Zero and Delicious in Dungeon, among numerous others.</p><p>Sony is also heavily invested in Fortnite studio Epic Games. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">Sony invested more than $1 billion into Epic Games to help create the metaverse</a>, which followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-200-million-more-into-fortnite-developer-epic-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6490077/" data-ref-id="1100-6490077">$200 million investment in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-250-million-into-fortnite-dev-epic-ga/1100-6479536/" data-ref-id="1100-6479536">$250 million in 2020.</a> All up, Sony has invested more than $1.45 billion into Epic Games, which is about 4.5X more than it just agreed to invest into Kadokawa.</p>
