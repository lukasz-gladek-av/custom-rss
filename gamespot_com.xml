                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> officially falls on November 29, plenty of retailers have jumped the gun and are already offering incredible price cuts. That’s especially true of <a href="https://howl.link/pctsffgq35i7b?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17322905694352?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Logitech+gaming+mouse&amp;i=black-friday&amp;crid=1P6XJDLHZFEI1&amp;sprefix=logitech+gaming+mouse,black-friday,112&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>--both of which are <strong>slashing prices on a long list of popular Logitech gaming mice</strong>. These run the gamut from affordable models to ultra-premium models, so whether you need something for competitive online gaming or simply chopping trees in RuneScape, now is a great time to upgrade your PC gaming setup.</p><p>One of our favorite deals is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07CMS5Q6P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Logitech G305 Lightspeed Wireless Gaming Mouse</a>, as it’s now just $28.50 (was $50). That’s just a few bucks shy of its lowest price ever, and its lightweight design and six programmable buttons make it a good companion for most games. With a staggering 250 hours of gameplay on a single AA battery, a total weight of 99 grams, and a Hero Gaming Sensor that supports 400 IPS and up to 12,000 DPI, it’s a pretty great deal. Be sure to clip the coupon on its store page before checkout to see the full discount.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404028-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-08-46-am-1539.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404028" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404028-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-08-46-am-1539.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404028"></a><figcaption>Logitech G305 Wireless Gaming Mouse and Logitech G502 X Wireless Gaming Mouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404028-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-08-46-am-1539.jpg"></figure><p>Need something more extreme?

It's bad news right away, though, as she finds her friend, Safi, lying dead in the snow after being murdered.</p><p>Using her powers, Max creates a parallel timeline in which Safi is still alive, but unfortunately for her, the killer wants her dead in that timeline as well. The hook in Double Exposure is that Max can shift between timelines in an attempt to stop the murders in both timelines.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-an-underdeveloped-picture/1900-6418321/" data-ref-id="1900-6418321">Double Exposure review</a> scored the game a 6/10.

                <p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl launched on November 20 after years of development, and it seems to be off to a solid start. Developer GSC Game World announced that the first-person survival game has cleared 1 million copies sold across PC and Xbox, but that doesn't tell the entire story of how many people have played it.</p><p>In its statement, GSC said that in addition to the 1 million sales, "much more stalkers" have joined in thanks to Game Pass. The studio did not specify how many people are playing on Game Pass, however.</p><p>There is an ongoing discussion about whether or not releasing on Game Pass at launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">negatively impacts sales</a>.

It's had a long and bumpy road to release, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-eyeing-2012/1100-6273454/" data-ref-id="1100-6273454">Stalker 2 was originally announced to release all the way back in 2012</a>. The game was in fact <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-canceled/1100-6373393/" data-ref-id="1100-6373393">canceled in 2012</a>, but later reemerged and was eventually made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5.</p><p>Stalker 2 was later reassigned a 2022 release date, but the game's development was halted following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where the studio has offices. It later shifted to September 2024 before getting delayed once more to November 20, a date that stuck.</p><p>In addition to being available for outright purchase, Stalker 2 is available as part of Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.
