                <p dir="ltr">In September 2021, a massive leak at Nvidia revealed multiple then-unannounced projects, and as years have passed since the leak, all but one of the leaked titles associated with Square Enix has been officially confirmed. That one is a remake of Final Fantasy IX, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary today--and Square Enix has commemorated the milestone by fueling those remake rumors with a new anniversary video.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/remake-reports-persist-as-square-enix-releases-final-fantasy-9-anniversary-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the minute-long video--set to the iconic song Melodies of Life from the FFIX soundtrack--runs through key moments from the ninth Final Fantasy adventure, with shots of main characters Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and more peppered throughout. The video ends with new artwork of the team, with the words "Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary" included.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFDDlEaUXxw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video has intensified the rumors of a remake which began with the Nvidia leak, with many wondering if the project is still in development. Prominent leaker NateTheHate, in a <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1942164160365703368" rel="nofollow ">comment on a ResetEra thread about the video</a>, mentioned that, perhaps, the remake may no longer be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," NateTheHate's <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968" rel="nofollow ">comment reads</a>, "but I need to do a fresh check and see what a more current status is--as I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble and possibly canceled. I only had one source on the cancellation possibility and need to verify the info further."</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has not commented on the rumored project since it was first mentioned in the Nvidia leak. However, of the eight Square Enix games featured in the leak, seven of them have since been announced or released--with the most recent confirmation being<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/"> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> during the PlayStation State Of Play presentation last month.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of eight Square Enix games that came from the Nvidia leak were as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 9 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Kingdom Hearts IV</li><li dir="ltr">"New strategy game" (since revealed as The Diofield Chronicle)</li><li dir="ltr">Tactics Ogre: Reborn</li><li dir="ltr">"Unannounced Card Game 2" (since revealed as Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden)</li></ul>
