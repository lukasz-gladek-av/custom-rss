                <p>Are you curious about New Game Plus in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251"><strong>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</strong></a>? This mode is a staple in soulslike and role-playing games, letting you restart your adventure with the goodies that you've found during your first playthrough. That said, there are some caveats that might surprise you with how Wuchang handles this concept. Oh, and before we continue, please be reminded that this article contains <strong>minor spoilers</strong>.</p><h2>What to expect in New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</h2><p>New Game Plus mode is unlocked after completing the campaign and obtaining an ending. After the end credits roll, you'll be sent back to the main menu. Unfortunately, we're not allowed to show an image just yet, but you should see an option called "Causality Reversal," which is the term that the game uses for New Game Plus mode.</p><h3>Should you start New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>Here's the surprising part: You're actually <em>forced</em> to start Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode after beating the game.</p><p>It doesn't matter if you pick "Causality Reversal," "Continue," or "Load Game." All these options bring you back to the game's intro for a New Game Plus run. <strong>Worse, your original save file will be overwritten, too</strong>.</p><p>This can be a bit problematic, especially if you missed a few items or spells during your initial playthrough. It's also different from how other games handled this feature--i.e. there's an option to try New Game Plus via the main menu, but you can still load your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538239"></a><figcaption>Wuchang wakes up in the same cave upon starting New Game Plus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538239-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Is there a way to avoid New Game Plus mode?</h3><p>If you're not ready yet for New Game Plus in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, you need to have a backup save before you conclude the campaign. This is how we did our workaround for the PC (Steam) version of the game:</p><ul><li>Prior to obtaining an ending, we exited the game so we could have a backup of the save state.</li><li>The files/folders that you need are in the "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\Project_Plague" directory.</li><li>Copy the whole "Saved" folder and place it somewhere else.</li></ul><p>If you need to revert to a previous state, simply place the "Saved" folder in the "Project_Plague" directory and overwrite everything there. Then, launch Wuchang and pick "Load Game" from the main menu.</p><p>The save file might say "Causality Reversal 1"--i.e. New Game +1--but that's fine. This is mostly due to cloud functionality. Upon loading it, you should find yourself at the same spot as your original save.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538240"></a><figcaption>Items that can't be duplicated grant you Red Mercury blood resources instead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4538240-wuchang-fallen-feathers-new-game-plus-2.jpg"></figure><h3>What carries over and what changes in New Game Plus?</h3><p>Here's what you can expect in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' New Game Plus mode:</p><ul><li>You carry over all your equipment/gear pieces, Red Mercury, unlocked skills, spells, temperance needles, and the like.</li><li>Enemies will be tougher this time around.</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-jade-pendants-guide/2900-6798/" data-ref-id="2900-6798"><strong>Jade Pendants</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-best-benedictions-guide/2900-6799/" data-ref-id="2900-6799"><strong>Benedictions</strong></a> that you pick up have a +1 coefficient, which means their effects are more potent.</li><li>Vendors still sell the same items. You can't purchase stuff that can't have duplicates--i.e. spells.</li><li>If you loot items that can't have duplicates--i.e. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-manna-vase-upgrades-forgotten-remembrance-lost-remains-guide/2900-6791/" data-ref-id="2900-6791"><strong>Manna Vase upgrades</strong></a> and spells--you'll receive Red Mercury-related materials instead.</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bamboo-shoots-panda-guide/2900-6794/" data-ref-id="2900-6794"><strong>Panda Bamboozlings/Bamboo Shoots</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-inner-demon-manifestations-spawn-locations-guide/2900-6795/" data-ref-id="2900-6795"><strong>Inner Demons</strong></a> that you killed before will respawn in the same locations.

                <p>With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s summer season finally drawing to a close, we've got some big stuff to look forward to in Chapter 6 Season 4, especially with Fortnitemares just around the corner. Epic Games hasn't yet begun teasing the new season, so we don't officially know much of anything yet. But as is usually the case, enough details have leaked that we're able to get at least a little bit of a sense about what's coming.</p><p dir="ltr">With that being the case, let's stop messing around and get right to the details.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_start_">When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 start?</a></li><li><a href="#Is_there_a_live_event_to_end_Chapter_6_Season_3_">Is there a live event to end Chapter 6 Season 3?</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Season_4_the_final_Season_of_Fortnite_Chapter_6_">Is Season 4 the final Season of Fortnite Chapter 6?</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_battle_pass">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_gameplay_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 gameplay changes</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnitemares_2025">Fortnitemares 2025</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_map_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 map changes</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_start_">When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 start?</h2><p dir="ltr">The current season is set to end on August 7, which is a Thursday. Chapter 6 Season 4 should therefore kick off the next morning, on August 8.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_there_a_live_event_to_end_Chapter_6_Season_3_">Is there a live event to end Chapter 6 Season 3?</h2><p dir="ltr">With the season coming to a close on a Thursday night, there <em>probably</em> won't be a major live event in Battle Royale to close the season. But a smaller ambient live event, like the giant sword battle between Daigo and Kendo that happened during BR matches at the end of Chapter 6 Season 1, is still possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, however, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-ogs-rocket-live-event-is-just-days-away/1100-6533279/" data-ref-id="1100-6533279">event ending the current Fortnite OG season</a>, if you're into that nostalgic mode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538420" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538420"></a><figcaption>Chapter 6 Season 3 is just about over.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4538420-fortnitegecko.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_Season_4_the_final_Season_of_Fortnite_Chapter_6_">Is Season 4 the final Season of Fortnite Chapter 6?</h2><p dir="ltr">Since new Fortnite chapters have always launched in December, for Season 4 to be the last season of the chapter, it would have to run for nearly four months. Considering Season 3 is going to be Fortnite's shortest season ever at just over two months, it would be pretty surprising if Season 4 were twice as long.</p><p dir="ltr">No, with Season 4 starting so relatively early, we should expect a new mini-season, like last year's Chapter 2 Remix, and this spring's Star Wars Galactic Battle. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1931472840118993316" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It's been rumored for months</a> that The Simpsons will be the subject of the next mini-season, so that's what everyone is currently expecting in November.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_season_theme">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 season theme</h2><p dir="ltr">It's also been rumored for months that Season 4 will have <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1931514174334443794" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an alien invasion theme</a>, apparently involving bug people rather than Fortnite's traditional-style aliens like Human Bill or Kymera. It wouldn't be the first time an alien invasion has hit the Battle Royale island. During Chapter 2 Season 7, aliens led by the nefarious Last Reality tried to take over the island and would abduct players during matches and force them to play mini-games for loot.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if this rumored new invasion would have anything to do with the previous one, or if it might <em>Herald</em> (<a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8338" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cough cough</a>) the return of some old favorite characters like Dr. Slone, the Cube Queen, or the IO.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538431"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite island previously suffered an alien invasion back in Chapter 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4538431-fortniteinvasion.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_battle_pass">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been any specific leaks about what will be on the Chapter 6 Season 4 battle pass yet, but there were a number of bug-themed skins on a recent survey that Epic sent to some Fortnite players. <a href="https://youtu.be/p46Bubo-rx4?si=qA4CZ1IM2s3p7a5A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This video</a> from content creator Nerpah highlights some of them--just keep in mind that the video contains no leaks or confirmed info about battle pass skins, and is purely speculative based on leaks about the theme.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_gameplay_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 gameplay changes</h2><p dir="ltr">There haven't been many detailed leaks aside from the season theme itself, but a couple of notable things have come through, like a new "<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bug gauntlets</a>" item, and the return of mud. We don't know what the bug gauntlets are, but it would likely be a weapon or utility item like this season's Bass Boost (movement and a knockback attack) and Myst Gauntlets (fires a flock of birds).</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1948212946145833017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mud</a>, we last saw that mechanic back in Chapter 4 when Epic added a jungle biome to the center of the island. Players could use the mud puddles for quick movement, and in the process would cover themselves in mud that would make them invisible to thermal scopes. So if mud returns, it may bring some other things with it, like more items with thermal sights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnitemares_2025">Fortnitemares 2025</h2><p dir="ltr">Ever since Fortnite moved to yearly chapters starting with Chapter 3, each year's Season 4 has been the home of the annual spooky Fortnitemares event that goes down each October. Fortnitemares usually involves a collab with a horror-themed IP--2024's collabs were Saw, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and the Disney Villains, and the year before that brought Halloween, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and Alan Wake. None of this year's Fortnitemares collabs have leaked yet, but there will almost certainly be multiple new item shop skins on par with the collabs mentioned above.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_Chapter_6_Season_4_map_changes">Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 4 map changes</h2><p dir="ltr">We don't know yet about new additions to the map for Season 4, but it's probably safe to assume that most, if not all, of the Star Wars locations will remain, along with Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Spots added in the middle of a chapter are not usually removed until we move on to a new island entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, the places we'd expect to be swapped out for new stuff are locations that have been there since the chapter began. Which would be Shogun's Solitude, Canyon Crossing, Shining Span, Flooded Frogs, and Pumped Power. It's also possible major new locations will be added in spots where there is currently nothing, as Epic recently did when it added the Fortress of Solitude.</p>
