                <p>This September will be the 30th anniversary of Doom's arrival on the Super Nintendo. But Limited Run isn't waiting around to get the party started. The physical-media brand has debuted the first look at the Doom SNES collector's edition, as well as the special rumble controller that will be compatible with it.</p><p>On Friday, July 11, preorders will open for <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/doom-collectors-edition-snes?_pos=2&amp;_sid=d74ea325e&amp;_ss=r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Doom collector's edition</a> and <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/doom-snes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Doom standard edition</a>, which will go for $175 and $100, respectively. Both versions include 14 new levels that weren't on the original SNES release, as well as nightmare mode, circle strafing, performance enhancements, and rumble support on playable SNES cartridges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528449" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528449"></a><figcaption>Doom collector's edition (SNES).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg"></figure><p>The collector's edition features a blood-splattered cartridge, an embossed foil box, a 12" x 16" poster, and an instruction booklet. However, it does not include a controller. If you want to try out <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-merch/products/snes-rumble-controller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the new SNES rumble controller</a>, then you'll have to order that separately for $35. Preorders for the controller will also open on July 11.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528458-snesrumblecontroler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528458" data-ratio="1.1099691675231" data-width="973" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528458-snesrumblecontroler.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528458"></a><figcaption>The first-ever SNES rumble controller.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528458-snesrumblecontroler.jpg"></figure><p>For now, Doom is the only SNES game that has rumble support. But once the controller is released, it's possible that more titles could be added in the future. 8BitDo also has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Gamepad-Original-Transparent-nintendo/dp/B092DXQYDK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;th=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a wireless SNES controller on Amazon</a>, but it doesn't have the rumble feature.</p><p>The preorder period for Doom SNES and the SNES rumble controller will run through August 10, with an estimated delivery in February 2026.</p><p>Before that arrives, the most-recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, is getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/go-behind-the-scenes-of-doom-the-dark-ages-with-this-new-art-book/1100-6532901/" data-ref-id="1100-6532901">an art book in November</a> from Dark Horse Books.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The Girls' Frontline series is back in a big way with the release of Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium—now available on PC and mobile! This free-to-play strategy RPG sequel builds on everything fans loved in the original game, now with a fully 3D battlefield, evolved mechanics, and a fresh roster of Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) ready for action.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a returning Commander or just starting out, Exilium offers a gorgeous, anime-inspired experience thanks to next-gen rendering tech, deep tactical gameplay, and a variety of mini-games to keep things fresh. It's everything you loved about the original and so much more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle-Ready T-Dolls Take the Spotlight</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326"></a><figcaption>Springfield and Peri are ready for action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest update brings new Elite T-Dolls to recruit, with increased drop-rates for Springfield, Peri, and Mechty (Rerun). Each brings their own strengths to your squad—and yes, you can deck them out in stylish outfits, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield, a powerhouse support unit, is perfect for Hydro-focused teams. Her ability to overheal and boost allies makes her an essential part of any strong lineup. She's available now in the limited-time Targeted Procurement banner, so if you've been hoarding Collapse Pieces and Targeted Access Permissions, now's your chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Pair her with the Radiance rifle: a custom Elite-class weapon designed just for her. It increases Hydro damage team-wide, boosts HP by 15%, and amplifies Springfield's key abilities. Based on the real-world M1903, this sleek rifle delivers both style and stopping power.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Peri Brings the Fire</h2><p dir="ltr">Peri–a Bulwark unit–is all about aggressive tactics. She dishes out Burn damage at the cost of her own HP, but can activate a powerful shield to stay in the fight longer. You can unlock her for free through the Standard Banner by completing event tasks during the current limited-time event.</p><p dir="ltr">Her signature weapon? A deceptively dainty SMG based on the MP5H1 that hits like a truck. And don't sleep on Faye—her elite handgun, Hestia, modeled after the CZ75, turns her into a true Goddess of Flame on the battlefield and is a portable powerhouse.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dress to Impress: Limited-Time Outfits</h2><p dir="ltr">What's a new T-Doll without a killer outfit? Several stunning looks are available at limited-time discounts:</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield's "Queen in Radiance" outfit isn't just elegant—it's also the first 3D main screen wallpaper in the game, complete with dance interactions and Scenic Tour animations.</p><p dir="ltr">Faye's "Flurry Crimson" ensemble channels her inner flame with dancer-inspired flair.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Style Up Your Arsenal</h2><p dir="ltr">Don't let your weapons feel left out, because new skins are here too! Springfield's Midnight Waltz pairs perfectly with her Radiance outfit for a dazzling ballroom blitz combo. And for a retro-futuristic edge, grab the Dawn Sentry, a stylish homage to old-school sci-fi.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Free Pulls, Codes, and a Shot at Real-World Prizes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328"></a><figcaption>Here's a closer look at all the rewards you can earn in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium is feeling generous this month, as you can grab 40 free banner pulls, the free T-Doll Faye, free Targeted Access Permissions, and more this month.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance to win prizes like the iPhone 16, Razer keyboard, and tons of in-game loot through the Defend Zucchero Café event.</p><p dir="ltr">Got a US server account?

Top cosplayers brought characters like Springfield, Makiatto, Centaureissi, and Sharkry to life, making the booth a major attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">In case you missed it, you can check out photos and videos of the Girls Frontline 2 by searching for hashtags like #GirlsFrontline2Exilium and #gfl2exilium on various social media platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're strategizing in battle or styling your T-Dolls to perfection, now's the perfect time to jump into Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium.
