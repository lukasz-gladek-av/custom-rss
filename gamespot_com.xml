                <p>Call of Duty developer Pete Actipis, who is the game director on CoD: Warzone at Raven Software, has teased Activision's plans for the OG map, Verdansk, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/" data-ref-id="2900-6387">just recently returned to the game</a>.</p><p>As many may recall, Warzone's original battle royale map was featured in the game from launch in March 2020 to December 2021. It was gone for years until its return earlier this month. Actipis told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Activision "brought Verdansk back for a reason."</p><p>"It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it," Actipis said. "So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there."</p><p>Actipis declined to get into specifics on Activision's plans and strategy for Warzone map rotation, but the developer did tease, "We love Verdansk."</p><p>Actipis added: "It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2135581852"

data-ref-id="1100-6530610">helped the game's player populations grow on Steam</a>. Actipis said the return of Verdansk has been "pretty successful" so far. Actipis pointed to Warzone having positive sentiment on Reddit as an example of how the company has turned things around to a degree at least.</p><p>"Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it," Actipis said. "We recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going."</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall.

                <p>The Advance Wars lookalike tactics game Warside, developed by Lavabird and published by First Break Labs, is out now on PC. However, fans have pointed out that it's buggy and seemingly unfinished, reflecting its Mostly Negative reception so far.</p><p>Warside looks eerily similar, if not almost identical, to Advance Wars. The maps, buildings, battles, and troops look very much like the ones in Nintendo's tactics franchise. The biggest differentiator is that the Commanders in Warside have a more realistic pixel art as opposed to Advance Wars' anime art style.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews section</a>, there are several features and gameplay mechanics that are missing. One player said that Warside feels like an early access release, with multiplayer lobbies and local multiplayer functionality nowhere to be found, even though both features were advertised as available.</p><p>Another player noted that the game's economy is broken as income needed to purchase troops is unavailable. However, it seems like the developers have already quickly fixed that issue.</p><p>Warside isn't the only game that's attempting to capture the spirit of the Game Boy Advance era, as the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-classic-fire-emblem-inspired-rpg-launches-in-march/1100-6529734/" data-ref-id="1100-6529734">Dark Deity 2</a> is inspired by Fire Emblem games from that period.</p><p>Warside currently has a 10% launch discount and will be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox at a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/warside-launches-april-14-for-pc-later-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later date</a>.</p>

In fact, the free-to-play game has clearly struck a chord with a wide swath of people, as over 125,000 people are playing it right now (at time of publication), per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/" rel="nofollow ">Bongo Cat</a> is a clicker game that sees a feline patting a taskbar with its paws as a player types or clicks a mouse. That increases your points and treasure chests will eventually appear, too, containing different types of hats.

The game is seeing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/Bongo_Cat/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">"overwhelmingly positive" reviews</a> so far on Steam.</p><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/repo-has-come-out-of-nowhere-on-steam-topping-145000-concurrent-players/1100-6530038/">REPO came out of nowhere on Steam</a> with more than 145,000 concurrent players. The cooperative horror game continues to see a steady stream of players and has even made some waves <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/r-e-p-o">on Twitch</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Even after a reveal showcase over the weekend, there was confusion about one crucial aspect regarding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a>: the game's price point. Developer Bungie has clarified that the extraction shooter won't be "a full-priced title." However, the entry cost still hasn't been detailed, with that info apparently arriving in the summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Originally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a> noted that the game would be full priced since Bungie has referred to the shooter as "a premium title." <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1911121437848371405" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, Wario64 shared those details before <a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow ">the official Marathon account</a> stepped in to spell out the current pricing situation for Marathon. Yes, it's described as a premium experience, but it won't carry a premium price tag (think $70). What the entry cost will ultimately be for the game will have to wait for a few months, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Last September, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/">reported that Marathon would cost $40</a>. There were no plans to transition to a free-to-play model at the time, and apparently the shooter was too far along in development to even make that change. Previously, Sony (which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/">now owns Bungie</a>) has released similar live-service games at the $40 price point: Helldivers 2 and Concord. Obviously, the results from those couldn't be more different, but there is clear precedent for that entry fee.</p><p dir="ltr">What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch September 23</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If that date sticks out to you, it's probably because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> will arrive on that same day. Before then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon is getting a closed alpha this month</a>. You can join <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow ">the game's Discord channel</a> for a chance to participate.</p><p dir="ltr">Marathon isn't the only game at the center of a price-point debate this month. Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/">defending the decision to launch Mario Kart World for $80</a> on Switch 2 in June. People also seem a bit taken aback that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-switch-2-welcome-tour-a-paid-game-that-explains-the-new-console-features/1100-6530546/">Switch 2 Welcome Tour isn't a pack-in experience</a> with the upcoming system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
