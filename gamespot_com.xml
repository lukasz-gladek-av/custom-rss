                <p>Beating the Ender Dragon in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft </a>technically marks the end of the game, as the credits will roll when you leave the area post-fight. However, there are several useful techniques and important mechanics that you need to know before you head into the fight with one of the strongest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs</a>. Here's how to find the Ender Dragon, how to beat it, and the rewards you'll get for slaying it.</p><h2 id="Items_to_bring_to_the_fight">Items to bring to the fight</h2><p>Before we get into the mechanics of the Ender Dragon fight, there are several items you should seek out and bring with you on the journey. You'll want to read our dedicated Minecraft The End guide for information on how to find The End and how to get there, but in terms of items that will be useful, we've got you covered.</p><p>You'll need three full stacks of scaffolding in order to reach the tops of the towers. You can bring normal blocks, but scaffolding allows you to go up and down at will, instead of relying on water buckets to break your fall from the top of the tower. If you're anything like me, you've failed at the water bucket trick too many times to count, so scaffolding is the safer option. Having said that, do bring a water bucket to protect yourself from the many Endermen that spawn in the fight arena.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497174"></a><figcaption>Suggested items to bring to the Ender Dragon fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497174-minecraft-ender-dragon.jpg"></figure><p>Bring a full stack of golden carrots to restore health if you do get hit quickly. Also, bring three stacks of empty glass bottles with you to collect the Dragon's Breath that pools on the floor. This is an important ingredient for several Minecraft potions, so it's well worth collecting while the fight progresses. To collect it, right-click with a glass bottle equipped when it pools on the floor, taking care not to step directly in it.</p><p>Bring your best weapons. For the Ender Dragon, this is a Netherite sword with your preferred enchantments, and a bow with the infinity enchantment at a minimum, as this gives you unlimited arrows. You'll also want full diamond or Netherite armor, with your preferred enchantments. If you'd prefer to avoid the Endermen completely at the sacrifice of limited vision, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet. This way, the Endermen won't attack you no matter how much you look at them.</p><p>Bring a bed and a chest with spare armor and weapons. Place the bed and chest next to the End portal, and set your respawn on the bed before jumping into the portal.</p><p>Finally, bring some stacks of building blocks, preferably cobblestone or something else similar to obtain, as the spawn into The End is random and you may find yourself on one of the area's many standalone platforms with no way to reach the Ender Dragon. Should this happen after jumping through the portal, you can create a bridge across to the main area.</p><h2 id="How_to_destroy_the_tower_crystals_and_cages">How to destroy the tower crystals and cages</h2><p>When you spawn into the Ender Dragon fight, you'll notice several pillars with End Crystals on top of them. Two of these towers will also have cages around the crystals. You'll need to climb the towers to destroy the cages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497175" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497175"></a><figcaption>Some towers have cages at the top.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497175-minecraft-ender-dragon%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>You can use your bow to shoot the crystals at the top of the towers. All of the crystals need to be destroyed, as they will heal the Ender Dragon. You can shoot the crystals from the ground, but if you're finding it difficult then use your scaffolding to ascend the tower to get a better angle to hit it from.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497176"></a><figcaption>Destroy the cages around the crystals with a pickaxe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497176-minecraft-ender-dragon%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>You will have to use the scaffolding to climb the towers to destroy the caged crystals, as the cages cannot be destroyed using projectiles. When you reach the top, use a pickaxe for the most efficient way to destroy the cage. Remember that there are two towers with cages. When the cage and crystal are destroyed, head down the scaffolding or use the water bucket to create a safe space to jump into.</p><p>If you destroy a crystal while the Dragon is tethered to it--signaled by a white beam between the Dragon and the crystal--it will cause the Ender Dragon to take more damage when the attack phase begins.</p><h2 id="How_to_avoid_being_killed_by_Endermen">How to avoid being killed by Endermen</h2><p>As mentioned above, you can carve a pumpkin and wear it as a helmet to avoid Endermen attacking you. However, the limited visibility this provides often isn't worth it. Instead, try to avoid looking at them directly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497182"></a><figcaption>An Enderman can't attack if you're stood in water.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497182-minecraft-ender-dragon%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you accidentally do look at one for too long it will become hostile. Use your water bucket and stand in the middle of where the water was placed. If you stay in this safe area, the Endermen will not get closer and therefore cannot hit you with their melee attacks. However, the Ender Dragon can still use its Dragon's Breath attack, so keep an eye out for it as it will still do damage over time while you're standing in water.</p><h2 id="How_to_kill_the_Ender_Dragon">How to kill the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You can now begin to damage the Ender Dragon. Use your bow and aim for it as it circles in the air, keeping an eye out for its Dragon Breath attacks. Remember not to look at the Endermen during this time too, as if you anger one, they'll all become hostile and can actually prove more deadly than the Dragon itself at times.</p><p>The Ender Dragon has several hitboxes on its head, body, wings, and tail. Hitting it in the head causes the most damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497192"></a><figcaption>Shoot the Ender Dragon with arrows when it's in flight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497192-minecraft-ender-dragon%284%29.jpg"></figure><p>When the Ender Dragon lands on the perch made of Bedrock in the center of the arena, it's time for the next stage of the fight. Again, hitting it on the head will cause the most damage, but be careful of its flapping wings, as they'll cause damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497193"></a><figcaption>The Ender Dragon dying</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1850/18507742/4497193-defeatingtheenderdragoniseasyinminecraft0-33screenshot.png"></figure><p>It will still be using its Dragon's Breath attack, so use the glass bottles in your inventory to quickly bottle it up, or move away from it. As the Dragon's health depletes, it will periodically return to the sky to fly around before landing again on its perch. Keep attacking it with arrows in the air, or melee attacks when it's on its perch, until it's killed.</p><h2 id="Ender_Dragon_Drops">Ender Dragon Drops</h2><p>For defeating the Ender Dragon, you will receive several items. Firstly, you will get 12,000XP in orbs, so run around and collect them all for a huge amount of level boosts. It's enough to raise your level to 68 from zero, to put that into context. If you resummon the Ender Dragon and defeat it again, it will only drop 500XP.</p><p>Secondly, the Dragon Egg will spawn. To safely get it without destroying it, follow these steps:</p><ul><li>Hit the egg once so it falls from the portal.</li><li>Mine underneath the egg and place a torch underneath the block it is sitting on.</li><li>Break the block it is sitting on, and it'll fall on the torch.</li><li>You can now pick up the egg and have it in your inventory.</li></ul><p>This also grants The Next Generation achievement. There is only one Dragon Egg in each Minecraft world, and there is no way to get more than one without using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-minecraft-mods/2900-5234/" data-ref-id="2900-5234">Minecraft mods</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497194"></a><figcaption>How to pick up the Ender Dragon Egg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497194-minecraft-ender-dragon%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, defeating the Ender Dragon opens a portal to the End Islands, which gives access to things such as Elytra and Shulker boxes. The portals appear in random locations, and look like a cluster of blocks. There can be up to 20 portals around the main island, and teleport you large distances to the End Islands.</p><h2 id="How_to_resummon_the_Ender_Dragon">How to resummon the Ender Dragon</h2><p>You'll need four End Crystals to summon the Ender Dragon for a repeat of the fight. Place one End Crystal on each side of the perch where the Ender Dragon usually rests during the fight, on the central block. This will cause four beams to shoot up, one from each crystal, which will take it in turns to point to the top of each obsidian tower to create a new End Crystal, and the Ender Dragon will respawn when all of them have spawned.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497195"></a><figcaption>Resummoning the Ender Dragon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497195-minecraft-ender-dragon%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now that you know all about the Ender Dragon, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.

                <p>The Warden is one of the deadliest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-and-existing-minecraft-mobs-animals-and-monsters/1100-6531290/" data-ref-id="1100-6531290">Minecraft mobs </a>in the game, but it's actually not supposed to be treated like a boss. The best way to deal with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>Warden is to sneak around and avoid it, so that you can access valuable Ancient City loot. However, if you find yourself curious and wanting to look him in the eye, this guide will detail which Minecraft biomes to find him in, how to spawn him, and how to beat him if running away isn't as successful as you'd like it to be.</p><h2 id="How_to_find_the_Warden">How to find the Warden</h2><p>The Warden will spawn in Deep Dark caves, and you'll be able to tell if you're in an area where he can appear, as there'll be a lot of Sculk littering the ground and walls. Sculk is a deep midnight-blue block with flecks of electric blue. It starts off sparsely dotted around, but as the cave opens up, it becomes very dense and is joined by Sculk Sensors and Sculk Shriekers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497160"></a><figcaption>The Warden will rise out of the ground when triggered.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497160-minecraft-warden.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden doesn't automatically spawn in these areas, though. Instead, a player needs to trigger four Sculk Shriekers. You'll know the Shrieker has been activated as blue sonar waves will be emitted from it. To trigger one, you need to directly step on a Sculk Sensor or cause a vibration by moving or interacting with something close to it. The sensor will then send a signal to the Shrieker, which will make a loud noise. After triggering the Shrieker, or any Shrieker, four times, a Warden will rise from the ground, and the surrounding area will get darker.</p><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Warden">How to beat the Warden</h2><p>As mentioned, the Warden isn't really intended to be fought. By sneaking around and trying to avoid it, Mojang introduced a horror-like suspense to Minecraft that'll have your heart racing. As the Warden is blind and relies on sound, vibration, and smell to seek out nearby threats, he can't detect you if you're sneaking past it. His audible heartbeat gives a good indicator of how close he is, even when the room is pitch black.</p><p>If you're going to try running from the Warden, you can distract it with throwable items like snowballs or arrows, as the noise and vibration from them landing elsewhere will entice the Warden in their direction. However, you must either sprint away as soon as it's at the distraction location or continue to sneak in the opposite direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497162"></a><figcaption>The Warden's sonic boom is a powerful ranged attack.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4497162-minecraft-warden%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Warden will react to you running, jumping, mining, building, or attacking anything and will turn and sprint towards you. If it reaches you, it has a ranged sonic boom attack which deals 6HP damage, and an even more painful melee attack dealing 16HP damage, meaning it'll make quick work of killing you unless you're out of its reach.</p><p>If you do choose to fight the Warden, one technique we've used is crafting a lot of anvils and building a tower out of its reach, dropping the Anvils on its head. It has 500 health points, so it's not easy to take down, but not impossible. Should you manage to kill it, it will drop five experience points and a Sculk Catalyst.</p><p>If you're looking for more tips and tricks, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/" data-ref-id="1100-6526408">Minecraft guides hub</a>, which covers<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-show-your-minecraft-coordinates/1100-6531264/" data-ref-id="1100-6531264"> how to show your coordinates</a> if you're lost seeking the Warden, and what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-differences-and-which-to-play/1100-6531281/" data-ref-id="1100-6531281">Java vs Bedrock </a>differences are.</p>
