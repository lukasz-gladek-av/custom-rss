However, the team behind the game wants players to know that it has listened to comments about the first beta, and expanded the hours and the options for the second weekend.</p><p>On the game's social media accounts, Gears of War Reloaded developer The Coalition announced the changes. The start time remains June 20 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET, but the test has now been lengthened by nine hours to Sunday, June 22 at 9 PM PT / June 23 12 AM ET.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/GearsofWar/status/1935414750034411784" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We heard you. <br>More maps.

All of the post-launch content from the game's first remaster, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, will be included. Microsoft has also been sending free upgrades for Reloaded to anyone who already has Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.</p><p>Microsoft will drop Gears of War Reloaded on August 28 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.

                <p>Valve released a new Steam Client Beta today, and it's focused on adding accessibility options to Big Picture Mode on PCs and SteamOS on handheld PCs like the Lenovo Legion Go S and Steam Deck.</p><p>Specifically, it is adding a UI scaling option, toggles for high contrast mode and reduced motion, and additional screen reader and color filter settings. These options can now all be found in an Accessibility sub-menu that's now part of SteamOS and Big Picture Mode's settings menus. The image below shows off exactly what this new menu looks like. With these additions, Valve now recommends that Steam users who require features such as screen readers use Big Picture Mode instead of the standard Steam client.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851" data-ratio="0.70100143061516" data-width="1398" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png" data-ref-id="1300-4517851"></a><figcaption>The new SteamOS accessibility menu with options for UI scaling, high contrast mode, reduced motion, color filters, and scren reader settings.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4517851-a042795ddde3e336612076287008ff9520af6575.png"></figure><p>SteamOS specifically will see particular benefits from the Screen Reader and Color Filter updates. For the Screen Reader, players will now be able to adjust its pitch, speed, and volume and consistently hear it read out each item being highlighted. Meanwhile, there are now filters called Greyscale, Invert Brightness, and Invert Colors that people can use to adjust how both Steam and games are displayed while using SteamOS.</p><p>All of these features are still currently part of the Steam Client Beta, and Valve has not shared when exactly they will exit the beta. It is committing to improving accessbility options on Steam, teasing that "these new settings are only the first available of the accessibility features we're working on," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements?snr=1_2108_9__2107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a blog post</a>. Steam has also added tools that allow game developers to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-just-made-it-easier-for-devs-to-promote-their-games-accessibility-features/1100-6531047/" data-ref-id="1100-6531047">highlight the accessibility features</a> in their games.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Blizzard recently blew the lid off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s upcoming 11.2 update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, and players are now convinced a new specialization for Demon Hunters could be in the cards.</p><p dir="ltr">In the official Ghosts of K'aresh preview video, a moment around the two minutes and 38 second mark with three Demon Hunters sticks out. The Demon Hunter on the left looks to be Havoc (DPS) spec, while the one on the right, wearing bulkier armor, certainly looks like a stand-in for a Vengeance (tank) Demon Hunter. The third Demon Hunter, placed prominently in the middle of the screen, is decked out in Void-themed armor and wielding warglaives of distinct purple Void energy.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CE8zcDHcMA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2CE8zcDHcMA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of a Void-powered Demon Hunter is certainly raising eyebrows, especially when combined with a datamined ability (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/did-blizzard-just-tease-a-new-demon-hunter-spec-nearly-a-decade-after-their-introduction/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Icy Veins</a>) from the upcoming 11.2 patch client literally labeled as "Demon Hunter Metamorphosis Void." That has led players to believe Blizzard is teasing a third Void-focused spec that could be coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">It certainly seems possible that Demon Hunters will receive a new way to play either as part of Ghosts of K'aresh, in a subsequent patch, or with the arrival of the game's next Midnight expansion. It's worth noting the 11.2 update will introduce a new raid, Manaforge: Omega, which includes an encounter against a mysterious council of Void-powered Demon Hunters. With that in mind, it's easy to see how the game's existing Demon Hunters could find new power in the wake of defeating this council.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard isn't announcing anything at the moment, but it wouldn't be the first time a class has received a third specialization out of the blue. During Dragonflight, Blizzard added a third, unannounced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-new-augmentation-spec-is-a-first-for-blizzard-mmo-in-more-ways-than-one/1100-6515232/" data-ref-id="1100-6515232">specialization for Evokers called Augmentation</a> that had ties to the game's ongoing story, with a raid boss even using Augmentation spells like Ebon Might prior to the specialization being officially added. Demon Hunters are currently the only class in the game with just two specializations, so receiving a third one with ties to the game's current story would make complete sense.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, players will have to wait and see what Blizzard is cooking up, but there are still plenty of other features coming in Ghosts of K'aresh for players to be excited about. The update will serve as a surprising The Burning Crusade sequel, as players travel to the destroyed Ethereal homeworld to stop Dimensius, the largest boss in WoW history. In addition to a new zone, dungeon, and raid, players will earn an upgradeable artifact cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to interact with the world in new ways. Ghosts of K'aresh will additionally add new asynchronous multiplayer features reminiscent of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Dark Souls to WoW's Delves</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when WoW's most anticipated new feature, player housing, will arrive, Blizzard still hasn't said. However, in a recent hands-on preview, we said even the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">early version of WoW's player housing system</a> already offers near-endless possibilities.</p>

Online multiplayer is also better on Switch 2 thanks to new features like Game Chat, Game Sharing, and faster download speeds. With all that new online functionality, you might be wondering if you should use a VPN with your Switch 2 when jumping online. Unlike Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5, which aren’t portable and typically connect to the same router every day, you can travel the world with your Switch 2, connecting to public Wi-Fi. As such, it might seem worthwhile to use a VPN with your Switch 2, though there are reasons to remain skeptical about their performance.</p><h2>Using a VPN on Switch 2</h2><p dir="ltr">First things first--yes, you can use a VPN on Switch 2. However, it’s not as straightforward as using a VPN on your PC. There’s no built-in VPN app for Switch 2, meaning you’ll need to either create a hotspot from another supported device or set up a VPN on your router. The latter can be tricky for beginners, and the process varies slightly depending on your specific VPN service.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re thinking of setting up a VPN on your router, consider using ExpressVPN. The company offers its own line of Aircove routers that come preconfigured to route all traffic on your network through an ExpressVPN server. There are two models available: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VBXLGJR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$190 Aircove</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM6VL4PS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$170 Aircove Go</a>. Both feature WiFi 6 support and come bundled with a 30-day ExpressVPN free trial. Any device with WiFi or Ethernet connectivity can connect to the Aircoves, including the Switch 2, your PCs, other gaming consoles, smartphones, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re traveling, you can make use of a personal Wi-Fi hotspot. While smartphones are the most commonly used hotspot devices, most cannot natively share their VPN connection via a mobile connection. Instead, you’ll need to create a hotspot on your laptop or MacBook and connect your Switch 2 to it that way. Just enable network sharing on your device, connect to your VPN, then connect your Switch 2 to your laptop’s hotspot. The process varies slightly based on your VPN provider, but most offer detailed walkthroughs.

But there are some serious considerations to make before running your data through a remote server. For one, your speeds might be slower since VPNs encrypt your data and funnel it to another server, which takes time. More importantly, using a VPN can violate Nintendo's Terms of Service (TOS).</p><p dir="ltr">For example, using a VPN to circumvent regional pricing restrictions is against Nintendo's TOS, and various online games also restrict VPN usage. Using one can result in a ban if you're caught--or worse. Nintendo can remotely--and permanently--brick consoles for users who break certain rules outlined in the Switch 2 End User License Agreement. Because these regulations vary widely by game and region, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer.</p><p dir="ltr">In general, it's not necessary to use a VPN on Switch 2 if you’re sticking to single-player games or diving into casual online matches at home. The only possible edge case is if you’re worried about sketchy public Wi-Fi networks at cafes, airports, and hotels--but even then, it might be best to not connect to public networks if you're worried, or even play in Airplane mode. Still, if you're intent on using a VPN with your Switch, just make sure you deactivate it before using the eShop and confirm that using a VPN is not against an online game's terms of service.</p><h2>Other benefits of a VPN</h2><p>While it's hard to recommend a VPN for Switch 2 in most instances, the privacy and security benefits of a VPN can be helpful for other devices. Many VPN services also offer a wealth of other features like password managers, ad blockers, cloud storage space, identity theft alerts, and more. These won't be usable with your Switch 2, but they can be helpful for logging into your Nintendo Account on your PC or smartphone and monitoring your account for any security breaches. Luckily, most VPNs are affordable, costing just a few bucks a month.
