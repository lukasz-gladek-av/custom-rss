                <p>EA and developer Full Circle's new skateboarding game, Skate, is out now for Xbox and PlayStation consoles. But what about if you want to play on Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?</p><h2><strong>Switch 2 version not planned "at the moment"</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, as of now, the new Skate is not confirmed for Nintendo's consoles. A community manager said in the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/skate-en/will-skate-be-on-switch-2/12299906/replies/12299922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA forums</a> that, "There is no Switch 2 version at the moment."</p>

<p>Skate is heading to a new platform beyond where it's available now, though, as the game is leaping to iOS and Android at a later date. For now, Skate is available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>While Skate isn't coming to Switch, or at least not yet, the Switch family of consoles does already have some skateboarding games, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 and 3+4, as well as Skate Bird, Skater XL, Session, and OlliOlli World.</p><p>On all platforms, Skate is free, with Full Circle making money from microtransactions and sales of the Founder's Pack ($25) and Founder's Pack Deluxe ($50). These bundles include various cosmetics.</p><p>The new Skate is the first entry in the series since 2010's Skate 3, so fans have been waiting a long time. The pent-up demand led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-server-queues-lead-to-complaints-about-always-online-requirement/1100-6534790/" data-ref-id="1100-6534790">server issues at launch</a>, but the experience has improved since then.</p><p>Skate is available now as an early-access game, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-to-remain-in-early-access-for-a-year-will-stay-free/1100-6534814/" data-ref-id="1100-6534814">won't get its "full" release for about a year</a>. Full Circle plans to collect feedback from players to help improve the experience for whenever the game is ready for its 1.0 debut. One thing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-to-remain-in-early-access-for-a-year-will-stay-free/1100-6534814/" data-ref-id="1100-6534814">won't change is the price tag: $0.</a></p><p>If you're just getting started with Skate, you can check out some of GameSpot's guides below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-money-in-skate-and-get-free-rewards/1100-6534796/" data-ref-id="1100-6534796">How To Make Money In Skate And Get Free Rewards</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/if-youre-playing-skate-change-these-settings-asap/1100-6534795/" data-ref-id="1100-6534795">If You're Playing Skate, Change These Settings ASAP</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-add-friends-in-skate-crossplay-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6534792/" data-ref-id="1100-6534792">How To Add Friends In Skate - Crossplay And Cross-Saves Explained</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-season-1-start-and-end-dates-what-you-can-expect/1100-6534794/" data-ref-id="1100-6534794">Skate Season 1 Start And End Dates, What You Can Expect</a></li></ul>

Chaos Armor is also guaranteed to have at least one greater affix, making them on average stronger than a typical Unique.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class had a number of Chaos Armor Uniques to choose from during the PTR, but Blizzard has sweetened the deal, adding an additional Unique that can roll as Chaos Armor for each class. They are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Barbarian - Ramaladni's Magnum Opus</li><li dir="ltr">Druid - Dolmen Stone</li><li dir="ltr">Necromancer - Mutilator Plate</li><li dir="ltr">Rogue - Scoundrel's Kiss</li><li dir="ltr">Sorcerer - Esu's Heirloom</li><li dir="ltr">Spiritborn - Sunbird's Gorget</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Come the update, Chaos Armor will be visually distinct from normal Uniques, with a greenish hue, so players can better identify them. To earn a guaranteed piece of Chaos Armor, players will want to face down the new boss Bartuc as part of the game's revamped Infernal Hordes activity. Those who are able to bring down Bartuc on Torment IV difficulty will score even more Chaos Armor drops than before. In another change, Chaos Armor drops in the game's open world will no longer replace a Unique drop, and will instead be an additional reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard additionally outlined how Season 10 will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-10-finally-ditches-boss-immunity-phases/1100-6534787/" data-ref-id="1100-6534787">rework the game's frustrating boss-immunity phases</a>. Bosses will instead gain a shield at 2/3 and 1/3 life that, if players are strong enough to deplete in five seconds, will prevent the boss from becoming immune. The shield's value at 2/3 life will be equal to 1/3 of the boss' max life, while the shield at 1/3 life will be equal to 2/3 of the boss' max life.</p><p dir="ltr">The full Diablo 4 Season 10 patch notes, filled with various bug fixes and class-balance changes, can be found below. While Season 10 does bring some significant changes, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators have teased that even bigger changes</a> are in the works, though Blizzard has not yet discussed what those might be. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's next expansion is slated to arrive sometime in 2026</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 10 Full Patch Notes</h2><h3>Updates from PTR</h3><h3>Season of Infernal Chaos</h3><h3>Chaos Rifts</h3><ul><li>Reduced the damage of the Chaos Wave projectiles.</li><li>Removed the stacking debuff system where getting hit by an attack from a Chaos Portal would increase the damage the player received.</li><li>The Chaos Rift Nightmare Dungeon Affix now gives more rewards.</li></ul><h3>Chaos Armor</h3><ul><li>Chaos Armor is now visually distinct from normal unique items.</li><li>Bartuc now has an increasing chance to drop Chaos Armor as players progress through Torment Tiers, granting more Chaos Armor at Torment IV than on the PTR.</li><li>Chaos Armor world drops are now an additional reward instead of replacing a Unique.</li><li>We’ve added New Chaos Armor to increase the heat for Season launch:  <ul><li>Barbarian - Ramaladni's Magnum Opus</li><li>Druid - Dolmen Stone</li><li>Necromancer - Mutilator Plate</li><li>Rogue - Scoundrel's Kiss</li><li>Sorcerer - Esu's Hierloom</li><li>Spiritborn - Sunbird's Gorget</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Chaos Perks</h3><h4>General</h4><p>Crazy Brew</p><ul><li>Cooldown increased from 10 to 15 seconds.

Developer Arrowhead Game Studios has heard your concerns and, in an effort to alleviate that frustration, will temporarily disable the Rupture Strain subfaction later today.</p><p>In a post on the official Helldivers 2 Discord, community manager Katherine Baskin said the Rupture Strain--that subfaction of Terminids from The Gloom--started behaving in unintended ways as a result of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-patch-tackles-cave-crashes-and-audio-bugs/1100-6534782/" data-ref-id="1100-6534782">the September 16 patch</a> and "other issues" regarding their balance. As such, these insectoids will be pulled offline today so the developers can iron out any of the kinks.</p>

<p>"No other units will be affected," Baskin said. "The improved Rupture Strain will be back online in 5 weeks."</p><p>Introduced on September 2, the Rupture Strain has been rupturing brains and straining fingers as divers of all stripes get demolished by the spider-like creatures. Since they've invaded Super Earth, the Helldivers 2 community has grown tired of trying to avoid dying in battle against these bugs. A popular post on the game's subreddit, titled "Done with the rupture strain..." and posted on September 7, lists all the ways they "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nao9qf/done_with_the_rupture_strain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">aren't fun to play against</a>." Another one, posted a day before this news came out, simply sighed at the idea that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nick9t/rupture_strain_buff_sigh/" rel="nofollow ">the</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nick9t/rupture_strain_buff_sigh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Rupture Strain was getting buffed</a>.

While the Rupture Strain will no longer roam The Gloom for the next five weeks, that doesn't mean there aren't things for you to do around Super Earth. Arrowhead Game Studios recently dropped a substantial patch that addresses myriad crashes and issues, and earlier this month, the team released the latest premium Warbound, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Dust Devils</a>, which introduced new guns, skins, and other rewards.</p>
