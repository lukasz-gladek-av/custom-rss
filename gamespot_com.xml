                <p>Capcom has announced that Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny is being remastered for PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox One. The remaster is due out sometime in 2025.</p><p>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny follows Jubei Yagyu as he fights against a demon army led by Nobunaga Oda. After Nobunaga's army slaughtered the Yagyu clan, Jubei is now on a quest for revenge. Along the way, Jubei meets others with similar goals and learns more about his oni heritage, which gives him powers to defeat Nobunaga's demons.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkO4CdJ2tc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8SkO4CdJ2tc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game was first released for PS2 in 2002, and it's the second entry in the series to get a modern remaster.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>It's been 25 years since Maxis first introduced us to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/" data-ref-id="5000-326">The Sims</a> and began wasting so, so much of our time. EA, not too surprisingly, has taken advantage of this major anniversary to re-release both The Sims and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/" data-ref-id="5000-18273">The Sims 2</a>, with all DLC included and the games updated for modern computers. And as you take this dose of nostalgia, you may find yourself looking for some cheats to help you reacquaint yourself with the original classic.</p><p>We've got you covered. Since this re-release of The Sims 1 is just that--an updated version of the existing game, rather than a remake or remaster--not much has changed about how cheating works in the original Sims title. You don't have to mess with game files or command lines or anything like that. You simply fire up the game, and once you're in it, <strong>press ctrl+shft+C to pull up the console where you can enter codes</strong>--and then enter a code.</p><p>These days, in The Sims 4, we've got a metric ton of cheats of all kinds, but The Sims 1 was simpler. While the original game has a pretty massive pile of codes that will do under-the-hood technical stuff, there are only a relatively small number of useful cheats. And at least one of them does something completely different than you'd probably expect. Let's dive in.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cheat code</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>rosebud</td><td>1,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>set_hour [1-24]</td><td>Set time of day, using a 24-hour clock. So, 5 for 5am, and 17 for 5pm.</td></tr><tr><td>autonomy [1-100]</td><td>Set sim autonomy--the higher the number, the more they'll do what they want</td></tr><tr><td>sim_speed [1-1000]</td><td>Set the speed of Live Mode--800 is default</td></tr><tr><td>interests</td><td>Shows what the selected sim is into</td></tr><tr><td>freeall</td><td>All build items are free</td></tr><tr><td>visitor_control</td><td>Allows you to command other sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>move_objects on</td><td>Allows you to pick up and move any item on the current lot</td></tr></tbody></table><p>There are three things worth noting about this list. First: While the rosebud cheat isn't worth much, you can add to it by adding ";!" on the end--each instance of ";!" you add on the end repeats the cheat. So if you add nine of them, like "rosebud;!;!;!;!;!;!;!;!;!," you'll receive 10,000 simoleons instead of 1,000.</p><p>Second: As you might have guessed from the description, the "move_objects" cheat in The Sims 1 is not the same "ignore collisions in build mode" command that it is in The Sims 4. Here, this command only allows you to pick up any item and move it or delete it--it's a totally different concept.</p><p>And, lastly: The Sims 1 doesn't have any cheat code that will instantly fill your sim's needs. So don't bother scouring the list over and over looking for it. There simply isn't a code for that in the first game.</p><p>With that, you should be set to dive headfirst into The Sims 1, whether you're coming back to an old fave or trying it out for the first time. If you have use for them, we also have our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-sims-2-cheats-for-new-legacy-edition/1100-6529244/" data-ref-id="1100-6529244">all The Sims 2 cheats</a>.</p>

                <p>EA is partying like it's 2004--and that's because the publisher is celebrating the 25th anniversary of its juggernaut franchise The Sims with brand-new re-releases of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims/" data-ref-id="5000-326">The Sims</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-2/" data-ref-id="5000-18273">The Sims 2</a> that include all their DLC and work on modern systems. Since it's been quite a while since most of us have messed with The Sims 2--EA stopped supporting the title when it released The Sims 3 back in 2009, after all--we could use a bit of a helping hand as we revisit this old classic. Fortunately, we've still got plenty of The Sims 2 cheat codes to work with.</p><p>Fortunately, The Sims 2 has <em>a lot</em> more cheats than The Sims 1 did. Like a lot of first sequels, The Sims 2 is where the series really established most of its norms--meaning that the way you can cheat in The Sims 2 is pretty similar to how you can cheat in The Sims 4. Because of that, in general, The Sims 2 is a lot easier to go back to now than The Sims 1 is.</p><p>But there is one thing that has stayed the same from the start: You <strong>press ctrl+shft+C to open the console where you can type in your cheat codes</strong>. No need to mess with any game files or anything like that--the console works by default. Once you've opened it up, just type in one of the codes below and have fun. Just keep in mind that The Sims 2 doesn't tell you if you typed it correctly, and it can be case-sensitive about some of the codes, so be sure to enter them exactly as written below.</p><p>There are two kinds of cheats in The Sims 2, the first being the kind you type into the console, and the second being interface-based. We'll start with the codes.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Cheat code</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>kaching</td><td>adds 1,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>motherlode</td><td>adds 50,000 simoleons</td></tr><tr><td>familyFunds [last name] [number]</td><td>sets the given family's funds to the stated amount</td></tr><tr><td>maxMotives</td><td>fills all needs for all sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>motiveDecay [on/off]</td><td>toggles need decay for all sims on the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>aging [on/off]</td><td>toggles aging for all sims on current lot</td></tr><tr><td>disablePuppyKittenAging [on/off]</td><td>toggles aging for pets</td></tr><tr><td>aspirationLevel [0-5]</td><td>sets the selected sim's aspiration meter</td></tr><tr><td>aspiration points [number]</td><td>adds aspiration points to the current sim</td></tr><tr><td>unlockCareerRewards</td><td>unlocks items you'd normally have to level your career to earn</td></tr><tr><td>setHour [0-23]</td><td>set the time of day according to a 24-hour clock</td></tr><tr><td>slowMotion [1-8]</td><td>slows down the game--the higher the number, the slower it goes</td></tr><tr><td>stretchSkeletion [multiplier]</td><td>makes the selected sim taller or shorter--1.5 makes you 1.5x taller.</td></tr><tr><td>moveObjects on</td><td>allows you to pick up or delete any object--this is different from MoveObjects in The Sims 4</td></tr><tr><td>setQuarterTilePlacement [on/off]</td><td>allows much more granular placement of items in build mode</td></tr><tr><td>boolProp testingcheatsenabled true</td><td>enables cheats that you activate by shift+clicking on things</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As was the case with The Sims 1, the moveObjects cheat here is not the same moveObjects in The Sims 4, which lets you place build objects closer together than the game's grid normally allows. In The Sims 2, this cheat is instead for literally moving or deleting any object in the world.</p><h2><strong>Interface cheats in The Sims 2</strong></h2><p>That last cheat is of particular interest to us here. On top of the cheats listed above, there are a lot of other cheats in The Sims 2 that you can activate by holding shift when you click on a sim or object in the game--doing so opens a new, cheat-focused pie menu that will allow you to change all sorts. In order to access this other group of cheats, <strong>you'll need to enter boolProp testingcheatsenabled true</strong> in the console, and that will activate the ability to use these UI cheats. For the most part, you'll be using cheats that you find by shift+clicking on a sim or a sim's mailbox.</p><p>There are two additional console commands that unlock some extra options. There's <strong>addNeighborToFamilyCheat [on/off]</strong>, which will add an option to add a sim to a household when you shift+click them; and there's <strong>ageSimsCheat [on/off]</strong>, which will let you set a sim's age. Scroll on for a list of stuff you can do with this other type of cheat.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">What to click</th><th scope="col">Option</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set age</td><td>choose the sim's current life stage</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set birthday</td><td>makes today the day the sim ages up</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Set aspiration</td><td>change the sim's lifetime goal</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Add to family</td><td>adds the selected sim to your household</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Change suit</td><td>change the sim's outfit</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Kill</td><td>kills the sim</td></tr><tr><td>Any sim</td><td>Make vampire/Cure vampire</td><td>turns the sim into a vampire or back into a human</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Make sim my contact</td><td>adds the selected sim to your relationships list</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Make furious with this sim</td><td>makes your sim really mad at whoever you clicked</td></tr><tr><td>Non-household sim</td><td>Add to family</td><td>adds selected sim to your household</td></tr><tr><td>Any plumbing object</td><td>Set state of cleanliness</td><td>makes your toilets, sinks and bathtubs dirty or clean</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all happy</td><td>fills needs for everyone in your household</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all needs static</td><td>freezes needs for entire household</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>House &gt; Make all needs dynamic</td><td>turns needs back on</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Make me know everyone</td><td>adds everyone in the world to your relationship list</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Make friends for me</td><td>makes everyone on your relationship list your best friend</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Neighborhood &gt; Invite all neighbors</td><td>every sim in the neighborhood shows up at the current lot</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Make NPC</td><td>spawns an NPC of the specified type</td></tr><tr><td>Mailbox</td><td>Make Pet</td><td>spawns a pet of the specified type</td></tr></tbody></table><p>And with that, you've got everything you need to get your Sims 2 dynasty up and running. If you need them, we also have a list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-sims-1-cheats-for-legacy-edition/1100-6529241/" data-ref-id="1100-6529241">all The Sims 1 cheats</a>.</p>

                <p>The latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> episode, Heresy, has arrived and with it plenty of big changes to classes. Tons of tweaks to the Arc subclass along with updates across the board have introduced some brand-new build possibilities. Here are three excellent builds for--one each for Titan, Warlock, and Hunter--that use some of the new features along with some different builds utilizing artifact perks. These include suggestions on which Exotic weapons, Fragments, Aspects, and Supers to combine for an effective and fun class setup.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Arc Warlock</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438953"></a><figcaption>An Arc Warlock build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438953-destiny2heresy-arcwarlock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The adjustments to the Arc subclass introduce a new mechanic known as <strong>Bolt Charge</strong>, which is a stacking elemental damage perk that unleashes a chain lightning burst when the stacks are full. Multiple sources of damage, including class abilities, will build up stacks of Bolt Charge. This build for Warlocks utilizes tons of Arc damage sources from both weapons and abilities to make the best use of it.</p><p dir="ltr">For armor, one of the best choices of Exotic is the <strong>Geomag Stabilizers</strong>. Extending the duration of your Chaos Reach Super will build up Bolt Charge stacks, and spreading Arc Damage around is crucial for making the most out of the new mechanic– these boots will help do just that. The patch released alongside the launch of Heresy changed Geomag Stabilizers to leverage Bolt Charge stacks: Sprinting while near maximum stacks will fill up the charges to unleash the attack from Bolt Charge.</p><p dir="ltr">The best weapon to pair with this build is the exotic Fusion Rifle <strong>Delicate Tomb</strong>. With its ability to generate Ionic Traces for Super energy and additionally adding more stacks of Bolt Charge. Delicate Tomb was also buffed for Episode Heresy with better chances to generate Ionic Traces, increased damage in PvE, and now the Tempest Cascade buff will last until the weapon is fired.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass to use for this build is <strong>Stormcaller</strong> with the <strong>Chaos Reach</strong> Super, the Ball Lightning melee attack, and Flashbang Grenade. For the Aspects choose <strong>Electrostatic Mind</strong> for increased creation of Ionic Traces when defeating Blinded or Jolted targets, and <strong>Ionic Sentry</strong> for the new autonomous turret. Defeating targets with Arc abilities or weapons will build up charges for an Ionic Sentry, which is then deployed by using a Grenade attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Class Fragments for this build should be <strong>Spark of Resistance</strong> for increased damage resistance while surrounded, <strong>Spark of Discharge</strong> which spawns extra Ionic Traces on Arc weapon final blows, S<strong>park of Beacons</strong> for blinding explosions on Heavy weapon final blows or special final blows, and <strong>Spark of Shock</strong> which debuffs targets hit by grenade attacks with Jolt.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Glaive Titan</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438951"></a><figcaption>A Void Titan build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438951-destiny2heresy-voidtitan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This setup is for melee-loving Titan players. Utilizing the recent buffs to Destabilizing Rounds, which detonates enemies hit by Void weapons after dealing damage with Void abilities, this build centers around lots of close-quarters fighting.</p><p dir="ltr">The main Exotic armor for Titans using this build should be <strong>Synthoceps</strong>. When a player is surrounded by enemies, they gain buffs to melee and Super damage as well as faster weapon reload speed and weapon handling. While using a Glaive, the melee buff is further applied using the weapon's close-range attack.</p><p dir="ltr">An excellent Exotic weapon to combine with this build is the class-exclusive Glaive <strong>Edge of Action</strong> from The Witch Queen expansion. Glaives combine both ranged and melee attacks and because of the emphasis on being Surrounded, further buffs from Synthoceps will make this weapon even stronger. As the Glaive builds up energy from hits with the ranged component, the special ability, Remote Shield, is triggered on full stacks. The next shot fired will put down a small dome shield wherever it is aimed at the ground. Hop inside the shield for extra defense and any enemy that comes inside the shield bubble is blinded and slowed.</p><p dir="ltr">For the subclass, Titans will need to be using <strong>Sentinel</strong> with the <strong>Twilight Arsenal</strong> Super. The Super can be exchanged for any other, as this build is not fully dependent on it, but Twilight Arsenal is the best all-rounder for the way this build functions. For class Aspects, the main one to choose is <strong>Controlled Demolition</strong>, which debuffs a target with Volatile when they're hit by a Void ability or another Volatile explosion. <strong>Bastion</strong> is an excellent second choice for the Void overshield on use of the Void Super.</p><p dir="ltr">The Class Fragments for this build are <strong>Echo of Exchange</strong>, which grants grenade energy after a melee kill; <strong>Echo of Undermining</strong>, which weakens targets hit by grenade attacks; <strong>Echo of Persistence</strong>, which enhances Void-based buffs such as Overshield; and <strong>Echo of Leeching</strong>, which starts healing players and nearby allies upon a melee kill.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Prismatic Hunter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4438958"></a><figcaption>A Prismatic Hunter build for Destiny 2 Episode Heresy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4438958-destiny2heresy-prismatichunter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This build leverages an underutilized and largely unknown synergy between two Exotic items for large area-of-effect damage combined with the new Bolt Charge mechanics. When used correctly, players can expect to clear rooms in a hurry and deal lots of damage to more hearty targets quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Exotics to use in this build, the two main choices are the <strong>Mothkeeper's Wraps</strong> gauntlets and the weapon <strong>Ex Diris</strong>. Mothkeeper's Wraps transforms the grenade ability into a bomb that releases two moths, one that applies a small Void overshield to you and a second that seeks a nearby target and explodes, causing the enemy to be blinded. Ex Diris is a special grenade launcher that shoots a large Arc projectile that detonates on impact. After a kill or rapid direct hits with it, its special perk spawns an additional moth that will seek nearby targets and explode, causing a blinding effect. Additionally, Ex Diris can shoot faster when dealing damage rapidly or the player takes sustained damage over time and survives.</p><p dir="ltr">The subclass Hunters will want to use for this one is <strong>Prismatic</strong>. For the grenade slot, any grenade can apply here, but the best option is <strong>Strand Grapple</strong>. The melee attack for this build works best with <strong>Snare Bomb</strong>, which lets players throw a small smoke bomb at a target that deals damage over time and disorients them. Aspects for this build use <strong>Stylish Executioner</strong> and <strong>Threaded Specter</strong>. Stylish Executioner will turn players invisible upon a kill with either a grenade or a melee ability, and the next melee attack while invisible will weaken a target. Threaded Specter spawns a Strand clone of the player when they use the Hunter's dodge ability that attracts enemies to it that detonates after a few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Facet of Protection</strong> will boost damage resistance while surrounded and the effect is even stronger while using the Transcendence special ability. <strong>Facet of Dawn</strong> will grant players Radiance upon a powered melee kill, which increases weapon damage from Solar element sources and causes a heal over time. <strong>Facet of Purpose</strong> will grant an elemental shield based on the chosen Super's element. <strong>Facet of Dominance</strong> causes Arc grenades to Jolt targets, which is applied via Ex Diris and the Mothkeeper's Wraps special bombs.</p>
