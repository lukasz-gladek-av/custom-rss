                <p>Last year, Epic Games brought back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale-review-laying-the-foundatio/1900-6416891/" data-ref-id="1900-6416891">Fortnite</a>'s original island in a month-long event called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-4-season-5-update-revealed/2900-4930/" data-ref-id="2900-4930">Fortnite OG</a>. The chance to revisit the earliest version of the game was wildly popular with players, and now reports are emerging that Fortnite OG will be returning on a permanent basis starting in December.</p><p>Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/hypex/status/1853920988594930095?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HypeX</a> were the first to report the news. The first 10 seasons of Fortnite, which collectively make up Chapter 1, are said to be returning on a monthly basis, and only the OG loot will be supported. Additionally, both Fortnite's battle royale mode and Zero Build modes will be incorporated into OG.</p><p>When Fortnite OG launched in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-breaks-its-all-time-player-records-at-launch/1100-6518929/" data-ref-id="1100-6518929">over 44.7 million users logged in to play</a>, which marked the most popular single day in the history of the game. That massive response surely played a role in the decision to bring Fortnite OG back alongside the current incarnation of the game.</p><p>None of this has been confirmed by Epic Games yet, but the report suggests that the official reveal may occur during Fortnite Remix's finale on November 30, or during The Game Awards on December 13. Mind you, this is all likely to occur alongside the presumed Chapter 6 map, too.</p><p>But before Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 comes to an end, rapper <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">Eminem will return to the game</a> on November 7. If players can defeat Eminem in battle, they'll earn his new Mythic RG Minigun, which can fire bullets and lines from Eminem's raps. And if that's not enough for players, Fortnite Chapter 6 is set to launch on December 1, shortly after the Remix finale event concludes.</p>

This new edition expands the book with two additional chapters and a new chili recipe written by Rogers.

                <p>Nearly a year ago, Rockstar Games debuted the first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2025-release/1100-6518649/" data-ref-id="1100-6518649">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, which marks the franchise's first sequel since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> in 2013. Fans had been hoping that today's fiscal report for Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, would include a new GTA 6 trailer. While that didn't happen, Take-Two did confirm that the GTA sequel is still on track for a fall 2025 release.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that some of the company's previous games have slipped from their originally announced release dates. However, he expressed his confidence that GTA 6 would make its release window. Zelnick also stressed that the extended development of the game is more centered on enhancing the experience rather than ironing out bugs.</p><p>"In the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs, it's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do," explained Zelnick. "And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p><p>The company noted in this year's fiscal statements that GTA 5 has sold 205 million copies to date across all platforms, while Red Dead Redemption 2 had 67 million copies to its name. Take-Two also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Borderlands 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/" data-ref-id="5000-640433">Mafia: The Old Country</a> are set to be released during the company's fiscal 2026, which should fall between April 1, 2025, and March 31, 2026. The other upcoming titles mentioned by name, CSR Racing 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-successor-judas-is-a-procedurally-generated-roguelite/1100-6522180/" data-ref-id="1100-6522180">Judas</a>, don't have release windows yet.</p>
