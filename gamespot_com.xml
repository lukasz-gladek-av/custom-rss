                <p>Diablo 4's next class could be the long-awaited Paladin, if the name of an internal build recently spotted on Blizzard's servers is to be believed.</p><p dir="ltr">As originally spotted by Spanish site <a href="http://diablonext.com/" rel="nofollow ">DiabloNext</a> (via <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/d4/news/paladin-class-may-join-diablo-4-in-upcoming-expansion/" rel="nofollow ">Icy Veins</a>), an internal build for Diablo 4 named "2.5.Xpaladin.67961" allegedly made its way to Blizzard's servers, seemingly hinting that a Paladin class could be in the works.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2.5 numbers in the build name appear to be referring to patch 2.5, which would line up with Diablo 4 Season 11, since Season 9 is currently on patch 2.3. Though it seems unlikely Blizzard would release the Paladin before a major expansion (which would see the build number jump to the 3.0 designation), it's possible some part of a Paladin class might be included as part of the patch 2.5 update, even if the class isn't fully playable or is only included for testing purposes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549754"></a><figcaption>The Paladin as seen in Diablo 2: Resurrected.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4549754-6409099949-38666.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As explained by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/it-might-finally-be-time-for-paladins-to-debut-in-diablo-4-updated-encrypted-378150" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, previous Diablo 4 builds have used the codename Fenris, making the build name change to Paladin even more curious. The name change could simply be another codename that has no actual bearing on in-game content, like Fenris. Until Blizzard makes an official announcement, it's impossible to know for sure.</p><p dir="ltr">Paladin is one of two original Diablo 2's classes that have yet to appear in Diablo 4, and as such is by far the most-requested class among the game's community. It would hardly be surprising then if Paladin does show up as part of the game's next expansion, which is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">arrive sometime in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo content creators have been hyping up Diablo 4's future in recent weeks, with some having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">attended a secret meeting</a> to learn more about what's next and others even <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1956009614019035397" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being flown</a> out to Blizzard HQ to give hands-on feedback on a new feature. Might they be testing the Paladin? That's unclear, but what is clear is that Blizzard certainly seems to be gearing up for some bigger announcements.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's Diablo team has been shaking things up in more ways than one recently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Diablo franchise head Rod Fergusson left Blizzard</a> after five years, and the studio announced it would be making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">big changes to how it talks to the Diablo 4 community</a>, doing away with its Campfire Chat livestreams and instead hosting a live chat through Discord. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">Diablo 4 is also being prepped to release in China</a>, having received government approval last month. Blizzard even seemed to tease <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">new content for Diablo 2</a> to celebrate the game's 25th anniversary, though nothing has officially been announced.</p>

Co-op has always been central to the Borderlands games, as well as its spin-off, Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, so it shouldn't be too surprising that the feature is back and seemingly better than ever in Borderlands 4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Amon Character Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For one, Borderlands 4 continues the franchise's streak of including split-screen co-op for up to two players, and allowing those players to then take their game online. This means that the game will be able to support a full online party of four players where each duo is sharing a screen.</p><p>The same Wire post makes mention of the fact that Borderlands 4 will apparently have a streamlined lobby system, the ability to freely drop in and out of sessions, and dynamic level scaling, which has long been a staple of the franchise.</p><p>As an interesting new wrinkle, Borderlands 4 will introduce the ability for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/" data-ref-id="1100-6533956">vault hunters</a> to teleport to one another. In the past, Borderlands has allowed for teleportation between fast-travel spots, and even offered vehicles for players to speed up the process of moving through the world manually, but it has never outright allowed players to zip to one another's side in an instant like this.</p><p>The change seems to be motivated by Borderlands 4's new open-world design, which moves the series away from the zone-based approach the games have typically employed. As a result, Kairos, the upcoming game's entirely new setting, is seemingly quite large and designed with plenty of points-of-interest dotted around the map that might draw players in different directions. There don't appear to be systems limiting how far apart players can be, so squads can theoretically divide and conquer during a session and then come back together if a skirmish starts getting too tough.</p><p>Despite the introduction of this new form of fast travel, Borderlands 4 will once again feature player vehicles in the form of the personal Digirunners, and even appears to feature new movement mechanics, like balloons the player can use to zip up into the sky and then glide through the immediate area.</p><p>In short, when you boot up Borderlands 4 there will be a bevy of quality-of-life features ensuring that you and your vault-hunting friends have a painless time getting around and playing together. Borderlands 4 launches on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 12, and will be coming to Switch 2 a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

Players will create new "timerunner" characters and experience faster leveling times, increased reputation gains, and an accelerated weekly content lockout schedule to make progressing even faster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nb0me06Fvcs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nb0me06Fvcs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are, however, some big changes from last year's remix event, as recently <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224370/watch-the-latest-wowcast-to-learn-about-legion-remix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outlined</a> by Blizzard. Instead of Mists of Pandaria Remix's ever-upgrading cloak and gem system, Legion Remix will instead double down on Legion's expansion-defining Artifact weapons. Players will earn an upgrade currency that can be used to upgrade their Artifacts even further than in the original Legion, with new upgrade trees that will see players embracing one of five different damage types--Nature, Fel, Arcane, Storm, or Holy. They'll also be able to find jewelry slot items that can add additional ranks to Artifact traits, increasing the weapon's power even further. Thankfully, players will be able to freely respec their Artifact weapon traits at any time.</p><p dir="ltr">Power for power's sake is nice, but Blizzard is introducing some additional challenges for players to put their upgraded Artifact weapons to the test. A new feature inspired by Diablo's world tiers will allow players to upgrade the difficulty of the game's open-world content to Heroic. Enemies will have more health and, in another move from Diablo, affix-like buffs that will make them even more difficult to overcome but yield greater rewards. In yet another page from Diablo's playbook, powerful shrines, called Timewarped Obelisks, can be found through the open world that grant players powerful temporary buffs. As Legion introduced the Mythic+ dungeon system, it will be back in Legion Remix with the expansion's original affixes, as well as four new ones for players to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">A major part of the appeal of Mists of Pandaria Remix was as a means to earn exclusive cosmetics or hard to obtain items from the original expansion. Legion Remix is no different, though Blizzard has taken some criticism from the last go around. A frequent complaint during Pandaria Remix was that it was annoying that the event's central currency, Bronze, was used to both purchase cosmetics but also to upgrade gear, often making players choose between the two.</p><p dir="ltr">Bronze is coming back for Legion Remix, but this time it will only be used for buying cosmetics. Gear upgrades will instead come from simply doing more difficult content, which should eliminate some of the tension found in Pandaria Remix between upgrading or buying event-exclusive cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">On the cosmetics front, players will be able to earn all kinds of new loot, including fel-infused versions of Legion's class mounts and a corrupted version of Varian Wrynn's swords. Blizzard is promising "plenty of never-before-released mounts, transmog sets, and more" as part of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas Pandaria Remix released with all of the expansion's content at once, Legion Remix will instead roll out Legion's content updates every two weeks. Each update will increase the maximum item level players can achieve. In a change from Pandaria Remix, characters can be transferred from Legion Remix to the current, The War Within version of the game early as opposed to having to wait for weeks until the end of the event. Transferred characters will be stripped of their Remix-specific items and abilities and given a new set of level-appropriate gear, though Blizzard warns that transferring a character early is a one-way trip and can't be undone.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know exactly when Legion Remix will arrive, but it will likely be in the next 6-8 weeks, in keeping with Blizzard's fairly consistent update cadence. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">WoW's latest 11.2 update, Ghosts of K'aresh</a>, took players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals. The update looks to perfectly tee-up WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, which is set to be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>.</p>

As we approach the game's release, I spoke with lead character designer Nick Thurston to delve into the abilities, creation, and play style of Amon, a warrior-poet and Viking-inspired warrior who offers a little bit more gameplay complexity for fans who want that in a Borderlands game. Our conversation is detailed below, edited for both brevity and readability.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, Borderlands 4 is all about stopping a world-ending threat and uncovering the location of a treasure-filled Vault on an alien planet as one of four Vault Hunters. Along the way, you'll run across a truly enormous number of unique firearms and fight through hordes of monstrous creatures, vengeful dictators, and murderous machines, all while befriending (or growing increasingly exasperated by) a network of quip-loving characters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 adds several long-requested features</a> that fans have wanted in the series as well, like mission replay and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/">seamless world</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Amon Character Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on September 12, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-on-switch-2-will-run-mostly-at-30fps-will-also-support-joy-con-mouse-controls/1100-6533370/">Switch 2 version</a> slated for release on October 3.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So earlier, y'all described Amon as "the most complicated yet approachable Vault Hunter to date." What does that mean?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nick Thurston</strong>: Yeah, I mean, complexity can mean a whole bunch of different things depending on your lens, but I think when people talk about Amon being complex, it's just the fact that he has so much that he can do as far as abilities. Historically, most Vault Hunters have "I press a button" [abilities. It's fire and forget, and [you set up] a nuke or a buff over time.</p><p dir="ltr">Amon's stuff is all about summoning a thing and doing a bunch of damage, but then he has a press one button and that does one thing, or press a different button and hold that to do another thing. Sometimes, through customization options, you can double tap your action skill button to do two different things and then press and hold to do a third different thing.</p><p dir="ltr">He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills. I wouldn't say he's super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he's a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549723"></a><figcaption>Physically, Amon is one of the largest Vault Hunters to date, rivaling Brick.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549723-bl2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How early into Borderlands 4's development did the Vault Hunters like Amon get finalized, gameplay-wise?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It really just depends, which isn't a great answer. A lot of times, we work in phases where we're like, "Here's the theme. Okay, now that's locked in. Here's action skill one. Now that's locked in. Here's action skill too. Now that's locked in."</p><p dir="ltr">And then sometimes even though we do it and we're happy with it, a year into development, when we start actually playing the game, the game fully comes online, and you can actually do combat. There's been times where we've had a fully realized action skill and where we're like, "Oh, this isn't going to work in our game." Maybe it was cool on paper in a test map, but in real gameplay, it doesn't work.</p><p dir="ltr">So sometimes we have to scrap the whole thing, and that's devastating. That's the worst part. But ultimately, what happens is Vault Hunters evolve over time pretty organically, and by the time that it ends up in the user's hands, it's something that we're really confident in.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549725"></a><figcaption>To match Borderlands 4's darker tone, the team decided to make the Siren character, Vex, much spookier this time around.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549725-bl3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How does the team decide which Vault Hunter gets to be in the next game? What sort of process did Amon go through where the team figured out that the fantasy Viking needed to be picked?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot of nuance, but different people get rolled onto the project at different times. When I get rolled on, it's usually they have some concepts of where they want to go. Sometimes it's tied to narrative hooks where they're like, "Here's a darker theme which is going to go with our darker game. We want to operate in this space for this character."</p><p dir="ltr">That's an example of Vex where we were like, "The tone of the game is going to be a little bit darker. We haven't really had a dark-leaning Siren before, so <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">what if we had a Siren that had spooky powers</a>?" And by the time I rolled onto [the project], that was already a thing that was established, but then I had to flesh it out and realize it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes, however, we only have this general idea of, "Hey, we need a brute character. We need someone who's big and beefy. We need a guy that's going to make enemies tremble in their boots just by seeing him."</p><p dir="ltr">And that was Amon. And Amon was an entirely different Vault Hunter when I started and went through a bunch of [iterations], but a lot of it didn't work out. And needless to say, we ended up switching over to Amon, and I actually had quite a bit of agency with who I thought Amon should be and what he should act like his powers should be. In a lot of ways, Amon is the one I'm most proud of, but that's because I've had the most influence on him.</p><p dir="ltr">But to go back to your point about how we deal with having a bunch of ideas: We constantly have ideas and we're throwing away ideas. We're not going to talk about DLC Vault Hunters [in this interview], but we did say that we are going to have them [in Borderlands 4]. And in that scenario, we actually polled the company and we were like, "Hey, does anyone have ideas?"</p><p dir="ltr">And we had probably, I don't know, 50 to a hundred ideas pitched. Some of them are like, "Oh, this could be a thing." And some of them are like, "Oh, the technology isn't there." And some of them are like, "This needs to be more fleshed out." Sometimes we'll combine ideas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549726"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 is a seamless world, the first in the series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549726-bl4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I love that you talk about Amon like he's your baby.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I think they're all my children. [laughs] It's hard to choose. People are like, "Who are you going to play?" And I'm like, "I don't want to pick between my kids."</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>In trailers, we see Amon primarily use incendiary and cryo damage in his abilities. Any narrative significance to these elements that necessitated their inclusion as opposed to others, like corrosive or shock?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's much less narrative. When it comes to picking elements, it's much more about the gameplay. Borderlands, as you know, has elemental matching where fire against fleshy enemies deals more damage, shock destroys shields, corrosive melts armor, [etc]. We always have to look at the elemental grid that we have and [make sure] every Vault Hunter [has] their own gameplay hooks, their own strengths and weaknesses.</p><p dir="ltr">When we're thinking about the elements that we say, "This is the primary character," we're really trying to identify what are his strengths and his weaknesses. Fire and ice, I just think go together aesthetically. I think there's some poetry there. He also has a lot of shock stuff, but that's more of a secondary thing. But yeah, I mean really we just want to create different experiences. If every Vault Hunter was good at fire damage, then fire would be less interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549722" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549722"></a><figcaption>Amon's abilities primarily deal incendiary and cryo damage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549722-bl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>With </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/"><strong>Borderlands 4 adopting a seamless world</strong></a><strong>, how far can I throw one of Amon's axes? This is important Nick, I need numbers for my future career in trick shot compilations. [laughs]</strong></p><p dir="ltr">[laughs] I'll have to get you hard numbers later, but you can do some absolutely silly trick shots.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Excellent.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It won't shock me if there [is] a YouTube video where it's like, "There's an enemy this far in front of me and I'm going to chuck [Amon's axe] up in the air," and then six seconds later it'll finally come down and hit [the enemy] in the head.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>If you aren't being silly in a Borderlands game, then what are you even doing? Speaking of, so much of Borderlands' narrative is tied to humor. How does Amon fit into that? What type of jokes does he bring to the table?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The big, brute character is often dumb, but Amon is definitely very smart, and that is all about his upbringing. He was a part of a cult as a child, and his family died from a Vault monster so now he's filled with rage and filled with the need to exact revenge. But as you can see from a lot of the dialogue from the quips in the gameplay trailers, he's actually a very warm person, and he actually speaks in this warrior poet, almost scripture kind of way. If I had to equate him to [a trope in humor], he's the straight man.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Narratively, both Vex and Rafa have strong ties to long-standing pieces of Borderlands lore: the Sirens and Tediore. Is Amon also a callback to something familiar or is he mostly connected to a brand-new piece?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">He does not have any direct ties to anything that fans would know about. Of course, long-time fans are aware of both Vault monsters and how they're tied to the Eridians, and we'll be diving into a little bit of familiar lore there as far as, "Oh, there's cults that worship these Vault monsters that fans know about." So that will be familiar. But everything about who his family worshiped and stuff--I don't know if we will explicitly talk about it [ahead of launch], but that is all brand new stuff.</p>
