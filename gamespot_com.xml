                <p>Mistborn fans may be able to take to the virtual streets of Luthadel eventually, but not for a while. As part of the yearly "State of the Sanderson" <a href="https://www.brandonsanderson.com/blogs/blog/state-of-the-sanderson-2025#video-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, author Brandon Sanderson shared that he has been in conversations with multiple AAA developers about a potential Mistborn project. If the project does come to fruition, it will be years away.</p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson seems to be optimistic about the project's chances. He wrote, "I feel I’m finally getting established enough that we can make a Mistborn game happen. ... This is at Step One only, but it’s an encouraging One." Though he doesn't name any names, he does claim that he has been chatting with big players in the industry, including ones he is a fan of himself. Sanderson is also seeking maintain his rights to video game adaptations of Mistborn.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that these discussions are in the earliest possible stage. "These rights were tied up with the film rights for the last... oh, six-seven years," Sanderson wrote, "so I didn’t get to test the market on them until recently." Sanderson concluded that any studio or publisher interested in developing a Mistborn or Stormlight project should get in touch with his representatives.</p><p dir="ltr">Mistborn is one part of Brandon Sanderson's sprawling Cosmere setting, which also encompasses the Stormlight Archive series. Multiple tabletop games based on Sanderson's work have emerged in recent years, including <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-rpgs-based-on-brandon-sandersons-novels-are-cheap-right-now/1100-6523355/">Cosmere tabletop RPGs</a> and <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mistborn-saga-deckbuilding-game-brandon-sanderson/1100-6532518/">a Mistborn deckbuilder.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sanderson himself has some professional experience related to video games. He designed the world and created characters for <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/moonbreaker-is-a-brandon-sanderson-video-game-universe-designed-to-last/1100-6508189/">the tactics game Moonbreaker</a>. Should this project release, it would not be Mistborn's first foray into video games. A project called "Mistborn: Birthright" was in development for a few years before being canceled. Protagonist Kelsier was a guest character in Fortnite, owing to Sanderson's long-standing relationship with Epic.</p>

                <p>Prolific video game voice actor Troy Baker said he believes the generative AI revolution is a "good thing," in that it will push people to seek out "authentic" experiences made by artists as opposed to AI "gruel."</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/we-interview-troy-baker-could-we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Baker said there is no doubt "AI can make content way better than humans" and can "crank it out no problem." It is important to remember, however, that what AI makes is merely content, not art, Baker said.</p><p dir="ltr">"AI can create content but it cannot create art," Baker said. "And the reason why is because that invariably requires the human experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"There's a fundamental premise to making art that people are not remembering right now, and it's that it requires artists. People go, 'Look what AI can do.' It's like, 'Yeah, okay. I see what it's capable of doing. It doesn't matter.' And we don't need to diminish it, we don't need to denigrate it, we don't need to demonize it. We need to just go, 'okay, it's there.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Baker said from a business perspective, AI is threatening, but that AI may actually be beneficial to artists in the long run.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I see happening is that this birth of AI, and this burgeoning industry of it, is actually going to drive people to the authentic," Baker said. "And we're going to see opportunities of, 'I want to go and watch this person sing this song live.' 'I want to see theater.' 'I want to read books.' 'I want to have this first-hand experience as opposed to the gruel that gets distilled to me through a black mirror.' I think that it's a good thing. It's a revolution."</p><p dir="ltr">AI use in game production, and AI voices, has become a hot-button issue in recent years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actor-strike-ends-today/1100-6532363/" data-ref-id="1100-6532363">SAG-AFTRA video game actors strike</a> that ended last year revolving around actor protections in regards to AI. Despite vocal pushback from some players, certain developers have continued to move forward using AI to help create their games. Embark Studios, the developer behind last year's extraction-shooter-hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, uses <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">AI to generate NPC voices</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, actors like Matthew McConaughey and Michael Caine have signed deals allowing for their vocies to be used by AI. Despite James Earl Jones dying in 2024, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">AI version of the Darth Vader voice actor's voice appeared in Fortnite</a> last year, where it quickly generated headlines due to players tricking the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/darth-vader-could-say-the-f-word-in-fortnite-for-a-brief-time/1100-6531608/" data-ref-id="1100-6531608">AI into saying the F word and racial slurs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Baker, who is a member of SAG-AFTRA, recently received acclaim for his portrayal of Indiana Jones in MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. Indiana Jones actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-praises-troy-baker-and-the-lack-of-ai-for-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/1100-6529281/" data-ref-id="1100-6529281">Harrison Ford himself praised Baker's performance</a> and said "[Baker] did a brilliant job, and it didn't take AI to do it."</p>

This multi-step quest requires you to find multiple spots of interaction, as well as recover some specific pieces of loot. It can take some time to figure all of this out on your own, so we've put together a step-by-step process to get you through it.</p><p>Note that each part of this quest can be completed across multiple runs, so there's no need to wrap it all up in a single raid. That being said, you'll need to extract with the Magnetron and Flow Controller items once you find them, so it's probably best to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket or two to ensure you don't accidentally lose these precious items if you find them during your raid.</p><p>Here's how to complete Snap and Salvage in Arc Raiders.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_the_rovers_in_the_Sandbox_and_how_to_take_a_photo_of_them">Where to find the rovers in the Sandbox and how to take a photo of them</h2><p>To take a photo of the rovers in the Sandbox, you'll need to make your way to (surprise!) the Sandbox POI on the bottom layer of the map.

As such, try to get in and get out while staying on the lookout for other raiders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594" data-ratio="0.56306760847629" data-width="1982" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602594"></a><figcaption>Here's where to find the rovers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602594-19a8393c96d86-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you reach the lower area in the Sandbox where there is a lot of sand (surprise again!), you'll spot some rovers in plain sight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602595"></a><figcaption>Take a photo of a rover to complete this part of the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602595-19a8393d6e048-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Once you arrive, you can simply walk up to a rover to get a yellow prompt allowing you to photograph it.

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>, the beloved spin-off that was developed by Obsidian Entertainment. Bethesda hasn't entrusted the franchise to many other developers, and according to studio boss Todd Howard, Obsidian was the only choice to take on New Vegas.</p><p>"They were the only choice," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/crawl-out-through-the-fallout" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/todd-howard-says-obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-aside-from-the-studios-fallout-dna-devs-did-something-similar-with-star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "They had done something similar with [Star Wars] Knights of the Old Republic 2, and we knew them really well. We knew we were going onto Skyrim, the franchise was back, but we knew there was going to be a long break until Fallout 4--how can we keep this going?"</p><p>Obsidian was founded by ex-Interplay and Black Isle Studios devs who previously worked on the original Fallout as well as a canceled version of Fallout 3. That made the studio a natural home for New Vegas. Howard also said that the only note Bethesda had ahead of development was to focus on the game's warring factions and the players' ability to choose between them.</p><p>"The thing that made New Vegas special was the ferocious focus on choice-and-consequence gameplay," added John Gonzalez, the lead creative designer for New Vegas. "It's all about allowing the player to have tremendous amounts of narrative impact, narrative control."</p><p>Celebrity gamer--and the voice of New Vegas' ghoul mechanic, Raul Alfonso Tejada--Danny Trejo recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">demanded a New Vegas remaster</a>. For now, there's only a pricey <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6536671/" data-ref-id="1100-6536671">Fallout: New Vegas 15th anniversary collector's bundle</a> coming in June 2026 that's retailing for $155. And that's only for PC users.</p><p>Howard has remained elusive about the status of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, which isn't expected to arrive until well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. But he has said that Fallout is "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-is-the-franchise-that-bethesda-is-doing-the-most-in-right-now/1100-6536889/" data-ref-id="1100-6536889">the franchise that we're doing the most in right now</a>."</p><p>The current second season of Prime Video's Fallout series is set in and around New Vegas.</p>
