                <p>Esteemed Polish development studio CD Projekt Red has a number of projects in development, including a remake of the 2007 original The Witcher game. It appears to still be relatively early days for the game, but there are already some key details to know. In this post, we're rounding up everything you need to know.</p><p>In addition to The Witcher remake, CD Projekt is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel,</a> a new Witcher game codenamed Project Sirius, and a new IP codenamed Project Hadar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260" data-ratio="0.55088495575221" data-width="904" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4428260"></a><figcaption>The Witcher is getting a remake.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4428260-screenshot2025-01-15at2.31.09pm.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_">When will The Witcher remake be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</a></li><li><a href="#The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_The_Witcher_remake_be_released_"><strong>When will The Witcher remake be released?</strong></h2><p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced The Witcher remake in October 2022</a>, and there is no word on a release date as of yet.</p><h2 id="Preorder_The_Witcher_remake">Preorder The Witcher remake</h2><p>Preorders for The Witcher remake are not open yet, but it can be assumed that players will be able to eventually order the game from CD Projekt's own GOG store in addition to a variety of other destinations.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_trailer_information">The Witcher remake trailer information</h2><p>As of yet, CD Projekt has not released any official trailers for The Witcher remake.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_platforms">The Witcher remake platforms</h2><p>CD Projekt has not announced any platforms for The Witcher remake, but PC seems to be a given, while it is expected the game will also come to console platforms.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_story__setting__and_characters">The Witcher remake story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Witcher remake is a new version of the game "rebuilt from the ground up." CD Projekt Red boss Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/us/en/news/46225/the-witcher-remake-is-in-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "going back to this place and remaking the game for the next generation of gamers to experience" feels "just as big, if not bigger" than when the studio first released the original game in 2007.</p><p>The game is based on Polish author Andrzej Sapkowski's novel series, taking place in a medieval fantasy world and telling the story of the monster-hunter Geralt of Rivia and his travels throughout a dangerous world filled with human and fantastical enemies alike. It's expected the remake will tell the same story.</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_game_engine">The Witcher remake game engine</h2><p>The Witcher remake is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, which is the newest version of the engine. CD Projekt has a deal in place with Epic to make more of its games using Unreal Engine 5 as well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">including The Witcher 4.</a> Previously, The Witcher series was developed using CD Projekt's own RedEngine.</p><h2 id="Who_s_developing_The_Witcher_remake_">Who's developing The Witcher remake?</h2><p>CD Projekt created The Witcher series, but the studio handed off development to Fool's Theory for the remake. CD Projekt boss Adam Badowski sung the studio's praises, saying the team knows the source material well and understand that fans have been looking forward to a remake for some time. A number of Fool's Theory staffers previously worked at CD Projekt on the original Witcher game. CD Projekt Red is providing "full creative supervision."</p><h2 id="The_Witcher_remake_development_news">The Witcher remake development news</h2><p>A key difference between the original Witcher and the remake is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-fully-open-world-unlike-the-original/1100-6509525/" data-ref-id="1100-6509525">the remake will be fully open-world</a>. Not only was the first Witcher game presented in a more linear fashion, the sequel, Assassins of Kings, was as well. These games featured large open zones players could explore. However, progressing the story past certain key points would move players to a new zone, closing off the previous area entirely. The series didn't go fully open world until 2015's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>According to Jakub Rokosz, who heads up the remake's developer, Fool's Theory, parts of The Witcher that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-remove-simply-bad-and-outdated-elements/1100-6520729/" data-ref-id="1100-6520729">outdated or are "simply bad" will be removed.</a></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/edge/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-witcher-remake-dev-pledges-to-remove-the-parts-that-are-simply-bad-and-i-think-i-know-whats-first-on-the-chopping-block/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Rokosz said that "first and foremost, we need an honest, down-to-earth analysis of which parts are simply bad, outdated, and need to be remade," but these changes will be done while "highlighting the parts that are great, should be retained, or are direct key pillars that can't be discarded" for the remake.</p><p>Some fans have already begun predicting which elements will be sent to the chopping block. Obvious changes include the dated combat and traversal systems, while online, fans are speculating that Geralt's infamous "Romance Cards" won't be included in the remake either.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/">imminent horizon</a>, Nintendo finds itself at a critical juncture. Every console launch is a pivotal moment for a company, but that's especially true for Nintendo. The first Switch proved to be a remarkable rebound from the disastrous Wii U, becoming one of the best-selling video game consoles in history over the last eight years.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, Nintendo is undoubtedly facing a lot of pressure to maintain this momentum with its next console. And while it's tempting to compare this transition with the move from Wii to Wii U, the company's current situation more closely resembles the position it was in as it prepared to launch the 3DS--itself the successor to a hugely successful and influential system.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, 14 years ago this week, Nintendo hosted a media event in New York detailing its launch plans for the 3DS. Though the company had publicly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gut-reactions-nintendo-3ds-e3-2010/1100-6266572/">unveiled the handheld a few months prior at E3 2010</a>, it withheld some key details--including the system's release date, price, and launch lineup--until this January event. In hindsight, however, the reveal offered a glimpse at a rough road ahead for the platform--missteps that Nintendo will want to avoid repeating when it finally launches the Switch 2.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Meager Launch Lineup</h3><p dir="ltr">The first indication of trouble could be gleaned from the system's launch lineup. Although Nintendo had announced some exciting titles for the 3DS at E3--including a remake of the beloved Ocarina of Time, new entries in the Animal Crossing and Mario Kart franchises, and a long-awaited Kid Icarus revival--none of these would be available on day one. In fact, most would not arrive until several months after the system launched.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Nintendo pushed the 3DS out to market alongside a handful of amusing but slight built-in applications like Face Raiders, as well as three minor titles: Nintendogs + Cats, Pilotwings Resort, and submarine sim Steel Diver. Without a marquee first-party release to accompany the system, it fell to third parties to fill in the gap. Their offerings, however, were not much more enticing, with a port of the years-old Street Fighter IV garnering the most attention.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, the handheld struggled to attract an audience right from the outset. As novel as the 3DS hardware itself was, the system hit the market without a true "must-have" game to convince players to upgrade, and many ended up waiting before finally purchasing one--a situation Nintendo will no doubt want to avoid repeating when it's finally ready to launch the Switch 2.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="316093893" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

By 2011, the final iteration of the Nintendo DS line, the DSi XL, was on the market for $170. Given the way Nintendo historically priced its handhelds, most industry watchers expected the 3DS to launch in the vicinity of $200. However, the final price would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-3ds-and-historical-handheld-pricing/1100-6286318/">much higher</a>. Nintendo surprised many when it announced the 3DS would retail for $250--$80 more than the DSi XL.</p><p dir="ltr">Without experiencing the 3DS in person, it was difficult for consumers to square the steep price tag. The system's defining feature--glasses-free stereoscopic 3D effects--could not be adequately conveyed to prospective buyers without getting the handheld into their hands and having them witness it for themselves (and even then, the feature’s novelty was arguably not as enticing as Nintendo hoped and would eventually be phased out in later iterations of the platform). Moreover, the early launch games, while a clear step up from the DS in terms of graphical fidelity, were not exactly visual showpieces for the handheld, making it difficult for Nintendo to justify the system's price to consumers.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Missing Features</h3><p dir="ltr">The final warning sign from the press event was the 3DS's features--or lack thereof. Although the system was poised to launch in March, its digital storefront, the Nintendo eShop, would not go live until June 2011: three full months later. Moreover, though Nintendo had touted the system's ability to play 3D movies back at E3, it had no further news to share about this feature during the January press event, which gave the impression the company was rushing the handheld out to market before it was ready.</p><p dir="ltr">Taken together, these three missteps set the 3DS on a rocky path, and the system limped out of the gate when it launched that March. Sales were so worrying that Nintendo took the unprecedented step of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-slashes-3ds-prices/1100-6325850/">slashing the system's price</a> by an eye-popping $80 USD in July, less than six months into its lifetime. (To further illustrate just how shocking this move was, the Nintendo Switch still has yet to receive an official price cut, nearly eight years into its life.) As a make-good to early adopters who did pony up the original asking price, the company also distributed an unexpectedly generous gift as part of an “<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-more-3ds-ambassador-games-named/1100-6331880/">Ambassador Program</a>”: 20 free NES and Game Boy Advance Virtual Console games.</p><p dir="ltr">This drastic course-correction had the intended effect, and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/price-cut-saves-3ds-4-million-sold-in-u-s-in-2011/">3DS sales rebounded</a>. By the time Nintendo stopped supporting the platform in 2019, the entire 3DS line had sold almost 76 million units--a respectable amount, but less than half of the 154 million units the original DS line moved. It's difficult to say whether or not the system would have sold much more over its lifetime had it had a smoother launch, but it's clear that early stumbles are difficult to correct, and most platforms never fully recover from a rocky start.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is undoubtedly aware of these pitfalls, having gone through many successful (and not so successful) hardware launches over its long history. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-will-keep-the-same-account-system-on-next-console-for-ease-of-use-apparently/1100-6515509/">repeatedly stressed</a> the need to ensure Switch owners can "smoothly transition" to the console's successor, citing the Nintendo Account system as an integral component of this strategy. Like the 3DS, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/">Switch 2 will also be backwards compatible</a> with its predecessor. Nintendo has already confirmed the new system will play original Switch games, guaranteeing it has a deep library right from the outset (especially with major Switch 1 titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> still on the way later this year).</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the similar circumstances it finds itself in, Nintendo is in a better position than it was when the 3DS launched. For one, every public statement indicates Nintendo will treat the Switch 2 as a continuation rather than a fresh start, as it has traditionally done when launching a new platform. To date, every system Nintendo has released has featured a distinct online service and storefront, which meant the company was continually starting from scratch each generation. The Wii stands as a prime example: Although it gradually built up an impressive selection of retro Virtual Console games over its lifetime, once the Wii U launched, Nintendo had to wipe the slate clean and release the games--at its typical glacial pace--all over again on the Wii U eShop.</p><p dir="ltr">That will not be the case moving forward thanks to Nintendo Switch Online, which Furukawa confirmed will also be available on Switch 2. Over the past seven years, the subscription service has amassed a vast collection of legacy games between its base and Expansion Pack tiers, so out of the gate Switch 2 users will have access to a wealth of classics--and a continued reason to subscribe to the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Time will tell how the Switch 2 will ultimately fare whenever it finally launches, but these are promising signs that Nintendo is taking the lessons of its past failures seriously and is doing its best to avoid repeating the mistakes that have hampered its previous consoles.</p>

                <p>Nearly nine years ago, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-more-new-switch-games-confirmed-after-nintend/1100-6457551/" data-ref-id="1100-6457551">Crashlands</a> introduced players to an alien space trucker named Flux Dabes as she survived a crash landing on the planet Woanope and crafted her way out of that jam. Flux's history will repeat itself this spring when Crashlands 2 arrives. In the new trailer below, Flux is literally dropped on to Woanope again as she is forced to make a new life for herself until she can get off-world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ib7fzLf59vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ib7fzLf59vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, Flux has to start over from scratch. That means if she wants a home, she'll have to build one herself. As before, Flux can craft her own objects and buildings, and she can also create weapons, traps, and any kind of gadget she needs to survive on Woaope. But on this world, Flux isn't necessarily on top of the food chain, and the alien creatures often hunt each other.</p><p>The announcement for the game also hints that Flux will uncover multiple mysteries on Woanope, and she'll be making some new friends to help her solve them. An ancient warrior named Grandmammy is among her new allies, in addition to Kleewik, an inventor who can employ Flux as a lab technician. Beyond mere escape, Flux's goal is to unite the various factions of Woanope, and "restore balance to the planet."</p><p>"Since the moment we launched the original Crashlands, we've been wanting to come back for round 2," Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster said in a statement. "But we wanted it to be bigger and better in every way, and it's taken many years to be able to pull that off. We can't wait to see newcomers experience the world of Woanope for the first time, and for players of the original to reconnect with Flux. So many people have told us that the original Crashlands was an important part of their childhood, and now we get to bring them a Crashlands 2 that's grown up as much as they have!"</p><p>Crashlands 2 will launch on PC, iOS, and Android on April 10, and players will be able to use cross-platform saves. The game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

                <p>It's officially 115 Day for Zombies fans, with January 15 being the yearly celebration of Call of Duty's Zombies mode. For this year's festivities, Treyarch has revealed the details for the next Zombies map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, and double XP is now live to celebrate 115 Day.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's new Zombies map is called The Tomb, which will launch with the start of Season 2 on January 28. This map's narrative follows the events of the Citadelle des Morts main quest, with the characters headed to an excavation site in search of the Sentinel Artifact. A first look at the map can be seen in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245" data-ratio="0.5375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428245"></a><figcaption>The Tomb DLC map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4428245-115_day_tout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says The Tomb was designed to provide an experience similar to Liberty Falls, featuring tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability. The developer also teases one of the season's new weapons by saying, "What if we told you one of the most iconic SMGs in Zombies history was coming along for the ride?" This could be hinting at the return of the MP-40 or PPSh-41 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate 115 Day, a quad feed of double XP is available in Black Ops 6 from now until January 21. This includes the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2X GobbleGum earn rate</li><li dir="ltr">2X Player XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Weapon XP</li><li dir="ltr">2X Battle Pass XP</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch included a preview of the quality-of-life upgrades planned for the Season 2 update. This includes a challenge-tracking feature similar to the one available in Modern Warfare 3, letting players track up to 10 challenges for camos and calling cards.</p><p dir="ltr">A new co-op pause feature is being added with Season 2. Currently, the pause feature is only available in solo games, but the update will include the option to pause when playing with friends. This feature requires all players to be in the same party, and the party leader will have the ability to pause the match for everyone.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have the ability to choose a separate HUD preset for Zombies and multiplayer, so they no longer need to switch HUDs between modes.</p><p dir="ltr">More information on The Tomb will arrive closer to the season's launch, but here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything we know so far about Season 2</a>, including the much-anticipated updates for the Ricochet anti-cheat.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/15/xbox-repair-reduce-waste-energy-saving/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> new options for support to repair your Xbox console. The first, for in-person repairs, will begin on January 20 with uBreakiFix by Asurion becoming an Xbox Authorized Service Provider at nearly 700 store locations across the US The second involves the Microsoft Store, with replacement components becoming available to purchase online as of today.</p><p>According to the blog post, these options include the Xbox Series S - 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X - 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X - 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition. Microsoft advises reaching out to your nearest <a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">uBreakiFix</a> by Asurion location and confirming participation in the program.</p><p>If you prefer to order parts online, the components are available via <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xbox-repair-parts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's online store</a>, as well as the Microsoft Repair Hub on <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/collaborations/microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iFixit</a>. Previously, the replacement components available for purchase were limited to controller parts.</p><p>In the blog post, Microsoft also details a correlation between these new repair options and the company's goal to become a "zero waste, carbon-negative, and water-positive company by 2030." In the meantime, it's aiming to eliminate single-use plastics from its packaging by 2025--hence why the Xbox Series X|S packaging is paper- and fiber-based.</p><p>Said goal has also had a smaller impact on the consoles themselves. According to Microsoft, it has improved how the Xbox Series S handles video, with average reduction approaching 10% in power consumption. The company also recommends using the Shutdown (energy saving) option, which can be found via Settings, General, and Power Options on your console.</p><p>The shutdown option has been available since September of last year, its addition paired alongside the announcement that the company's green initiatives have saved over 3 billion car miles of CO2 emissions. Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-green-initiatives-for-xbox-have-saved-over-3bn-car-miles-of-co2-emissions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push for AI technology</a>, however, is undermining said efforts. "We fundamentally believe that the answer is not to slow down the expansion of AI but to speed up the work needed to make it more environmentally friendly," Microsoft president Brad Smith told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-15/microsoft-s-ai-investment-imperils-climate-goal-as-emissions-jump-30?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>. "I guarantee there's one way to fail: It's to give up."</p>
