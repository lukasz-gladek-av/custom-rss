                <p>2K Sports has confirmed that WWE 2K24 will be delisted as of January 31, 2026, with servers shutting down on March 31, 2026. This information was disclosed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315690/WWE_2K24/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's Steam page</a>, but also applies to the console editions.</p><p>Once the servers go dark, "all game functions requiring online servers will no longer function."</p><p>2K Sports actually first <a href="https://support.wwe2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/47204260834323-WWE-2K24-Server-Sunset" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed the server shutdown on December 8</a>, but it wasn't widely reported on until more recently. The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.</p><p>All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.</p><p>WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years. The impending closure is a bummer for people who want to keep playing online, but this kind of thing is not uncommon in the world of sports games and beyond, for 2K and other publishers.</p><p>In September this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-shutting-down-servers-for-these-two-games-soon/1100-6534421/" data-ref-id="1100-6534421">2K shut off the online servers for The Golf Club 2019 and PGA Tour 2K21</a>. The newest WWE 2K game, WWE 2K25, was released in March 2025.</p>

                <p>If you find yourself with a shiny new Meta Quest headset during the holidays, be sure to check out the new Winter 2025 Edition of Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Create+Your+Own+VR+Games+Bundle+For+Less+Than+%243+Per+Game&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-22+07%3A28%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-22+11%3A30%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6537134&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-quest-vr-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-quest-vr-bundle%2F1100-6537134%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle</a> deal. Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. <strong>Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each.</strong> If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value.</p><p>As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design.</p><p>For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games.</p><p>The bundle also offers creative VR experiences like SuchArt and SculptrVR. The former has you whipping up colorful creations in your studio as you earn cash to upgrade your gear, while the latter lets you try your hand at sculpting (which, thanks to its innovative tools, is much easier than the real thing).</p><p>Plenty of other great games are eligible for the Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle, so be sure to check out the full list below. All of the VR games purchased in this bundle are delivered as official codes that can be redeemed via the Meta Quest launcher.</p><p>Along with the games, the deal includes a 5%-off coupon code usable on a future Fanatical purchase.

                <p dir="ltr">These past two months with Arc Raiders have been the most fun I've had with games all year. It represents the most exciting and unpredictable multiplayer landscape I've jumped into since Sea of Thieves in 2018, which I consider my favorite game ever made. It's safe to say I really love Arc Raiders. But it's become difficult to fully espouse those feelings as we learn about Embark Studio's use of generative AI.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the studio, Arc Raiders' voice acting was initially performed by humans, then used to "train" AI so that it could speak in the actors' voices while addressing any possible circumstance. For Embark, the team doesn't need to bring in the voice actors each time new content is added to the game. The AI voices learn to speak in the voices of the actors, which the actors are said to have agreed upon when they were hired, and the tools take it from there. Maybe it shouldn't have come as a surprise, since the team's previous game, The Finals, uses generative AI in a similar way. In an <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use" rel="nofollow ">interview</a>, Embark assured players that the game's visual artwork is entirely human-made, but admitted to using this text-to-speech training to bring voices to the game's shop NPCs, emotes, and other character barks. Knowing this has left me conflicted when I think to sing the game's praises.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">On one hand, I can't deny the hold Arc Raiders has taken over me. The heart wants what the heart wants, and Embark's extraction shooter, rich in emergent, player-driven drama, has lit my heart on fire in a way few games ever have. At the same time, I've already written <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arc-raiders-review-us-against-the-world/1900-6418435/">my review</a>. Though it was a glowing one that I don't regret, I also feel it's my job to call out this disappointing practice. In recent weeks, similar practices or plans have arisen in several high-profile examples. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/">Larian Studios' boss vouched</a> for it in some cases. Nexon's former CEO said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-nexon-ceo-says-aaa-games-are-in-end-of-days-and-ai-is-about-to-rewrite-everything/1100-6536651/">AI is about to rewrite everything</a> in the games industry. Ubisoft announced it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-using-an-ai-tool-for-writing-in-its-games/1100-6512552/">using an AI tool to help write its games</a> in some instances. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/">Hideo Kojima, often considered a unique voice in the industry, says he uses it at times</a>. It's being presented as not just helpful, but inevitable.</p><p dir="ltr">Is it, though? It seems that most of the people vouching for the technology are C-suite executives and studio higher-ups, who are obviously invested in it, emotionally and professionally, because it has the chance to cut down on the time and money a project demands. But so much of what generative AI does is also, to put it bluntly, a crock of shit.</p><p dir="ltr">We know by now that, when used as a search engine, generative AI is woefully problematic. It's not scrubbing the internet for facts. It's a sentence construction guessing machine, in which each word in a sentence or paragraph is based on what it expects the right sequence of words or sentences to be, based on a mass of data it rips from whatever sources its creators have fed it. This allows for some AI bots, like X's Grok, to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai/" rel="nofollow ">routinely express factually incorrect, sometimes even hateful rhetoric</a>. It was raised on the views of its CEO's exhausting edgelordism.</p><p dir="ltr">As a writing tool, generative AI is a legendary plagiarizer, remixing the mass of older books, articles, and other human-made works it's been fed and regurgitating them as pure, irredeemable slop, often sold for cheap on Amazon, where it <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DO6C14Tielx/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">preys on readers and gift-givers who don't have the internet literacy to recognize the mess they're buying</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">AI pictures and videos, meanwhile, are getting much more lifelike, which some say hurts the argument that we ought not use the tech. Others say they consult with AI-generated imagery merely as a jumping-off point, a brainstorming speedrun, where human artists take the kernels of ideas the AI creates and build on them from there. Executives, like Epic's Tim Sweeney, say generative AI will become so ubiquitous that efforts like Steam's labeling system used to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/"> disclose generative AI usage in games will quickly become pointless</a>. There's even some debate about just <a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/09/what-you-need-to-know-about-ai-and-climate-change/" rel="nofollow ">how problematic it may be for the environment</a>, which further muddies the ethical questions surrounding the tech. When, if ever, is it reasonable to use it? But I find all of these caveats and arguments ultimately fail to respond to the most significant consideration that will be forever tied to generative AI, no matter how reliable, clean, or unbiased it could someday become: Our humanity matters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596258"></a><figcaption>In this image: how it sometimes feels to oppose the rise of generative AI in games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4596258-arcraiders_16-9_13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Art is one of the greatest gifts we can give back to the world as human beings. The depth of our thinking and creating is unique to this world, possibly to this universe. I can't see a valid argument or excuse for the use case of generative AI that overcomes this truth. That's why Arc Raiders' use of it is so unfortunate. One of the best games of the year comes with this heavy asterisk beside it. Those voice actors deserved better, and their signing-away of their likenesses only hurts themselves and their peers, both currently and into the future. What seems true of this technology is that it tends to improve the more you train it. Because of that, using it is ethically questionable, and in some cases, such as the one in Arc Raiders, truly disheartening. Maybe Arc Raiders' AI voiceovers will get better with time, but that doesn't substitute for the fact that voice acting is a talent, an art form of its own, that deserves to be performed by people who bring authentic emotions to their roles, rather than bots that are faking it every step of the way.</p><p dir="ltr">What advocates for AI usage overlook is that the creation itself is a vital part of the project. This is what instills it with life and perspective. Generative AI can't be art because it's not made with a perspective; it's made with a prompt. Of all the counterarguments to using generative AI, I think this is the hardest to convey to people casually interested in the technology. The people who ask ChatGPT to conjure up a meme, write their cover letter, or answer their health-related questions may not be thinking about the cumulative human toll that using this tech takes. It's hard to quantify just why our humanity matters and how the use of generative AI harms it. It's sort of an abstract argument that must appeal to their hearts, first and foremost.</p><p dir="ltr">But there is also a practical argument, because the more we use generative AI, the more we are training it to replace us, as workers, as creators, as beings with a sense of belonging. As tech execs once again boat-race legislators on where the regulatory lines should be drawn, we are speeding toward a world where a highly exclusive few accumulate all the wealth, while working people are replaced industry by industry. There is an economic reckoning on the way, so any feeding of this beast becomes an architect of that dystopia. This issue stretches well beyond Arc Raiders and even well beyond games, of course. This is a problem that will worsen for everyone. It's hard for me to lose sight of that truth.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders proves how generative AI use doesn't necessarily ruin a game, but in its case, it hasn't really improved it either. It improves it from a workflow standpoint, some may say, but the finished artwork that is Arc Raiders doesn't seem to have been made better because of generative AI, so is it really worth the cost? As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-concept-artists-say-genai-isnt-making-things-easier/1100-6537107/">more developers speak out about obstacles being created by generative AI</a>, studios seem to be adopting it out of fear they'll be left behind, not realizing it's sometimes what slows others down.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this will be at the forefront of my on-the-job mind for the foreseeable future. I've done a lot of interviews here at GameSpot and expect to do many more. I'll ask developers I speak with how they plan to use this technology. I feel that we've reached an inflection point, a fork in the road. We can normalize this, accept it as inevitable, and let it further seep into games, TV, books, and other art forms we appreciate, or we can ask important questions. Why are you using this tech? What problems does it solve? What problems does it create? <em>Who benefits, and who is left behind?</em> Arc Raiders was a lightning rod for this topic here at the end of 2025. It's made my personal Game of the Year pick feel awkward and uncomfortable, but it's not the last of its kind. If executives can so thoughtlessly trade creative spirit for a percentage on their bottom line, I think it's extremely important that we challenge them to tell us why.</p>

                <p>The actor who provided the motion capture for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's Gustave has spoken out to say it would be "more logical" to have a Best Character category at awards shows to help give credit to everyone who contributed to bringing a character to life in a game. The actor, Maxence Cazorla, is saying this against the backdrop of only one person, voice actor Charlie Cox, being nominated for Best Performance at The Game Awards for the role of Gustave. For what it's worth, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-star-reacts-to-tga-nomination-says-he-doesnt-deserve-all-the-credit/1100-6536464/" data-ref-id="1100-6536464">Cox was open in acknowledging that Cazorla deserved credit, too</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">Cazorla said Cox was kind to say that.</a></p><p>Cox did not end up winning Best Performance, as it was Jennifer English as Maelle from Expedition 33 who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">took home the award</a>. In any event, Cazorla told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscurs-gustave-motion-performer-argues-game-awards-should-have-a-best-character-category-rather-than-isolating-a-single-performer-and-potentially-leaving-others-invisible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he believes a "Best Character category feels more logical" than "isolating a single performer and potentially leaving others invisible."</p><p>Whether or not this is something that host and organizer Geoff Keighley is considering for next year's The Game Awards is unknown.</p><p>Cazorla went on to say that it was an "incredible honor" for him that Cox "spoke publicly and acknowledged my work."</p><p>"I was deeply moved by his humility and generosity," he said.</p><p>Cazorla said a character like Gustave is a "combination of these two performances," referencing his physical contributions to the motion capture and Cox's voice. He also gave credit to the "incredible writing and development work" for Gustave.</p><p>While Cazorla said he would like to see a Best Character award in the future, he's not so sure about an award for the best performance capture. "I think it's a delicate subject, because every game is built differently," Cazorla said. "In this case, Clair Obscur is a game where many of the characters are created through collaboration between two actors."</p><p>Expedition 33's other major characters, including Maelle, Lune, and Verso were performed by multiple actors as well, Cazorla pointed out. "Other games might have a single actor doing full performance capture, and some projects even involve stunt performers, motion-capture actors, and voice actors all contributing to the same character," he said.</p><p>Given all that, Cazorla said he thinks the "fairest way to celebrate performers" is through an award, or some kind of recognition, that celebrates the character instead.</p><p>The DICE Awards already do this, Cazorla pointed out. "I think it's a very intelligent approach," he said. For the latest DICE Awards, the character Indiana Jones from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle won the award. He was performed by Troy Baker, for both his voice and the motion capture.</p><p>Expedition 33 just had one of its awards taken away, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">The Indie Game Awards revoked the title's Game of the Year win amid AI concerns.</a> GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">named Expedition 33 our Game of the Year. </a></p>
