                <p>BioWare is celebrating Dragon Age Day with a handful of surprises for fans centered around the recently released Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but also recognizes what's come before. A standalone version of Veilguard's character creator and a free armor set for the game inspired by Dragon Age II are both now available. Later today, the game will have a new update and you can see the full patch notes for Patch 4 below, which includes a new tool to take photos during the game's cutscenes, 20+ bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions. </p><p>Dragon Age Day was created by the game's fans to give Dragon Age its own version of N7 Day, the day that celebrates the community of BioWare's space epic series, Mass Effect. </p><p>The biggest gift to players is a standalone, free version of the game's character creator. For the folks who haven't taken the plunge into Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you can now create a Rook or Inquisitor, before buying the full game and transferring your character over. You just need to make sure you're on the same platform that you have the creator on.</p><p>There will also be the addition of Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke's armor, body paint, and nose blood smear as free cosmetics for your character. These cosmetics are a permanent addition to the game, and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing The Singing Blade mission.</p><p>Speaking of community, since Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out for over a month, developers will start an AMA over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Age subreddit</a> starting at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET today, December 4.. Previous AMAs were on its <a href="https://fortyseven-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2Xi6_oaezhq-pyYHW_g3OuOf1NGn6h6AvWUBtrSoR2cuq53uSkwFZEM8cqxaGSvHBtt966xQ835h7_ywaqJ3hI5vsIfUaruPEhsh5qYr7KoQ3mK8b_np2BmN78AI6f0tnhQBcySqfo5VuS_GJsKSsjYWNbJSJ4jTXAqQAe-CfWczpSIZkbdOmug" rel="nofollow ">BioWare Discord</a>, so if players want to check out the past questions and answers before hopping into today’s session, head over there.</p><h3>Patch 4 Notes: </h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that prevented some saves from loading properly. (PC Only)</li><li>Fixed an issue that was preventing the Frame Rate Limit setting from being saved.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Rook’s face and hair changing drastically when a save is loaded.</li><li>Fixed an issue with certain longer hairstyles that floated above Rook’s chest and shoulders.</li><li>Fixed an issue where two Neve characters could appear in the Fire and Ice quest.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue where Emmrich did not lead Rook to the next task in his recruitment Where the Dead Must Go quest.</li><li>Adjusted the spirit guides in The Warden Vault quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Ultimate Ability to swap to the default Ultimate.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Ultimate Ability Icon was not displayed after Bellara is recruited.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the first hit in a Warrior Rook’s shield throw may miss the target unintentionally.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Slaughter of Pillars Revenant had no health bar.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused Achievement Progress to reset when a new Rook was created.

He believes it's important for people to play where they want to play, whether it's Xbox Series X or mobile. That also may be why Xbox Year in Review breaks down playing time by where you played: console, PC, mobile, and cloud.</p><p dir="ltr">The Xbox Year in Review tool has become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-your-most-played-xbox-games-and-other-stats-for-2023-with-this-year-in-review-tool/1100-6519895/" data-ref-id="1100-6519895">an annual occurrence for the company</a>, and Sony and Nintendo are expected to provide similar summaries soon.

Stolz-Zwilling also explained that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is now in its final stretches of optimization, meaning that the the studio will finally show the PC and console specs for the game.</p><p>There will be performance and quality modes for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions, along with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">PS5 version being enhanced on the Pro console</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Big news: Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will arrive at your homes on FEBRUARY 4TH 2025!⚔️<br>With the release date pushing one week forward, we have a bunch of more exciting news coming in the following days. <br>Brand new Story trailer drops Tomorrow on December 5. <br>PC and Console… <a href="https://t.co/hfBrQZJyjS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/hfBrQZJyjS</a></p>  — Warhorse Studios (@WarhorseStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1864354217139314820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Stolz-Zwilling was coy about the decision the studio's decision to move the release date forward, only stating, "So you can start 2025 with the best game there is."</p><p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's original release date was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delayed-release-date-set-for-february-2025/1100-6525809/" data-ref-id="1100-6525809">February 11, which was announced after several delays</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a new Zombies map arriving in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on December 5, and Treyarch has released a short video to give players a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the French-inspired location. The video discusses the design choices and gives a better glimpse at the new Doppelghast enemy type.</p><p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France overrun with the undead. Treyarch says Zombies mode has plenty of maps "grounded in science fiction," and for this map, it wanted to lean more into magic. Citadelle des Morts also features elemental sword Wonder Weapons. This sounds similar to Black Ops 3's Der Eisendrache map, which was a snowy castle map with elemental bows. However, Treyarch says it has never featured a castle like Citadelle des Morts, as this new design lets players travel further into the claustrophobic bowels of the castle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKXep999Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WtKXep999Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also pulls back the curtain on the making of the Doppelghast, which is the map's unique special enemy. This creature has two heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms, and the developer says it wanted to design the enemy to be as unsettling as possible. The Doppelghast is also described as being "super fast and in your face," and the creature's hasty movement can be seen in the video above.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make it have a diverse attitude, where the two heads are constantly looking for something, but they have a separate mind," says Anthony Dicenzo, who is Treyarch's lead animator for Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows off more of the map's unique traps that are designed around the castle theme. This includes hot oil traps that can be lit on fire and magical runes that help protect players.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says players will have secrets to uncover within the castle when the map goes live. This will include the main storyline Easter egg quest, but if Citadelle des Morts is anything like the previous two maps, there will likely be plenty of side quests to discover as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">story trailer can be seen here</a>.

The digital version costs $60 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Steam, so Amazon's $40 price likely won't be available for long. Of course, there's a chance Amazon will cancel preorders placed at the $40 price.</p><p>Bleach Rebirth of Souls releases March 21, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X |S, and PC. Based on the popular anime, this latest entry in the Bleach series is a fast-paced 3D fighting game with swordfighting combat.</p><p>Developed by Tamsoft Corporation and published by Bandai Namco, Rebirth of Souls has local and online multiplayer as well as a single-player campaign designed for both veterans and series newcomers. The story is a retelling of the manga and anime from the beginning, so no prior knowledge of Bleach will be needed to follow along.</p>
