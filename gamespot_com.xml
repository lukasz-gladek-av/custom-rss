                <p>After several years of being a PlayStation console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is headed to Xbox Series X|S and Switch 2</a> in early 2026. Depending on how confident you feel, the game can be fairly challenging with its blend of real-time combat and action-RPG elements. But if you're looking to cruise through each battle and just focus on the story, then you can choose to play the game with the "Streamlined Progression" options enabled.</p><p>This makes Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade even easier than the old-school combat mode that slows the action to a crawl with menu-based commands, giving you an extended window to choose your tactics. Streamlined Progression gives you unlimited MP and HP at all times, unlimited limit and ATB gauges during battles, and every attack will deal a whopping 9,999 points of damage.</p><p>Additionally, you'll gain a faster weapon ability charge, and with some exceptions, you'll always possess the maximum number of items at all times. This mode can be toggled on and off at any given time from the main menu.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570949"></a><figcaption>Sephiroth won't be smiling for long.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4570949-ff7-remake-mode.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-mtg-preorder-bonuses-release-date/1100-6534723/">Square Enix has also revealed several of the preorder bonuses</a> for the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on new platforms.

As for the final chapter in the remake trilogy, producer Tetsuya Nomura recently said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-reveal-date-already-decided-says-nomura/1100-6534518/">Square Enix knows exactly when it will officially reveal</a> the game.</p><p>It'll still be a while before it arrives, but in the meantime, you can scratch your JRPG itch with upcoming games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dragon-quest-remakes-will-be-on-switch-2-at-launch-this-october/1100-6531824/">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-preorders-include-helpful-in-game-items/1100-6533621/">Octopath Traveler 0</a>.</p>
