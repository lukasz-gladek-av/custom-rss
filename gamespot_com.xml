                <p>Nintendo pulled back the curtain on its anticipated Switch successor, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, during its lengthy April Nintendo Direct presentation. In addition to giving fans a closer look at the hardware itself, Nintendo confirmed that Switch 1 owners will be able to transfer their system data over to the upcoming console.</p><p>According to the company, you can move your data from the original Switch to the Switch 2 by logging in to your Nintendo Account and using the System Transfer feature. This will transfer your game saves, digital titles, user profiles, screenshots you've taken, and other data (such as your settings and parental controls) to the new console.</p><p>As detailed on the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transfer guide</a> website, you will need to have an active internet connection to perform a system transfer. Once the transfer is complete, digital Switch 1 titles you own will be automatically redownloaded on Switch 2, allowing you to pick up where you left off on the new system.</p><p>In addition to being able to transfer your games over, select Switch 1 titles such as Super Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will receive <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates</a> on Switch 2. Nintendo will also release paid updates for some titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, adding new features and functionality to the games when played on Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 and retails for $450 USD. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders</a> for the system will begin on April 9.

The game features turn-based combat and a job system where players can mix and match different jobs and abilities to create unique party compositions. The game's title refers to its battle system, where Brave Points can be spent to increase the number of actions per turn. Alternatively, players can "Default" to stock up on actions and shore up their defenses.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time Bravely Default will be released on modern hardware, having originally released on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012. A sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bravely-second-end-layer/" data-ref-id="5000-222024">Bravely Second</a>, released for 3DS in 2016.

Deltarune has historically been released chapter by chapter, and this is the first time we've heard about Chapters 3 and 4.</p><p>Deltarune Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 will launch with the Switch 2. Even though they were announced during the Switch 2 Direct, Chapters 3 and 4 aren't exclusives for the new Switch. Deltarune Chapters 3 and 4 will also be available for the standard Switch, Steam, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDzgiGdekas" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yDzgiGdekas" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Deltarune, the turn-based RPG by Undertale creator Toby Fox, features a parallel universe similar to the world of Undertale. The main character Kris stars as the protagonist, surrounded by strong personalities like the bully-turned-friend Susie and mild-mannered mage, Ralsei. It launched on October 31, 2018 with a free demo of Chapter 1. Then, on September 17, 2021, Toby surprised us with Chapter 2.</p><p>"The world has been really tough for everybody recently. So I decided to release DELTARUNE Chapter 2 for free," reads the <a href="https://deltarune.com/update-092021/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deltarune September 2021 update</a>. Toby published the last Deltarune update about one year after that in September 2022.</p><p>Deltarune is an unfinished game, but fans have praised the storytelling and gameplay so far. Chapter 2 marked the discovery of an alternate route dubbed the "Snowgrave Route." Right now, it's unclear if there are more than two routes, but Chapter 3 and 4 are a great way to find out.</p><p>Deltarune will be available on June 5, 2025 as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release on Nintendo Switch 2 as one of many third-party games announced for the console.</p><p>As of writing, specific details are scant. There is no price point or release date for the game's Switch 2 port. In a short video segment, which was part of the April Nintendo Direct, Square Enix director Naoki Hamaguchi promised "more updates on the Final Fantasy VII Remake project for Switch 2." What exactly this statement means is unknown. Perhaps the sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, will also see a Switch 2 port. The aforementioned video segment showed off a couple early portions of the game, with principle characters Cloud and Barrett fighting robots. Other third-party games releasing on the Switch 2 include Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Sid Meier's Civilization VII, and Borderlands 4.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrXgnDfqP4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrXgnDfqP4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For anyone unaware, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-yuffie-episode-ps5-upgrade-detailed/1100-6488309/" data-ref-id="1100-6488309">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> originally released in 2021 as a PC port and PS5 upgrade for the erstwhile PS4 exclusive. It improved graphical features and added a mini-story featuring party member Yuffie. Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a partial remake of the classic game, covering the party's journey through the city of Midgar.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 news, the newest Mario Kart game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2-as-mario-kart-world/1100-6530411/" data-ref-id="1100-6530411">Mario Kart World is priced at $80</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">The console itself</a> will run for $450.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the ideas that Nintendo considered was "Super Nintendo Switch." Nintendo decided against this, however, because it "didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as the Super NES."</p><p>"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Dohta, meanwhile, added that the teams had "lots of back and forth" about what to call the Switch 2, but in the end, they came together and "agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">priced at $450 and scaling to $500</a> for a bundle that includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>.
