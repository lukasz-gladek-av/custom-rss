                <p>A newly announced TMNT game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown/" data-ref-id="5000-653831">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, will see Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello eschew their usual genre of sidescrolling beat-em-up for a new turn-based adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">TMNT: Tactical Takedown comes from developer Strange Scaffold, the minds behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator/" data-ref-id="5000-525368">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> and this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/i-am-your-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-631987">I Am Your Beast</a>. The developer promises a "bold new approach" to the TMNT universe, and not just because of the game's turn-based tactics gameplay, a first for the franchise. It's also due to the game's story, which will see the Turtles growing apart as they teeter on the edge of adulthood in a world where Master Splinter and their arch nemesis Shredder are both dead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwKmulVHmXI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WwKmulVHmXI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>, there will be 20 levels for players to battle through, divided into four campaigns focusing on different characters. Battle arenas will "grow, shrink, and add new threats each turn," with the game's visuals adopting a comic-book-style look combined with mini-figurines and dioramas. TMNT: Tactical Takedown will also sport a "multi-genre" soundtrack from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-paso-elsewhere/" data-ref-id="5000-532811">El Paso, Elsewhere</a> composer RJ Lake.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Turtle will have a customizable move set that looks to capitalize on their unique fighting styles while also allowing for clever use of the environment. Despite being turn-based, the game's debut trailer shows plenty of moving around, as the Turtles leap and bounce off enemies and reposition to set up their attacks for success.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for TMNT: Tactical Takedown just yet. It also looks like the game is currently only announced for PC, but that could change in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The TMNT have been busy in the world of video games recently. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-releases-june-16-including-game-pass/1100-6504336/" data-ref-id="1100-6504336">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a>, a return to the classic style of sidescrolling beat-'em-ups the heroes in a half shell are known for, released in the summer of 2022, followed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga/" data-ref-id="5000-560206">TMNT: The Cowabunga Collection</a>, a package of 13 old-school TMNT games, just a few months later. This year alone has seen the release of two TMNT games: The co-op roguelike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-splintered-fate/" data-ref-id="5000-588050">TMNT: Splintered Fate</a> and action-platformer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-601568">TMNT: Mutants Unleashed</a> (set in the same world as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tmnt-mutant-mayhem-review-the-pizza-crazed-teen-ninjas-pack-a-mighty-punch/1900-6418095/" data-ref-id="1900-6418095">well-received 2023 TMNT: Mutant Mayhem film</a>).</p>

                <p>While many consider Fortnite to be the pinnacle of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, was the first to bring mainstream attention to the format. Since then, Greene has formed his own studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, and today the team has announced a three-game plan for the future, which begins with Prologue: Go Wayback.</p><p dir="ltr">Prologue is described as a "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre," which will incorporate a new "machine-learning-driven terrain-generation technology" developed by the team. This new tech will allow the game to create "millions" of maps at once, though the specifics of how the tech works were not disclosed. Prologue: Go Wayback is set to launch in Steam Early Access in Q2 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvK-bQwd03g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The end goal of the three-game plan is Project Artemis, though little is known about what Greene and his team have planned. "My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time," Greene says, "and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up."</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Prologue and Project Artemis's announcement comes Preface: Undiscovered World, which is a tech demo intended to showcase Melba, PlayerUnknown Productions' new in-game development engine. Preface is in addition to the main three-game plan, and Greene says that the demo will generate an "Earth-sized planet" in real time, with players able to give feedback while exploring. Preface: Undiscovered World is available now for free on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Greene's previous project, PlayerUnknown's Battleground is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>
