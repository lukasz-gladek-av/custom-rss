                <p>GameScience has <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=149" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a new patch</a> for Black Myth: Wukong and it's a rather hefty one, featuring two challenge modes and loads of new equipment. There are some quality-of-life changes too.</p><p>The two challenge modes can be accessed after beating the game at least once. At any save point, called Keeper's Shrine, the player can find the "Return of Rivals" and "Gauntlet of Legends." The former lets players challenge any former opponents at three levels of varying difficulty.</p><p>The latter challenge mode lets players fight against multiple enemies in successions, with customized curses impacting the difficulty. Some old enemies will also have new moves. Completing the gauntlet will provide rewards such as new equipment, weapons, drinks, and medicine. In both modes, however, if any opponents haven't been defeated in the campaign, then they can't be challenged until doing so.</p><p>One of the game's criticisms is that it didn't provide a map while traversing. It now looks like there are purchasable maps called Journeyer's Charts. Whenever a player reaches a new territory, a corresponding Journeyer's Chart can be purchased at the Keeper's Shrine.</p><p>A new Armor Set of Opulence has been added to celebrate an early Chinese New Year, which includes four special armor pieces that can be claimed through "Trailblazer's Gift" at any Keeper's Shrine. Players can check out the Black Myth: Wukong Soundtrack Selection as a new soundtrack application as well.</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong is now out on PS5 and PC. It's also one of the nominees for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p><h2>Patch 1.0.12.16581</h2><h3><strong>What to Know Before Patch Installation</strong></h3><ul><li>Due to the platform's update mechanism, your computer will need to reserve a larger amount of free disk space for temporary storage of the update files.</li><li>If you have installed any mods in the game, installing the patch may cause compatibility issues.

It's one of the new secrets that's now discoverable in Night City after the recent launch of Update 2.2 for the action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Balatro account <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866815234410749984" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> teased the crossover, showcasing that the poker-inspired game's joker mascot--named Jimbo--appears as graffiti in Cyberpunk 2077 now. That led to CD Projekt Red global PR director Radek Grabowski revealing that the collaboration is official and part of a new in-game quest.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some time ago, I asked the Quest Design team at CDPR: "You liked the Cyberpunk cards in Balatro? What if we had Balatro cards in Cyberpunk 2077?"

                <p>Actor Rob Wiethoff famously portrayed John Marston in Rockstar's acclaimed 2010 Red Dead Redemption, and now he's starting a new project that is completely different and unexpected. Wiethoff, 48, has launched an OnlyFans, but it's not <em>that kind </em>of OnlyFans. After fans discovered he had an OnlyFans set up, Wietoff released a video responding to what he described as "panic" surrounding this.</p><p>"I have an OnlyFans page. I do," Wietoff told his 200,000 followers on Instagram in a video address. It costs $5/month to subscribe. Wiethoff's OnlyFans account will be focused on his own personal health journey as he looks to get lean and ripped.</p><p>"There will be nothing but me trying to get in shape. If you want to be part of that, you are welcome to join," he said. "I know what OnlyFans is. Not everything on there has to be that kind of content. That is not what my content is going to be. If you want to get ripped with an old-timer, sign up; that's it."</p><p>In addition to voicing John Marston in the original Red Dead, Wiethoff came back to play the character once again in Red Dead Redemption II, which is a prequel to the first game.</p><p>In other Red Dead news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-solid-pc-port-shows-how-red-dead-still-holds-up-in-2024/1100-6527663/" data-ref-id="1100-6527663">original game finally came to PC earlier this year with its Undead Nightmare expansion.</a> Rockstar Games is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, which is set for release in Fall 2025. However, reporter Jason Schreier said this week that he would be <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/gta-6-2025-release-date-delay-shocked-jason-schreier/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"shocked"</a> if the game isn't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">delayed to 2026.</a></p>
