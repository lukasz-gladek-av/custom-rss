<p>The voice primarily mentions delays and gate changes, but also includes a reference to Airplane and the aforementioned SpongeBob line:</p><p>"The driver of a white sedan--you left your lights on."</p><p>It's <em>slightly </em>tweaked from the famous "Band Geeks" episode to fit the official-sounding announcer's voice, but it's pretty clear that Iron Galaxy and Activision appreciate Patrick Star. Of course, the new Bikini Bottom area included in the game does this, as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAweH8Kh-VQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vAweH8Kh-VQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The line was originally uttered by Patrick in the episode after he was taken into a parking lot and beaten up to the point of getting shoved inside a trombone. There's nothing that grisly when you get injured in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, luckily.</p><p>For more on the game, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 review</a>, or read about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-returns-for-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-and-plays-two-characters-this-time/1100-6532730/" data-ref-id="1100-6532730">Jack Black's triumphant return to the franchise</a>.</p>

                <p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Blitz Royale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735">will be sticking around</a> past its previously announced expiration date, but it turns out that extension will bring some big changes, too. Like how, starting next week, the tiny Blitz island will be the new home of Mega City, that skyscraper-filled town that sat at the center of Fortnite's Battle Royale island for most of Chapter 4. Blitz Royale's first big update will happen on July 15. Mega City will reportedly take over the spot <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1942978180891189610" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">where Retail Row currently sits</a>.</p><p>So Epic isn't just extending Blitz Royale as is--instead, it's continuing as it has been with a new set of themed loot pools, with a continued focus on collaboration items, like this week's TMNT melee-fest. While the teaser refers to the collabs as a "surprise," <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942947410650575314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers believe</a> three of the weeks will center on Jujutsu Kaisen, Dragon Ball, and Mortal Kombat. Blitz will also clearly incorporate other weapons from standard Battle Royale as well, like the gloves that shoot birds that were introduced earlier this season.</p><p>Blitz Royale, with its focus on fast matchmaking and creating an experience that's palatable for mobile players, was immediately a hit when it launched in the middle of June, briefly serving as Fortnite's most popular mode. Player counts have fallen off somewhat since then, but Blitz still stands solidly in third place behind Battle Royale/Zero Build and Reload. And it's <em>well</em> ahead of the fourth place Fortnite OG. So it's no surprise at all that Epic would want to keep Blitz Royale going.</p><p>Before we dive into this updated version of Blitz, however--the new Superman skin, available on the current battle pass, will finally be earnable starting on Friday. Word is that he's bringing some other folks from the new Superman film to the item shop, like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1942949864268001521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mister Terrific and the Engineer</a>.</p>

                <p>As the games industry struggles to compete against other entertainment, as well as its own free-to-play sector, for people's time and money, games marketing analyst Chris Zukowski posits that developers' saving grace is Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent <a href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2025/06/03/most-people-who-buy-your-game-wont-play-it/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/valve-cracked-the-problem-that-netflix-was-struggling-with-using-diehard-gamers-and-their-backlogs-steam-expert-says-you-get-access-to-a-bunch-of-drunken-sailors-who-spend-money-irresponsibly/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>), Zukowski argues that Valve has cracked the problem that other entertainment services like Netflix have where success is measured by the time consumers are engaging with content. That is because gamers aren't just consumers, but collectors.</p><p dir="ltr">"The power of Steam as a platform is that it enables hoarding," he writes, comparing gaming with other hobbies--whether that is Lego, Warhammer, or knitting--that is made up a diehard audience that are "very interested in a subject and doesn’t worry about how much money they are spending on it."</p><p dir="ltr">Zukowski further digs into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-defends-30-steam-cut-in-antitrust-suit/1100-6494600/">Valve's 30% revenue cut</a> from Steam sales, which has attracted criticism. He however claims that the reason developers are willing to hand over such a high cut to Valve is because they're getting revenue whether or not their audience actually plays their game: "Knowing Steam players are hoarders explains why you give them that 30%: You get access to a bunch of drunken sailors who spend money irresponsibly."</p><p dir="ltr">Developers may take comfort in this analysis when competing against older live-service games like Fortnite and GTA Online that continue to be the biggest games, even if that means their revenue is coming from games that may never be played.</p><p dir="ltr">"Don’t be discouraged by that! This is totally normal for Steam," Zukowski continues. "If Steam shoppers were rational and only bought games they were going to play, we would sell a lot fewer games. Half this industry would be gone."</p><p dir="ltr">He does have a caveat for this theory, in that it applies more to games with a "very clear genre." "If players can look at your game in a glance and figure out the genre, they are more likely to impulse buy because they say, 'Ah, I love open world survival-crafting games! I know this! I am definitely going to play this once I am finished with the other 20 OWSC games in my collection.' If your genre is ambiguous, you won’t be picked up by hoarders."</p><p>If that's got you thinking of hoarding your collection, then the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/#2">Steam Summer Sale</a> is still currently on.</p>

                <p>At the end of last month, Funcom introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-dune-awakenings-huge-endgame-pve-changes-are-now-live-thanks-to-a-hotfix/1100-6532751/">some highly-requested endgame changes</a> that turned half of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening's</a> player vs. player Deep Desert zone into a player vs. environment area. However, earlier this week another patch was released that caused a number of areas in Deep Desert to switch back to PvP, resulting in a number of players losing out on bases, equipment, and vehicles. In response, Funcom has <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/developer-update/" rel="nofollow ">shared an apology letter</a>, explaining the steps it plans to take to make it up to players.</p><p dir="ltr">Talking about how this mistake took place, Funcom explained that this was an "oversight in our development process and internal communications" and was "intended to only occur with the next Coriolis cycle and not impact the ongoing cycle. We’re incredibly sorry that this happened and we want to acknowledge that this should have been handled better. We’ve changed our internal processes as a result of this and will be better in the future."</p>

<p dir="ltr">Funcom noted that it will be working to "reimburse vehicles and items (to the best of our ability) to players who were impacted by this," and that those affected can find reimbursed items in the in-game "Claim Rewards" tab by the end of the week.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also outlined some of its other goals for future updates, which includes removing "all identified exploits (third party cheat engines, client hacks, or in-game exploitation of game mechanics)," as well as adding in more quality of life features, and fixing numerous ongoing gameplay issues. It also noted how it's fixed things like account/permission spoofing, vehicle ownership takeover, durability repair, and building dismantle item duplication.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who have been affected by item and vehicle loss due to bugs, as opposed to the recent update, Funcom asked for your patience as it currently has a long backlog of customer support requests. It's aiming to deal with these as quickly as it can, including for closed tickets from players who weren't reimbursed properly when the developer wasn't able to around launch. Funcom also said the game has an entire team dedicated to mitigating vehicle and item loss on server crashes, disconnects, server mesh transfers, and travelling between maps.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about trying the game out for yourself despite its teething issues, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dune-awakening-review/1900-6418381/" data-ref-id="1900-6418381">Dune Awakening review</a>.</p>

                <p>GSC Game World has announced that Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl will be coming to PS5, ending its console exclusivity on Xbox. An release date has not been announced, but it will be out in late 2025, and you can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014084" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist</a> it now.</p><p dir="ltr">In a rather meta announcement trailer, rendered in-engine, soldiers are shown huddled around the colonel, who has his feet up while playing what appears to be Stalker 2 on the TV with a controller. It's eventually revealed that the controller resembles that of a PlayStation controller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2qFxNZksiSw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw">IGN</a>, the description adds that the PS5 version "will fully utilize DualSense controller features, including haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for deeper player immersion." It will also include "technical enhancements" for the PS5 Pro, although there are no further details.</p><p dir="ltr">While we await more information and its release date, you can watch our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gamespots-stalker-2-documentary-about-how-russian-war-impacted-the-studio/1100-6529929/" data-ref-id="1100-6529929">Stalker 2 documentary</a> about how developers were affected first-hand by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2 launched last November as an Xbox console exclusive, although leaked documents alleged that it was only going to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-only-has-three-month-exclusivity-on-stalker-2/1100-6490905/">timed exclusive for three months</a>. The longer wait could be related to the buggy state that the game launched in, with issues plaguing the post-apocalyptic shooter following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/">day-one patch</a>, while its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2s-first-major-patch-has-more-than-1800-bug-fixes/1100-6528561/">first major patch</a> fixed more than 1,800 bugs.</p><p>This follows other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/">first-party Xbox exclusives making the leap to other platforms</a>, when early last year Microsoft's Phil Spencer confirmed four first-party Xbox titles would be coming to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch. This has continued in 2025 with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> following its original launch last December, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> will release day-and-date on Xbox Series X/S, PS5 and PC in August.</p>
