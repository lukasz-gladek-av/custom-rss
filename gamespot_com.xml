                <p dir="ltr"><em>Shadow of the Colossus is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, October 18, 2025. Below, we examine the moral complexity of its narrative as told through its silent protagonist.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Does a silent protagonist equal a self-insert? The logic of many video games dictates yes. Heroes like Gordon Freeman and Link have been forever silent, only grunting or shouting. Even Master Chief, who does have a voice, obscures his face. Under his mask, there could be anyone there.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this common logic, silence is often alienating. Few games embody this better than the works of Fumido Ueda. The protagonists of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian are taciturn, often silent or speaking only a fantastical language, which is either subtitled or not immediately understood. Moments of speech, or even of action outside of player input, are profound and rare.</p><p dir="ltr">Under the logic of silent identification, these protagonists would be simple, iconographic player stand-ins. Yet Ueda's curated gaps create an empathetic distance from his games' heroes. Over the 20 years since Shadow of the Colossus' release, it has proven its profundity as a moral fable because of its distance from the player.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="221515360"

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">This is not to say that Shadow of the Colossus is uninterested in the video game form. Protagonist Wander's quest is grounded in games past. He seeks to rescue his love from death. To do so, he must slay the titular colossi: massive foes strewn across a forbidden land. The entity spurring Wander on, Dormin, is a voice from the heavens haloed in light. Wander wields a legendary sword--one whose connection with the sun guides him on his quest. In every superficial sense, he is the epitome of a hero. He has a noble quest, a holy tool, and monstrous foes meant for killing.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is the aggressor. For many of the colossi, he must fire his bow and arrow at them to even gain their attention. It is only when he intrudes on their space, and often not until he attacks them, that they will attack him. The colossi bleed black. It spurts from them as Wander stabs them. They moan, flail, weep, and scream as he climbs over and on them. Each colossus has an animal nobility, which Wander murders. Each element is a part of Shadow of the Colossus' rhetoric. Collectly, they change the usual aspects of heroic fantasy into something horrifying.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is not a cypher or a stand-in. Often, games with silent protagonists start from a position of relative normalcy. Think of Gordon Freeman's long train ride to the office in Half-Life, or Link's childhood stomping ground of Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time. In Shadow of the Colossus, we start midway through Wander's journey as he travels on horseback over the land. When he arrives and places his love Mono on an altar, we learn only a few things about him. One, he carries an "ancient sword," as Dormin calls it. Two, he is attempting to free his love from death and some curse. Three, his horse Agro is a loyal and courageous companion. There is the suggestion of a life lived outside the bounds of the games. There are things that matter that the player cannot yet see or know about.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Wander's exact motivations are shadowy. His relationship with Mono is never depicted. Instead we see how he acts without her. His journey to kill the colossi is strenuous and dangerous both, yet he continues with almost unfailing motivation. The player can direct him to stand over Mono's body on the altar. The camera zooms in, intimate in a way the game rarely is otherwise. Wander's love is profound, and perhaps selfish given how much he will destroy to see it restored, yet we do not witness it, and thus struggle to identify with it directly. Shadow of the Colossus builds this understanding through gestures that accumulate into cascading meaning.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these gestures, the game takes on a theatrical quality. The player inhabits Wander as an actor might play a role. The player makes some choices, like how often he visits Mono between besting colossi or whether their own skill will define him as a dexterous warrior or a clumsy, though strong-willed, commoner. Yet, the form is set. Wander has made his choices. The player can only interpret them.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a massive contrast with many other games, which are often concerned with the main character's morality. BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line, for example, use the main character as a player surrogate. BioShock's plot twist emphasizes how little agency the player actually has in the story, turning its hero into a hapless stooge. In Spec Ops: The Line, the player's will to finish the game and protagonist Walker's belief in the importance of his mission are equivocated. As Walker's determination damns him, it implicates the player too. In loading screens and monologues, Spec Ops admonishes the player to stop playing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935"></a><figcaption>Shadow of the Colossus (2018)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both these games have a little more under the hood than mere player condemnation, yet there is something shallow about their approach to protagonist morality. The developers themselves are curiously absent from this logic, for example. BioShock's twist has dramatic force, but little emotional heft. The protagonist isn't anyone; he is only a tool. The twist relies on player identification that comes only from absence. Spec Ops: The Line fairs better in this regard. Walker is a character of at least two dimensions. Yet, if he is a character who acts on his own terms, why all this discussion of player complicity? The moral swing cannot quite implicate the player in any real way.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow of the Colossus is also interested in agency, but not that of the player--, rather, of Wander himself. BioShock and Spec Ops are both loud. Antagonists Andrew Ryan and John Konrad explain tell the themes to the player in direct terms. Shadow of the Colossus is quiet. Its world is full of empty spaces and empty time. That emptiness leads to an empathetic, though still distant, stance. Through the process of play, the player comes to understand Wander. That process of embodiment is fuzzy, mythical, not simple or reducible. Shadow of the Colossus doesn’t treat the player as a hapless stooge, unable to really understand the situation at hand until the game’s writers offer their magnanimous help. Wander’s wrongdoing is not a twist. That fact allows the player to sit with it, even to embody it for a time.</p><p dir="ltr">Condemnation is cheap; it is understanding that is hard won and difficult. Though Walker has more voice lines and more writing, Wander still feels more real because his personhood is not attached to the player. Instead, there is a sense of an exchange. We feel for Wander and mourn for him. That relationship has a deeper and more profound bearing on our own morality than simple condemnation. If we ask whether we are guilty, Shadow of the Colossus will always be silent.</p><p dir="ltr">At the game's end, after a fellowship sworn to stop Wander arrives and seals him within the forbidden land, Wander goes where the player cannot follow. The sealing process has turned him into a child, which the successfully resurrected Mono seems to want to raise. All of Wander's heroics and strength have been sapped out of him. He is now a creature incapable of holding a controller.</p><p dir="ltr">That ambiguous end is part of what gives Shadow of the Colossus its lasting power. We were Wander's companions for a time. We walked with him. But his fate is his own. So too, is ours.</p>

Both of these are limited-time deals, though it's unclear when Amazon plans to end the price cuts.</p><div title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4721" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535524 - Asus Keyboard and Mouse Deal" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Logitech G Pro X Superlight Wireless Gaming Mouse</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible\/dp\/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-SUPERLIGHT-Ultra-Lightweight-Programmable-Compatible/dp/B087LXCTFJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$95 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Besides a few good discounts in February and March, this is the best price we've seen for the Logitech G Pro X Superlight this year.

Its PTFE feet also help it glide across most surfaces, and you shouldn't have to worry about any input lag thanks to Logitech's Lightspeed technology--which uses a USB receiver for rapid responses.</p><p>The wireless gaming mouse is compatible with both PC and Mac, though the deal is only available for the black model.

Both products are wired, and if you're playing an MMO or other game that could benefit from dozens of inputs, the G502 Hero Gaming Mouse and its 11 programmable buttons could be a good fit. It's also equipped with the Hero 25K Sensor like the G Pro X Superlight above, though its design is decidedly more aggressive and "gamer." As a bonus, its weight can be adjusted using five 3.6 gram weights.</p><p>The G413 SE Mechanical Gaming Keyboard is a full keyboard with F Keys and a numpad, so it's a nice fit for both gaming and working. Its aluminum top case should make it durable enough to hold up nicely over the years (or during rage-inducing key smashings), and its tactile mechanical switches are built to be highly responsive. It also benefits from 6-key rollover, LED lighting, and PBT keycaps.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Alongside these two Logitech deals, a bunch of Asus products are also discounted at Amazon right now. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCZQTF74?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Harpe Ace Aim Lab Wireless Mouse</a> for $70.49 (was $150) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-ROG-Three-Layer-Hot-Swappable-PBT/dp/B0CLF3WYGC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Azoth Wireless Mechanical 75% Keyboard</a> for $155 (was $275). The former is even lighter than the Logitech G Pro X Superlight at just 54 grams, while the latter is a 75% board with a unique OLED display that can show your system info, an audio visualizer, or simple animations. It's a stylish model equipped with swappable ROG NX mechanical switches, tons of RGB lights, and support for Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz connections.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3CX3QMD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Keris II Ace Wireless Gaming Mouse</a> is on sale for $100 (was $180), and with a 107-hour battery life, micro switches rated for 100 million clicks, and the reliable ROG AimPoint Pro 42K Optical Sensor, it's worth a closer look if you don't mind upping your budget. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Falchion-Hall-Effect-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DG7H487F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Falchion Ace HFX 65% Keyboard</a> is discounted, too, which could be a better choice if you're working with a small desktop or need to save space for sweeping mouse movements.

<section><p>Game Pass was the best deal in gaming. Now it's a deal in gaming, for some people.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Microsoft recently announced that Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is climbing from the sweaty price of $20 US per month <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">to an eye-watering $30</a>. The "real" gamers around the internet already have a joke for it: "Xbox 360 dollars per year."</p><p dir="ltr">But while the jokes write themselves, determining if Game Pass is still of value to me at this new price has taken far more energy. Yes, the company has also added new incentives and moved some features around, but do these additions create value, or just even more confusion? Let's break things down a bit.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate includes access to all Microsoft-published games--as well as many other titles--on their respective release days. It also includes a subscription to EA Play, Ubisoft Classics, and will soon include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Crew. With Ubisoft Classics coming in at $80 per year, EA Play at $40 per year, and Fortnite Crew at $144 per year, the total value of these subscriptions is $264, which definitely helps sweeten spending $360 a year on Game Pass--if you actually use them.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's talk about the subscriptions that come with Ultimate and what they mean. First, there's Ubisoft Classics. If you look at the Ubisoft Classics website, the standard subscription tier costs $7.99 per month, but only offers PC play. Ubisoft Classics' Premium tier, however, features both PC and Xbox play for a total of $17.99 per month. Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow ">claims that its version of Ubisoft Classics adds $7.99 per month</a> of value <em>per</em> platform, meaning those playing on both PC and Xbox receive the greatest benefit. With the Game Pass version of Ubisoft Classics, you get access to a rotating menu of games in their standard editions rather than the 100-plus games--often in their Premium editions--that are promised in Ubisoft Premium. You're getting access on PC and Xbox, yes, but to a smaller library of games, in Standard editions instead of Premium. Microsoft wants you to think of this as a $15.98 value each month, but with all these caveats, it's hard to take the quoted "$7.99 a month per platform" value seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">EA Play, meanwhile, is more straightforward. Through EA, the subscription costs $5.99 per month and offers 10-hour trials on new games and "unlimited access to a collection of top EA titles," and it seems as though that's what Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is offering as well.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in their standalone versions, both of these programs offer discounts on Ubisoft and EA games respectively; there's no word on whether those discounts would apply to Game Pass subscribers. We're guessing they won't, though, because as part of the price increase, Xbox also <a href="https://www.polygon.com/xbox-game-pass-perks-discounts-ended/" rel="nofollow ">eliminated the game and DLC discounts</a> that previously were included as part of the service.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite Crew is a bit more complex. If you stay subscribed to Fortnite Crew all year long, you gain access to all battle passes all year, and receive 1,000 V-Bucks per month (12,000 total in a year) and 12 sets of unique Fortnite Crew outfits. But while this might sound like a good deal, even if you play a lot of Fortnite, it still isn't worth the value. That's because not all the rewards you get for being a Crew member are created equal--Fortnite battle passes and Crew rewards are full of throwaway items you probably won't care about to fill out their offerings. These rewards mostly aren't the cool genre-bending collaborations like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-fortnitemares-2025-everything-to-know/1100-6535025/" data-ref-id="1100-6535025">Scooby-Doo</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">Power Rangers</a>, they're generic, non-copyright-infringing characters and songs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4587176"></a><figcaption>A promotional image from Fortnite's Scooby-Doo-filled Fortnitemares event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4587176-4582319-fortnitemares2025keyart.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'd have to love the Crew outfits, use the Jam Tracks, and play LEGO Fortnite modes--along with completing the Battle Passes--to really get your money's worth. The short version is that Fortnite Crew is $144 for about $100 worth of V-Bucks, some skins you probably won't use, some LEGO pieces you probably won't use, and Jam Tracks that you may or may not even care about.</p><p dir="ltr">Regular Fortnite players (myself included) will often buy a Crew Pass to complete a season's Battle Pass and earn the corresponding bonus V-Bucks. But as an ongoing subscription, you have to be <em>extremely</em> invested in Fortnite to justify Crew on its own merits.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, when speaking purely in terms of Microsoft-published games, Game Pass admittedly makes a pretty strong case for itself. This year alone has brought us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gears-of-war-reloaded-all-cog-tag-locations/2900-6885/" data-ref-id="2900-6885">Gears of War Reloaded</a>, and I'd be remiss not to mention that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a> are all just around the corner. This also doesn't include the various third-party games that come to Xbox Game Pass on Day One--games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. But again, the exact "value" here is subjective--you'd have to play a lot of those games for the math to actually add up.</p><p dir="ltr">Coincidentally, a study published by Circana shortly after the Game Pass price hike found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-of-us-gamers-buy-a-max-of-two-games-annually-analysts-say/1100-6535300/">most US game players purchase two or fewer new games a year</a>. Sure, there is a lot of nuance to this statistic, but at the same time, when the majority of gamers report they spend around $140 a year on new games, does the average player truly find value in spending $360 a year just to temporarily gain access to a handful of them?</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that we can't rely on Microsoft to release that many games next year or the year after. It might happen, but again, we're talking about <em>potential </em>value.</p><p dir="ltr">To get the greatest value out of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you'd almost have to use it to the exclusion of other gaming services, and that's not how the majority of gamers are using the service. Personally, I tend to like Microsoft-published games; by the end of the year I'll have played five of the above Microsoft-published games, along with a bunch of other third-party Game Pass games. I also play Fortnite <em>a lot</em> and tend to play games on my Xbox rather than my PlayStation. I'm one of the rare cases that can <em>maybe</em> justify that "Xbox $360" price tag. But even then, I hesitate.</p><p dir="ltr">In earlier days, Game Pass felt like a steal: You only had to play one or two games to justify the cost. Everything else was just gravy. With this price increase, though, the math becomes far more complex--to the point that it feels like you're talking yourself into giving your wallet to a guy who says he'll definitely bring it back and not to worry. And if that doesn't get you, the changes and transient nature of the service will.</p><p dir="ltr">Game Pass <em>was</em> the best deal in console gaming. Now, it's <em>a</em> deal in console gaming--but only under very specific circumstances.</p>
