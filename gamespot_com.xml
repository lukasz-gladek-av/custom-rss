These are likely references to cosmetics, as Call of Duty's online multiplayer is known for its raft of weed-themed DLC. It remains to be seen, however, if Black Ops 6's in-game purchases and operator bundles--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-never-guess-who-the-next-cod-operator-might-be/1100-6531191/" data-ref-id="1100-6531191">like the pot-themed Seth Rogen pack</a>--will carry forward to Black Ops 7 when it releases later this year.</p><p>The Call of Duty series has embraced marijuana for years, with all manner of weed-themed DLC. The legendary stoners <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-dlc-is-all-about-weed-turns-enemies-into-joints/1100-6522734/" data-ref-id="1100-6522734">Cheech and Chong came to Modern Warfare 3</a>, while that game had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">pot-smoking sloth bundle</a>, too. Black Ops 6, meanwhile, added a special <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-iconic-nuketown-map-gets-a-4-20-makeover-soon-in-black-ops-6/1100-6530460/" data-ref-id="1100-6530460">4/20-themed Nuketown map called Blazetown.</a></p><p>Beyond the weed stuff, the ESRB description for Black Ops 7 confirms an M rating for the game for its "blood and gore, intense violence, strong language, suggestive themes, and use of drugs." The description also states that the campaign story will involve players trying to "prevent a tech titan from gaining power."</p><p>"Battles are realistic and frenetic, highlighted by gunfire, cries of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Some levels allow players to engage in execution moves/sequences (e.g., repeatedly stabbing a foe in the chest, throat, torso). Some weapons cause characters to explode into bloody chunks of flesh," the description says.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, the two main co-developers of 2024's Black Ops 6. This is the first time Activision is releasing new Black Ops games in consecutive years. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">global reveal for Black Ops 7 will take place at Gamescom in August</a>, and this <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945137697418359215" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">could be followed by the Call of Duty Next event in September.</a></p><p>As for the competitor Battlefield series, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-when-battlefield-6-could-be-revealed-and-its-soon/1100-6533290/" data-ref-id="1100-6533290">EA and DICE will reveal Battlefield 6 on July 31.</a></p>

"Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the [Switch 2's] high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it, [but] there's just such a backlog for dev kits," Sinclair said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Sinclair added that "we definitely have plans" for Warframe on Switch 2, and it'll be a custom build of the online action-RPG. The game is playable on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Nintendo's new hybrid console thanks to backward compatibility</a>. While it originally launched in 2013, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-an-impressive-/1100-6463299/">Warframe came to Switch</a> in late 2018.</p><p dir="ltr">This follows a report from last week stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">the lack of Switch 2 dev kits is limiting third-party game announcements</a> for the system. Supposedly even bigger companies like Capcom and Sega are still waiting for more access to the devices, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Even after a decade, Warframe is still one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-games/2900-5406/">the 25 best free games to play</a>. Additionally, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-gaming-franchises-of-2024-according-to-fandom/2900-6075/#1">one of the top 10 gaming franchises last year</a>, according to GameSpot parent company Fandom. Digital Extremes is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soulframes-incredible-world-is-built-in-part-from-scottish-slang-and-ancient-bear-mythology/1100-6533287/">Soulframe, a free-to-play, open-world multiplayer RPG</a> with a fantasy setting.</p>

                <p>Decades ago, Atari games were some of the first titles to leap from arcades to home consoles. Now, a small selection of Atari's re-imagined classics are heading to AirConsole, an entertainment and gaming platform designed exclusively for cars.</p><p>AirConsole and Atari <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/airconsole-brings-legendary-atari-arcade-games-to-cars-302507956.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have announced</a> that Asteroids Recharged and Breakout Charged are now playable for the in-vehicle entertainment system that is currently available in supported Volkswagen models. To play the games, drivers need an active VW Connect Plus contract and an internet connection on a smartphone. However, the games will only work if the car is parked. Once players scan the accompanying QR codes, their phones become the controllers for the AirConsole titles.</p><p>"The AirConsole team has a phenomenal track record of optimizing the in-car controls and producing amazing playing experiences in vehicles," said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a statement. "We are excited for Volkswagen drivers and their passengers to discover these modern versions of our classic titles."</p><p>Atari will eventually add Missile Command: Recharged to its AirConsole lineup, but no other specific titles were mentioned by name. AirConsole is also working with carmakers Audi and BMW, but the Atari games are currently only available through Volkswagen cars.</p><p>Earlier this year, Atari announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">a new version of the 1984 arcade game I, Robot</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout Beyond</a>, an updated title that was originally intended to be released on Intellivision's Amico, a console that has yet to launch.</p>

Dressed to kill, this Operator is being released to promote the new entry in the horror film franchise. "Last summer, they know what you did. This summer, the Fisherman's in your lobby," the message reads for the brief teaser trailer.</p><p>While it doesn't have a number attached to it, I Know What You Did Last Summer is the fourth film in the slasher series, and it's a direct sequel to 1998's I Still Know What You Did Last Summer. Set 27 years after the Tower Bay murders, the movie features a new hook-wielding killer on the loose targeting a group of friends, one year after they covered up a car crash in which they may have killed someone. The movie premiered on July 18 to mixed reviews, and so far, it has scared up a worldwide box office gross of $24.6 million.</p><p>A release date for Fisherman--who bears a striking resemblance to the <a href="https://youtu.be/vgIY_U6Npxg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hash-Slinging Slasher</a> from SpongeBob SquarePants--has not been announced, but they are expected to debut in Season Five of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. This new reveal follows hot on the heels of several surprising crossovers in the game, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-american-dad-collab-is-real-shop-bundles-coming-soon/1100-6533245/" data-ref-id="1100-6533245">American Dad</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis &amp; Butt-Head</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">Eve Macarro from the John Wick spin-off Ballerina</a> have all been added in recent weeks.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-now-asking-players-to-verify-their-age/1100-6533243/" data-ref-id="1100-6533243">a new age-verification measure is being added</a>, and Treyarch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was recently announced with a slick trailer.</p>
