                <p>Amazon has revealed the next batch of free PC games that'll be available through its Prime Gaming service, and in November, subscribers can look forward to 24 games in total.</p><p>As a reminder, once you claim the free games from Prime Gaming, they are yours to keep forever--even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and score some great freebies.</p><p>Available right now, subscribers can add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-shot-through-the-heart/1900-6417764/" data-ref-id="1900-6417764">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-definitive-edition-review-an-offer-you-could-probably-refuse/1900-6417570/" data-ref-id="1900-6417570">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> to their game libraries. Guardians of the Galaxy isn't just a fun romp with a team of misfits; it's also one of the best-looking Marvel games currently available and tells a fantastic story along the way. Mafia: Definitive Edition is also a good-looking game, and while some of its gameplay can feel dated, it's still a fun open-world adventure that follows the rise and fall of the Salieri crime family during the 1930s.</p><p>Next week, the selection expands with several more games, like the steampunk walking-simulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/close-to-the-sun/" data-ref-id="5000-469228">Close to the Sun</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bang-bang-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-124178">Bang Bang Racing</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/duck-paradox/" data-ref-id="5000-568718">Duck Paradox</a>.

Just remember, your scientists were so preoccupied wondering if they could make a genetic abomination, they didn't ponder if they <em>should </em>have done it in the first place. On the Priem Gaming Luna channel, there'll be 15 games available to play in November.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for November 2024</h2><h3>November 1</h3><ul><li>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</li><li>Mafia: Definitive Edition</li></ul><h3>November 7</h3><ul><li>Dishonored: Definitive Edition</li><li>Duck Paradox</li><li>Close To The Sun</li><li>Disney Pixar Cars</li><li>Bang Bang Racing</li><li>Snakebird Complete</li></ul><h3>November 14</h3><ul><li>Ms. Holmes: The Case of the Dancing Men</li><li>Chasm: The Rift</li><li>House of Golf 2</li><li>Tomb Raider: Anniversary</li><li>Blade of Darkness</li></ul><h3>November 21</h3><ul><li>Max: The Curse of Brotherhood</li><li>Overcooked: Gourmet Edition</li><li>Gloomy Tales: One-Way Ticket</li><li>Super Meat Boy</li><li>Moonscars</li><li>RIOT: Civil Unrest</li></ul><h3>November 27</h3><ul><li>Elite Dangerous</li><li>Sir Whoopass: Immortal Death</li><li>Jurassic World Evolution</li><li>Mystery Case Files: The Dalimar Legacy</li><li>Shogun Showdown</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to the following games in November via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li>Amazon Luna Games</li><li>Jackbox Party Pack 7</li><li>Saints Row: The Third Remastered</li><li>Moving Out</li><li>Endling: Extinction is Forever</li><li>Infinite Minigolf</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>XDefiant</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Lego Fortnite</li><li>Rocket Racing</li><li>Fortnite Festival</li><li>Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li>Trackmania</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Flashbang grenades are meant to disorient your foes. Instead, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players have discovered that using them to blind your teammates will net you 15 XP. It's a farming trick that promotes bad cooperation.</p><p dir="ltr">YouTube streamer Expel posted a video of the XP exploit <a href="https://x.com/iamExpel/status/1851710616320295358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851710616320295358%7Ctwgr%5Ef633b41a8d558e587331c79028b5f75ddab84bb1%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fcall-of-duty-black-ops-6s-hottest-new-xp-farming-trick-has-players-flashbanging-their-allies-for-a-measly-15xp%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a>, adding that throwing flashbang grenades at allies "gives you XP" and "do with this information what you will." The UI text on screen states, "Flashed Enemy," so it seems likely this is an unintended benefit for being a terrible teammate.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/" data-ref-id="1100-6527292">progression and prestige is a core tenet of Black Ops 6</a>, on top of the rewards and unlockables in multiplayer. As such, there will always be players looking for easy ways to level up. For instance, the original Destiny famously had a loot cave for farming a decade ago, when people mindlessly shot at a cavern for hours on end. That exploit was addressed but ended up leading to an in-game dungeon acknowledging the loot cave. </p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 launched a week ago and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">saw a record-setting debut</a>. The new entry in the FPS franchise had the "biggest" three-day opening weekend for Call of Duty in regard to total players, hours played, and total matches. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-spiked-call-of-duty-to-a-bonkers-day-on-xbox/1100-6527515/" data-ref-id="1100-6527515">debut of Black Ops 6 also led to a "bonkers" day of engagement for Call of Duty HQ</a>--the app housing the game along with Warzone and Modern Warfare 3. Over half of all Xbox Series X|S owners checked out Call of Duty HQ on October 28, while over a third of all PS5 owners did the same.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-iconic-nuketown-map-arrives-to-black-op-6-this-week/1100-6527448/" data-ref-id="1100-6527448">iconic Nuketown multiplayer map arrives in Black Ops 6</a>. This is the original arena from Black Ops set in the 1950s, instead of a new variation.

                <p>The exact number of PlayStation 3 consoles that were ever produced has been revealed, according to a current Sony employee.</p><p>In what started as a discussion on Twitter about the PS3's infamous boomerang controller, a Sony programmer responded that they had walked past the controller in Sony's Japan headquarters recently and that it was located on the 16th floor near a coffee machine.</p><p>The employee took a picture of the boomerang controller in the display case, and on the shelf under it, there was a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/88-159-116-units-of-playstation-3-consoles-were-produced.1024860/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 console marked with the words</a>, "In memory of PS3 last production. Manufactured 88,159,116 pcs. Period: Oct 2006 - June 2016."</p><p>So there you have it. It seems like a little over 88 million PS3 consoles were ever manufactured over a period of almost 10 years. The last official sales figure for the <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/our-company/business-data-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 was around 87.4 million</a> consoles sold as of March 2017.</p><p>Last year, former Sony president Shawn Layden confirmed the exact number of <a href="https://x.com/ShawnLayden/status/1707563288178135099" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSP units manufactured</a>, showing a unit with the same phrasing as the PS3 one seen in the Sony employee's photo.</p><p>PS3 games can still be played today on modern hardware through PlayStation Plus, but only by streaming them. Users have been clamoring for some sort of native backwards compatibility with PS3 games. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-developing-ps3-emulation-for-select-titles-on-ps5-report/1100-6524478/" data-ref-id="1100-6524478">rumors floating around about emulation</a> on PS5, but it's unclear if it'll ever be delivered due to the PS3's unique architecture.</p>
