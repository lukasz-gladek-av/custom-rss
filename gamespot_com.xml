                <p>It might seem odd to suggest that a game filled to the brim with tough-as-nails twitch action games, thinky arcade puzzlers, and even a full-blown narrative RPG is not nostalgic, but UFO 50, a compilation of 50 retro-inspired games of varying sizes, is full of surprises. It has its influences, of course. Magical Garden pulls on Snake. Valtress is something of a cross between Kid Icarus and Downwell. It has a steady dedication to looking and sounding like games of the past. However, UFO 50 draws as much on 2000s era game jam culture as the NES itself. Rather than a mere evocation of retro titles, UFO 50 has a longing for creative constriction. Each individual game's simplicity serves a widening and deepening, a desire to pull as much as possible out of every pixel. UFO 50 creates the feeling of wide-openness, that video games can be anything. This is a feeling that has only thrived on the margins in video games and thus un-markable as a generalized nostalgia. When big business wants you to believe the new hotness represents all that video games can be, it is refreshing to look backward and forward at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To my mind, UFO 50's retro aesthetic serves two purposes. First, it keeps games resource-light. Each game is bare in construction, often lacking explicit tutorialization. Most games have a mere six buttons to play with. It maintains the mysterious workings and iterations of arcade games, without the quarter-munching business model. Each game can only be so big lest it outscope the rest. So, the focus is on mechanical density and complexity, on the kind of replayability that comes from careful design, not endless racks of content. The feeling is closer to setting up an emulator loaded with cult classics than to a childhood memory of getting an 8-bit console for Christmas.</p><p dir="ltr">Second, the retro vibes focus on each game's individual decisions and ideas. Some of UFO 50's games--like Campanella, its sequel, and The Big Bell Race--have obvious relationships to each other. Others--like the surreal Waldorf's Journey and the strategic Avianos--feel as if they come from different worlds. However, all of UFO 50's games feel as if they are made of the same component parts: pixels, code, a few buttons. Yet there is so much possibility. The simplicity draws out the span of what is possible. It makes each new trick feel remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413167"></a><figcaption>An example of the grid-based strategy game Avianos, where birds choose which Dinos to worship in order to gain strategic advantages.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413167-ufo50_ss14.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of UFO 50's most-striking games is Mooncat, a two-button platform puzzler. Most of the game, at least on the first run, is found in learning how it works. You control a two-legged creature, presumably the titular mooncat, which moves in combinations and timings between its two buttons. There's a jump, a ground pound, a little dash, and the basic movement left to right, but none of these moves are done in the conventional way; all prior knowledge of how video games are "supposed" to work vanishes. The art direction is whimsical and odd, but with no small amount of menace. Green fields populated by little critters turn into ancient tombs interlaced with gigantic skeletons and harsh deserts overseen by a red sky. It is the sort of game that is difficult to imagine being an actual commercial product, even in 1985. Its presence among more straightforward games showcases that UFO 50 is experimental. Sometimes its offerings will fit into genre conventions, but often they won't.</p><p dir="ltr">Fittingly, UFO 50's meta-narrative focuses on unearthing a forgotten catalog rather than revisiting classics. Its opening "cutscene" shows members of the UFO 50 team finding the game's fictional console in an old storage unit. This is not something enshrined in the annals of gaming history or the kind of thing you could (easily) discover at your local retro shop. It's overlooked. That's the reason the game opens on a storage unit rather than a mom-and-pop shop or a lovingly maintained collection (contrast this with retro collections like The Sega Master Collection, which features a main menu designed like a childhood bedroom). UFO 50's main menu focuses on the games themselves, showing cartridges. But they are not arranged on a shelf; instead, they are covered in cobwebs. Selecting a game you haven't yet played dusts it off. It's cutesy to be sure, but it conjures the archive more than the basement.</p><p dir="ltr">All this is to say, UFO 50 presents itself as an excavation rather than a return to the past. It wants you to discover, not to rediscover. There is no past to return to. Even in UFO 50's internal fiction, you are playing these games right now, not in some imaginary 1980s. The emphasis on discovery has a double effect: It helps these games feel alive and helps you approach them on their own merits, not just as mere echoes of the past. It is uncloying, dignified, but still playful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413169"></a><figcaption>A level from Campanella, showcasing a tiny UFO, some slime-like critters, and a little maze of obstacles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4413169-ufo50_ss01.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I've made a lot of UFO 50's reduction, but it is also excessive. It's 50 whole games! It would be possible to write at length about any of them individually. But its excess is found in the wealth of its experience, in the diversity it presents itself with. Most big-budget video games are large and excessive, but they tend to emphasize the same tasks over and over and all feed into some meta goal. While it would take over a hundred hours to completely finish every one of UFO 50's offerings, each game is also a complete experience in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">There's some melancholy to UFO 50's unique position. <a href="https://pastebin.com/538TpwCp" rel="nofollow ">Critic Liz Ryerson describes UFO 50</a> as "about a sort of lost innocence for games and what they could be before they became a massive dominant cultural industry." Now video games, or at least the business of video games, is a relatively narrow set of genres. Open worlds have codified into Ubisoft bloat. Live-service games chase the brand integration of Fortnite or the expansion of Genshin Impact. Call of Duty has been the dominant first-person shooter for well over a decade. Mainstream games have lost their experimental edge. UFO 50 is perhaps the biggest scale that an experimental game can operate in. That's still pretty small.</p><p dir="ltr">Nevertheless, UFO 50 is worth celebrating. I have often lamented the lack of Martin Scorceses in video games. I don't long for more crime dramas or invocations of Catholic dread, but rather I want more game developers that admire video games' past. I want more developers who gesture to history not out of empty, preening nostalgia, but rather out of respect for it, out of a genuine willingness to learn from it, and a desire, not to replace or improve the past, but to expand and deepen our relationship to it. UFO 50 is a small but confident and exciting step in that direction.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">This year, I decided I'd finally play 2022's Case of the Golden Idol, a mystery game that thrusts you onto the scene of a murder moments after it's happened. You pan through several screens, absorb every detail you possibly can, gather clues in the form of nouns and verbs, and make logic-based deductions by filling in the missing details in passages that tell the story of what occurred there. There are systems in place to guide you in the right direction, and the game begins quite simply, but by its end, I was being pushed to my absolute limit. The first few cases took all of about 10-25 minutes, but the final one in the game seemed to stretch across the span of an entire night. My head was positively bursting with possible motives and culprits, and kudos to Case of the Golden Idol for allowing me the room to be wrong about these cases until I eventually divined the right permutation of terms and cracked the case. It was one of the most frustrating ends of a game ever, and I was enamored of the whole experience.</p><p dir="ltr">I bring up Case of the Golden Idol and this frustration because, overwhelmingly, many of 2024's best games provided me with that very same feeling. These stellar titles, like Animal Well, Rise of the Golden Idol, and Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, are composed of what seems like countless of the most nefarious and confounding puzzles I've come across, some of which still vex and evade me to this day. And yet, despite that recurring headache--brought on by slamming my head into a proverbial wall over and over again--I wouldn't trade the experiences I had with them for anything.</p><p dir="ltr">I was wrong a lot in Rise of the Golden Idol, 2024's sequel to the aforementioned Case. I frequently confused names and aliases, and as the levels grew in scale (and the scenarios grew in complexity), I missed a lot of smaller details in the immaculately rendered environs that had been planted to provide insight and direction. I misunderstood the events of the game on numerous occasions, and was more surprised than usual at the revelations that were revealed by a level's end. Rise of the Golden Idol was thoroughly frustrating, and yet it's clearly one of the best games I've played all year because when I pushed it, it pushed back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418886"></a><figcaption>The Rise of the Golden Idol</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4418886-0007316561-ss_7c.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Rise of the Golden Idol's increasingly challenging cases urged me to think harder about the conclusions I was coming to. In my favorite of these cases, a man in an apartment complex is washing what appears to be a bloody stain from his shirt, leading me to believe that he was the epicenter of an inciting event that recently affected this community. Having taken the bait, I operated under the guise that I was correct until the game brutally rejected my conclusion and challenged me to make actual deductions rather than be shepherded to a point via obvious breadcrumb trails. It trusted me to figure things out.</span></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of my favorite games this year similarly refused to provide me with easy and obvious answers. I'm not entirely sure Animal Well has anything even remotely resembling a proper resolution. I mean, there's an ending to work towards, but the game also withholds so many more secrets that I may never see, and that's a thrilling and distinct relationship to have to a game when 100% completion guides are available online within days of a game's release. Animal Well is a mystery I suspect I will never get the satisfaction of fully solving. Instead, I get to fumble around in its dark caves for what seems like an eternity, prodding at its curiosities and objects of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is perhaps the most enigmatic of the bunch. Every door's contents is locked behind another puzzle. Televisions are hooked up to video game consoles that contain hidden directions and clues within their low-poly video games. Every line of dialogue is an esoteric headtrip. Walls are lined with posters that obscure patterns that are keys to boxes. Written notes contain ciphers, and there are otherworldly portals that take you to elaborately constructed mazes. Lorelei and the Laser Eyes is such a defiant game; it absolutely refuses to level with the player, opting instead to frequently demand that they rise to its level, a feat it is confident the player can achieve, in order to unlock its secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">I appreciate the room that these titles and others have given me this year because it feels increasingly rare. Games these days are often criticized for featuring too many tutorials or guideposts, and due to these trends, they can often feel reluctant to let go of the player's hand. Just this year, there have been countless conversations around yellow paint in level design, which is used to funnel players towards objectives and can be a blessing or a curse depending on who you ask. There's no right way to think about this design philosophy, but I do sincerely believe that the industry has erred on the side of hand holding a little too strongly, and it has flattened the experience of playing, or at least, the feelings that play can elicit. Of course, it's worth considering what mold of game I'm talking about when I suggest such a radical shift. Open-world games have a different responsibility to their players than puzzle games do, which could stand in the way of these developers bucking the trends I'm outlining. Still, the hope is that by speaking to the merits of the exemplary design in puzzle and mystery games, that more games of different genres might feel emboldened to pursue similar philosophies. I think it could work to brilliant effect, and in truth, it already has.</p><p dir="ltr">I always come back to The Legend of Zelda and its famously "hidden" bomb walls. The NES couldn't really afford the space for a different texture on these walls, making them appear like any other surface. However, they were in fact hidden across the game's world, incentivizing players to go out and discover them by any means necessary. Eventually, players discovered that by placing bombs at very select segments of walls, they could find hidden rooms and treasures. There's not a doubt in my mind that this was infuriating as all hell, but I also love that the game challenged players to be thoughtful, and in return it rewarded them with wonders beyond what they thought possible.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't believe that enough games--or at least a lot of the titles that take up the general mindshare and which often dominate the conversations we have about the medium-- are really challenging players all that much. That's what makes this trio of games, which all broke into the mainstream, feel like a breath of fresh air. As many titles shunt me from set piece to set piece, allowing very little in the way of exploration of experimentation, I've begun feeling like an observer more than a driving force in the games I play. The same can't be said about Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Animal Well, or Rise of the Golden Idol, games which made me feel like the best and most capable version of myself. Each of these games is distinct from the other. They occupy different genres and employ different styles, but they're united in their utter belief in the player. My hope is that games that follow, regardless of their genre, size, or developer, can take some cues from these remarkable titles and make strides to cultivate a sense of wonder and discovery again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
