                <p>Humble has revealed its March 2025 lineup of PC games for <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice subscribers</a>, giving members a really good selection of varied games to choose from this month. In March, you can explore the spooky Pacific Northwest, head to the stars for a cosmic adventure, and try a different take on the Monster Hunter formula.</p><p>Humble Choice is a $12 monthly subscription service that offers a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. You'll also unlock several other benefits, like exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice March 2025 Games</h2><ul><li>Pacific Drive</li><li>Homeworld 3</li><li>Wild Hearts</li><li>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</li><li>Gravity Circuit</li><li>Sir Whoopass</li><li>Racine</li><li>Cavern of Dreams</li></ul><p>One of the big highlights this month is Pacific Drive, a roguelite caRPG where you'll venture into the Olympic Exclusion Zone, a hub of science-defying activity. Strange stuff is going on in that area and you'll get to unravel the mystery of the game by roguelite runs in your station wagon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-pacific-drive-pulls-off-being-unnervingly-spooky-and-relaxingly-chill-all-at-once/1100-6523113/">If you enjoy exquisitely crafted spookiness</a>, then Pacific Drive will be right up your alley.</p><p>Another great game you can check out is Homeworld 3, a grand return to the sci-fi strategy series. While there were some teething issues on launch day, Homeworld 3 has received quite a few updates and post-launch content to help whip it into shape. Tales of Kenzera: Zau is another game that you'll want to download, as this is a 2.5D metroidvania action-adventure inspired by African folklore. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-bladedancing/1900-6418212/">Not just a fun game to play</a>, it also has a touching tale about loss and grief at its core.</p><p>Monster Hunter fans will also want to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts</a>. Developed by Dynasty Warriors studio Omega Force, the game combines Monster Hunter influences with a fast-paced crafting system, allowing you to build your way out of trouble when you face off against the fearsome beasts around you. It has a few rough edges, but it has fun combat, traversal, and building mechanics to help it stand out from other Monster Hunter-inspired games. The rest of the list includes several other interesting games, like Sir Whoopass and Racine.</p><p>As a reminder, all these games are available at no additional to Humble Choice members as part of their $12/month subscription. You can sign up now and gain immediate access to them all, and they're yours to download and keep forever. You'll also get all the other membership perks, including the Humble Vault and exclusive Humble Store discounts. As an additional goodwill bonus, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian organization Care.</p><h2>Humble Game Bundle Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fcapcom-arcade-classics-fighter-pack&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Capcom Classics and Fighters Pack</a> -- 70 items for $20</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdeckbuilder-bonanza&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckbuilder Bonanza</a> -- 6 items for $20</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Findie-allies-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indie Allies 2025</a> -- 10 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fbooks%2Fpathfinder-kingmaker-bundle-from-paizo-inc-books&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-great-monster-hunter-inspired-game-and-7-others-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529908%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pathfinder: Kingmaker Bundle</a> -- 52 items for $32</li></ul>
