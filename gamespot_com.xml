                <p dir="ltr">PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting March 4: <b>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</b>, <strong>Sonic Colors: Ultimate</strong>, and <strong>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-february-2025/1100-6529091/" data-ref-id="1100-6529091">February's PlayStation Plus free games</a> yet, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is the headliner here, as the game was released back in October 2024. BioWare's return to its single-player roots, The Veilguard earned mostly positive reviews <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-dragon-age-the-veilguard-coming-up-short-and-explains-what-happened/1100-6529252/" data-ref-id="1100-6529252">but sales did fail to meet EA's expectations</a>. For anyone looking to finally check it out, people have raved about the vibrant land of Thedas in this game, the colorful cast of characters, and satisfying combat mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">On the retro side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-colors-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-532379">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</a> is a great game for fans of Sega's Blue Blur. This is a remastered version of the 2010 game that was originally released for the Nintendo Wii, and it introduced a power-up system through the alien Wisp creatures that made gameplay very exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga/" data-ref-id="5000-560206">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</a> is a treasure trove of the classic TMNT games published by Konami in the '80s and '90s. It includes fan-favorite games such as Turtles in Time and Tournament Fighters, as well as the infamous NES game in case you want to relive the horrible underwater levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Each game has been updated with quality-of-life features such as save states, rewinding, and custom button layouts, and some of them feature local and online co-op play. There's even an entire digital museum of development art and concept sketches that you can unlock.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus Free Games for March 2025</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4450754-ps-plus-march-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450754" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4450754-ps-plus-march-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4450754"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Plus March 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4450754-ps-plus-march-2025.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em>Available March 4 - 31</em></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</li><li dir="ltr">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Sonic Colors: Ultimate</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">A couple of months after the unveiling, CD Projekt Red has decided to pull the curtains back to showcase how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4's</a> debut trailer came together in partnership with <a href="https://platige.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Platige Image</a>. The developer discusses that a major theme was showcasing how Ciri is somewhat of a mirror to a Stromford girl named Mioni.</p><p dir="ltr">The behind-the-scenes video for The Witcher 4 (seen below and posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on YouTube</a>) begins with director Sebastian Kalemba stating "that this is the moment to tell the story with Ciri." From there, the RPG's narrative director Philipp Weber opens up about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/">The Witcher 4's first trailer</a>--which debuted at The Game Awards in December--follows how two women approach destiny differently.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pGJ-B7v5tYI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We were thinking in the story that Mioni and Ciri are a little bit mirrors of each other," Weber said. "The traditions of Stromford essentially mean that Mioni has to be sacrificed. That's her destiny, and she accepted that destiny. Ciri is known as someone who does not accept destiny, she fights back at it."</p><p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red notes that the reveal trailer highlights this mirroring from the get-go, as Mioni gets dressed in a village tradition and Ciri prepares in a Witcher style. Additionally, the developer points out that Ciri does things differently than Geralt would do. Last month, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-voice-actor-is-excited-to-see-the-witcher-4-focus-on-ciri/1100-6528960/">expressed his excitement about The Witcher 4 focusing on Ciri</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of the mirroring theme, the behind-the-scenes video gives insight into the production of the RPG's debut trailer. For example, Platige Image says the motion-capture session lasted around 14 days, with another three days spent for on-site shooting and testing. There's discussion about the Slavic style being used artistically as well as the animation behind the Bauk monster.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time CD Projekt Red has elaborated on the trailer, either. After the unveiling in December, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-breaks-down-new-trailer-scene-by-scene/1100-6528474/">Kalemba broke down The Witcher 4 trailer</a> and confirmed the story within the video will be seen in-game. GameSpot also got a chance to chat with Kalemba <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-on-ciri-gwent-and-in-game-romance/1100-6528580/">about Ciri, Gwent, and in-game romance</a>. There is no release date yet for the game.</p>

<p>In total, there will be three new locations available in the open alpha:</p><ul><li><strong>Glacier (8v8v8)</strong> - This location is 20 times the size of any map from Splitgate and is full of icy slopes that allow players to chain speed from sliding with portal momentum</li><li><strong>Bypass (4v4)</strong> - A vertical map designed for high-flying plays, so you'll want to keep an eye on the sky</li><li><strong>Eden (4v4)</strong> - This map has plenty of portal-walls, as well as a launch-portal that can be used for daring aerial attacks</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">Cross-play</a> will also be supported, and some of the modes that'll be available to try out include Multi-Team Domination--where teams will battle to take control of four zones--and Multi-Team Hotzone, where players will battle it out to take control of a central zone.</p><p>For the new modes, 1047 Games will introduce Splitball and Firecracker to the game. Splitball is a two-team arena mode that combines classic Capture the Flag gameplay with the fast-paced strategy of Halo's Oddball, so teams will need to focus on offense and defense simultaneously. Search-and-Destroy game modes inspire Firecracker, and it involves an attacking team working to deploy the titular firecracker while the defending team attempts to stop them from setting off their fireworks.</p><p>1047 Games added that the open alpha will represent less than half of the content that will be present in Splitgate 2 when it launches later this year on PC and consoles. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

                <p>GOG has announced that it is adding FEAR to its preservation program next month after the game's developer, Monolith Productions, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shut down yesterday</a>. The version being added is the Platinum one, which includes the base game and both expansions. It's on sale right now on GOG for $1.</p><p>While FEAR was already planned to be added to the preservation program, GOG decided to accelerate the process. "Monolith Productions has given players some of the most unforgettable experiences, blending groundbreaking gameplay with rich storytelling," GOG said in a statement on <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>. "To honor their legacy, we’re proud to announce that F.E.A.R. Platinum will be joining the GOG Preservation Program."</p><p>There are two other games in the FEAR series, including FEAR 2 and FEAR 3. They haven't been announced as part of GOG's preservation program, but GOG said that other Monolith Production games will eventually join too.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">F.E.A.R. Platinum – featuring the base game and both expansions – will be available as part of the GOG Preservation Program by next month. Originally scheduled for a later timeframe, we’ve decided to accelerate this release to properly recognize Monolith’s contributions to… <a href="https://t.co/efu8872vx1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/efu8872vx1</a></p>  — GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1894753901540196781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 26, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This means that FEAR 2, as well as other franchises from the developer such as Condemned and Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor could be added. FEAR 3 was created by a different developer, Day 1 Studios, so it's unclear whether that entry will be included.</p><p>GOG's preservation program aims to maintain classic games for players by providing dedicated tech support to them even after their original developers stopped supporting them. Recent additions include the first two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dino-crisis-bundle-now-available-on-gog-with-enhancements/1100-6529092/" data-ref-id="1100-6529092">Dino Crisis games</a> and the original versions of the first three Resident Evil games. Unfortunately, some games aren't immune to being lost, as Blizzard requested GOG to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-delisted-on-gog-december-13-folllowing-blizzard-remasters/1100-6528156/" data-ref-id="1100-6528156">delist the original Warcraft 1 and 2 games</a> back in December.</p><p>Yesterday, Warner Bros Games shut down Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego, leading to the cancellation of Monolith's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-wonder-woman-legend-was-working-on-canceled-game-offers-heartfelt-tribute/1100-6529718/" data-ref-id="1100-6529718">high-profile Wonder Woman game.</a></p>

                <p>Sonic Rumble, the Fall Guys-inspired party game from Sega, was supposed to launch at the end of 2024. That didn't happen, of course, and the free-to-play game is now set for launch this spring.</p><p>In a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000111/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Sega thanked fans for their patience, saying the studio is "committed to delivering a memorable experience for Sonic fans." </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Em6-SjjaYQE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Em6-SjjaYQE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sonic Rumble was already available in a pre-launch early-access period with a limited set of features. For the global launch in Spring 2025, Sega will bring the game up to 1.2.0, and this will include a new competitive game mode and the "Crew" feature that allows players to get in on the action together.</p><p>A mode called Quick Rumble will also be there at launch. This offers "bite-sized" matches that only last one round. Sega said this is aimed at people who are short on time.</p><p>Whenever it's ready, Sonic Rumble will release on iOS and Android, as well as for PC via Steam. As for the console series, the latest release was 2024's Sonic X Shadows Generations. The next big release is Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, which launches later this year for console and PC.</p><p>Outside of games, the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-gets-march-2027-release-date/1100-6528922/" data-ref-id="1100-6528922">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set for releases in theaters in March 2027</a>. The movie series has been a big hit, banking more than $1 billion across its first three entries so far.</p>
