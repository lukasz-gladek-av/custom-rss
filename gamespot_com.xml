                <p dir="ltr">Leaks have been surfacing for months about a potential map for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> called Avalon. While nothing has been confirmed by Activision, players now believe the rumored map can be seen while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a large-scale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">map that leaked with some controversy</a>, as the design includes islands separated with lots of water, giving Caldera 2.0 vibes. Now, players are discovering that using Black Ops 6's spectator mode lets them see a rendered version of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are loading into private matches on Black Ops 6's Lowtown map and using the game's Codcaster setting, which lets them fly out of bounds and explore areas beyond the playable map. This reveals that Lowtown is part of a much larger Warzone-style map. Pieces of this map include older multiplayer maps from previous Black Ops games, such as Firing Range, WMD, and Hacienda. It also includes a view of the cluster of islands as revealed from the previous leaks of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" rel="nofollow ">reported by CharlieIntel</a>, a fan has even gone to the lengths to create a speculative overhead map with named points-of-interest.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The upcoming Warzone map, which is rumored for Fall 2025, can be seen in Black Ops 6's Theater Mode if you go into spectating. <br>Fans have speculated the different POIs based on the locations. <br>Image: u/Dull-Caterpillar3153 <a href="https://t.co/Vfu4YwPv8A" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Vfu4YwPv8A</a></p>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While it is very likely that this is the rumored Avalon map for Warzone, it's uncertain when or if this map will arrive in the game.

                <p>Google is celebrating Halloween with a brand new installment of Magic Cat Academy--marking the third edition of the Doodle. In the past, Momo the cat has taken on <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2016/" rel="nofollow "><u>ghouls in school</u></a> and taken a <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2020/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deep dive</a> to tackle sea monsters. This year, Google pits Momo against ghosts and space creatures as she battles her arch nemesis, Marshmallow the ghost, across the cosmos.</p><p>The rules of the game are simple: Draw the designated lines to defeat ghosts and other monsters across five stages. The lines and their sequence get more difficult as the game progresses, but you can always draw a heart to get more life, you just have to be quick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427" data-ratio="0.56288659793814" data-width="1455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png"></figure><p>After every level, there's a small scientific fact about the level of the atmosphere and something that the level focused on like stars or the flying fox bat. Google even included a gallery of concept art ranging from level design to dropped ideas like Momo and Marshmallow becoming a giant mech and teaming up. There's also a photo of the real-life Momo lounging around.</p><p>The game will run through October 31, 11:59 PM ET. You can also learn more about this Doodle, Momo's other adventures, and past Doodles <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Although Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones doesn't seem to have any pets during his globetrotting years, the third film--Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade--established that Indy once had a dog named Indiana that he loved very much. And Indy's love for dogs is one reason why he won't be shooting any enemy canines in Bethesda and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-much-nicer-to-its-dogs-than-wolfenstein" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, MachineGames Creative Director Jens Andersson confirmed that Indy's encounters with dogs owned by the bad guys won't end the same way they did in the developers' Wolfenstein games. Instead, Indy can scare off the dogs by pointing his weapon at them, rather than actually following through on the threat.</p><p>"[Indiana Jones] is a dog person," said Andersson. "This is obviously a little bit different than Wolfenstein as well, where the dog will explode... It's a family-friendly IP in many ways. How do we do that well? Well, these are the kind of things that we do. We have dogs as enemies, but you don't really hurt the dogs. You scare them away."</p><p>That's fortunate for the canines, but less so for Doctor Jones. As noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431"> early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the game favors stealth over all-out action. The enemy dogs may prove to be another challenge for Indy to remain undetected by Nazi soldiers. He may not shoot the dogs, but Indiana Jones has never had a problem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">punching a Nazi in the face</a>. As part of this game, Indy can also take out Nazis with stealth attacks and improvised weapons.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>
