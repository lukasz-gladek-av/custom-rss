                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a>'s Festival of the Lost 2024 is right around the corner. Arriving a bit later than usual, Halloween's celebration across the solar system promises some interesting surprises, from new masks to a slight rework of the event compared to previous years. If you're wondering what the armor ornaments look like, developer Bungie <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has shared details</a> about them, too.</p><p>Here's everything you can expect from Festival of the Lost 2024 in Destiny 2, including start times, masks, and the available rewards. We can't guarantee you'll be safe from jumpscares, though.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</a></li><li><a href="#Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</a></li><li><a href="#What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</a></li><li><a href="#Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_start_date">Festival of the Lost 2024 start date</h2><p>Festival of the Lost 2024 is kicking off after the weekly Destiny 2 reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on October 29. The event comes to an end with the weekly reset on November 12.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390894"></a><figcaption>Don't miss Destiny's annual Halloween party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390894-fotl_eva_compressed.jpg"></figure><p>It's a bit later compared to last year's edition, which started on October 17, but the scary vibes are the same.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024">How to start Festival of the Lost 2024</h2><p>Eva Levante will return to Festival of the Lost. As in previous years, you'll stumble upon her in the Tower. After a quick introductory quest and some candy delivery, you'll be all set to start earning rewards and wearing some cool masks.</p><h2 id="Do_you_still_need_Spectral_Pages_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_">Do you still need Spectral Pages in Festival of the Lost?</h2><p>If you were used to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-how-to-farm-spectral-pages-quickly-during-festival-of-the-lost/1100-6518479/" data-ref-id="1100-6518479">farming Spectral Pages</a>, well, that's in the past. Bungie has announced that players no longer need to collect the item to complete chapters of the Book of the Forgotten. You only need Manifested Pages.</p><p>Alongside chests in Haunted Sectors, Manifested Pages will drop from "many different sources while you're wearing a mask," said Bungie. We'll have to wait until the event kicks off to confirm what the developer is referring to, although it's safe to assume it might be related to other activities aside from Haunted Sectors, which will come in handy.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_masks_list">Festival of the Lost 2024 masks list</h2><p>It seems the celebrations around the release of Destiny 2 The Final Shape are still ongoing, as this year's Festival of the Lost is debuting seven new masks. Bungie also mentioned that masks found from Haunted Sectors will roll with higher stats, while the ones from Expert Haunted Sectors will have both high stats and "spikey rolls" with them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390893"></a><figcaption>Festival of the Lost 2024 masks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4390893-destiny2festivalofthelost2024guide.jpg"></figure><p>Below is the list of masks in Festival of the Lost 2024 (official names TBC):</p><ul><li>Cayde-6 Mask</li><li>Witness Mask</li><li>Tower Staff</li><li>Kadi 55-30 Mask</li><li>Thrall Mask</li><li>Runner Mask</li><li>Nezarec Mask</li><li>Ghost Mask</li></ul><h2 id="What_else_is_new_in_Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_">What else is new in Festival of the Lost 2024?</h2><p>Alongside the removal of Spectral Pages, there are a few tweaks and additions worth considering before diving into Festival of the Lost 2024.</p><p>Like in previous years, in order to earn Eerie Engrams, Haunted Sectors are your best bet. Keep in mind that you'll be able to grab more Eerie Engrams in Expert Haunted Sectors, as they know have a chance to drop an additional engram.</p><p>In the weapons department, you can expect a familiar lineup of Festival of the Lost guns, only with updated perk pools. Bungie doesn't want to share too many details, except for a few perk combinations as a tease:</p><ul><li><strong>Mechabre (Aggressive Arc Sniper Rifle):</strong> Lone Wolf in column 3, Closing Time in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Jurassic Green (Rapid-Fire Solar Pulse)</strong>: Loose Change in column 3, Incandescent in column 4, Search Party, Field Tested as origin traits.</li><li><strong>Braytech Werewolf (Precision Kinetic Auto Rifle)</strong>: Rewind Rounds in column 3, Onslaught in column 4, and Search Party as the origin trait.</li><li><strong>Acosmic (Rapid-Fire Void Grenade Launcher)</strong>: Withering Gaze in column 3, Bait and Switch in column 4, and Search Party, Nadie as the origin traits.</li></ul><p>Also, you're now able to buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva, basically avoiding the need to complete the Dual Destiny quest in Destiny 2. For this, you'll need to own The Final Shape expansion, but know that you won't be able to attune the class items you buy from Eva. Unless you complete Dual Destiny, you'll only get random rolls. But hey, luck might be on your side.</p><h2 id="Festival_of_the_Lost_2024_rewards">Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards</h2><p>Your candy-gathering efforts won't be for naught, as there'll be quite a few rewards to earn during Destiny 2's Halloween event.</p><p>Below are all of the Festival of the Lost 2024 rewards:</p><ul><li>Wizard Armor Ornaments for a scary vibe.</li><li>The return of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack shader</a>.</li><li>Arcane Embrace as a new weapon: The shotgun has Arc element and a Heavy Burst subtype, so it fires a hard-hitting, two-round burst while slightly reducing flinching from incoming fire while aiming. As teased by Bungie, a potential combo for the weapon is Fourth Times the Charm in column 3, Precision Instrument in column 4, and Search Party in origin trait.</li><li>Lost Memento is also returning as a reward, and you'll be able to hold up to three at a time. You can earn it from completing the Twilight Triumph or as a random drop from focusing any items.</li><li>You can also earn the new Spectral Carapace emblem for completing the Twilight Triumph.</li></ul><p>Have fun in this year's Festival of the Lost!</p>

This is the lowest price ever for the PlayStation 5 physical edition.

However, unlike the massive overhauls seen in those other remakes, this new version of Resident Evil 4 is a much more faithful adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">GameSpot's Resident Evil 4 review</a>, Kurt Indovina awarded the game a 10/10, saying that the remake "stands as a re-envisioning of its past rather than a replication of it. In doing this, it raises the bar for what a good remake is and at the same time, preserves Resident Evil 4's legacy as a genre-defining experience and one of the greatest games of all time."</p><p dir="ltr">It was the first of Capcom's Resident Evil remakes to receive a physical release for PS5, but soon it will have company. Capcom is releasing physical editions of the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1857463648388071813%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fresident-evil-4-remake-is-only-20-for-ps5-at-amazon-best-price-yet-for-physical-edition%2F1100-6521335%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 2</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1857463672667570343%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fresident-evil-4-remake-is-only-20-for-ps5-at-amazon-best-price-yet-for-physical-edition%2F1100-6521335%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 3</a> remakes on January 10, 2025. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1857463644962326822%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fresident-evil-4-remake-is-only-20-for-ps5-at-amazon-best-price-yet-for-physical-edition%2F1100-6521335%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 7 Gold Edition</a> will also receive a physical release the same day, so now its direct sequel, Resident Evil Village, won't feel lonely on your shelf.

The particular configuration sports Intel's new Core Ultra 7-155H CPU along with a GeForce RTX 4060 GPU, 16GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD, and crisp OLED screen, and you can pick it up for just $1,200 (down from $1,700) during Best Buy's sale.</p><p dir="ltr">While the laptop's specs can handle the latest AAA and indie games alike, the HP Omen Transcend's real draw is its 14-inch OLED screen. OLED screens offer better contrast ratios and more accurate black levels than LED panels. OLED laptop screen are uncommon--especially an OLED laptop for just $1,200.</p><p dir="ltr">The display also offers a 2.8K (2880x1800p) resolution and a high 120Hz refresh rate with VRR, which will make games look crisp and keep gameplay smooth--though, given the laptop's specs, you may have to fiddle with the in-game option to find the best settings. Along with the solid gaming performance, the screen sports flicker-free backlighting and low blue light output for less eye strain.</p><p dir="ltr">The rig's CPU is also of note. The Intel Core Ultra 7-155H is part of the brand's new line of premium mobile CPUs that launched earlier this year. This particular model is one of the higher-end chips in the line and offers strong performance and power efficiency, which means better-than-average battery life. In this case, the 14-inch HP Omen Transcend's battery lasts up to roughly 11 hours on a single charge and supports USB-C fast charging, which can restore up to 50% battery life in 30 minutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390888"></a><figcaption>14-Inch HP Omen Transcend Gaming Laptop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4390888-4390359-hp-omen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a bonus, the laptop also comes with three free months of PC Game Pass, which gives you access to tons of games, including almost every Microsoft-published title that's released in the last few years. That even includes day-one access to upcoming first-party games launching on PC, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preorder-guide/1100-6524003/" data-ref-id="1100-6524003">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/">Avowed</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preorder-guide/1100-6526575/" data-ref-id="1100-6526575">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">This HP Omen Transcend laptop is an excellent choice for those who prefer portable gaming rigs, especially at this lower price.

But if you're specifically interested in picking up a Call of Duty-themed controller, the most notable new release is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGY5KCYL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG's new Call of Duty Field Op Edition</a></strong> for PlayStation and PC.

If you're interested in the Pro BFG after reading this article, it's worth noting the standard colors of the Pro BFG, white and black, are available for even less right now. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9LDPXBF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original black edition is only $145</a>, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CRZ7KFKZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white is $155</a>.

With the included tool, you can quickly remove the faceplates covering the controls and shift the layout around. This allows you to have aligned analog sticks (PlayStation style) or offset (Xbox style). It also comes with four thumbstick caps, four stick grates, and three D-pad styles, including the solid square design shown above as well as more traditional eight- and four-way styles.</p><p>The right analog stick and face buttons can be swapped out for a six-button microswitch fight pad. Naturally, this won't be helpful for Call of Duty, but if you like fighting games, it's a great inclusion. It's worth noting Victrix also released a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Triggers-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0D7WYPB3V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tekken 8 Edition of the Pro BFG</a> in July.</p><p>The Pro BFG also has four built-in back triggers that can be remapped on the fly and trigger locks for R2 and L2 with five different stopping points. You can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>You can also remap inputs using the Victrix Control Hub on PC. You have more control over your experience with the app, but unfortunately it's only available for PC. That said, adjustments save to the controller, so as long as you have a PC, you can still take advantage of features such as tweaking stick and trigger sensitivity, setting up analog stick dead zones, and adjusting the sound profile. The Pro BFG has built-in audio that gives you in-depth control over your headset audio experience. Keep in mind you'll need to connect your headset to the 3.5mm jack on the bottom of the controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887" data-ratio="1" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390887"></a><figcaption>Victrix Pro BFG comes with hot-swappable components</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390887-victrixcustomization.jpg"></figure><p>The caveat to opting for a third-party PlayStation 5 controller is that you lose PlayStation's adaptive trigger and haptics tech as well as motion controls. If you're not okay with those losses, the only pro-style controller for you is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSense-Edge-Wireless-Controller-5/dp/B0BSYFB99D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation's DualSense Edge ($200)</a>. Some PS5 games make the DualSense's unique features a core component of the experience, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astro-Bot-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D5SM3K4Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot</a>--you definitely want to play the PS5's wonderful platformer with a DualSense controller.</p><p>The Pro BFG offers <em>substantially </em>better battery life than DualSense controllers, though. You can get close to 20 hours on a full charge in our experience. And if you want a PlayStation controller with the ergonomics of an Xbox controller, the Pro BFG is the best option.</p><p>It syncs wireless to your PS5, PS4, and PC with a 2.4GHz USB dongle. Alternatively, you use the lengthy, braided USB to USB-C cable for a hardwired connection. All of the Pro BFG's accessories have dedicated slots inside the included hardshell carrying case.</p><p>The Pro BFG is also available in white and black models for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC for $180</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> brings the return of Treyarch's traditional, round-based Zombies. There are two maps to choose from, with Liberty Falls being a more casual map and Terminus being a larger and more hardcore Zombies experience. No matter which map you choose, you'll want to make sure you're well-equipped. Here we explain everything you need to know when building a custom loadout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How custom loadouts work in BO6 Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Custom Zombies loadouts return. Just like in Black Ops Cold War, you'll load into matches with a weapon and equipment of your choosing. However, the loadout customization is a bit different than recent years.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll get one primary weapon slot. You can custom-build this gun with up to five attachments, assuming you have already leveled up the gun a bit and unlocked them.</p><p dir="ltr">Your loadout also comes with a dedicated melee slot. There are only two melee weapons in the game at launch. So, you can choose between a knife and a baseball bat.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can choose one piece of tactical equipment, lethal equipment, a Zombies field upgrade, and a pack of Gobblegums.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual guns you bring into the game won't be very powerful after the early rounds, and it costs a lot of points and salvage to level up that weapon's rarity and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-unlock-and-use-pack-a-punch-on-liberty-falls/1100-6527380/">Pack-a-Punch</a>. This is mostly a starter weapon, and thus the specific gun builds don't have to matter too much here.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be better off investing in Wall Buys with higher rarities, Mystery Box guns, or even Wonder Weapons like the Ray Gun.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Augments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390839"></a><figcaption>Zombies Augment Research</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390839-augmentresearch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Originally introduced in Black Ops Cold War, Augments are ways to make your field upgrades more powerful for your loadout, and they do the same for perks and ammo mods you purchase in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies matches get increasingly more difficult after round 25. The waves are more intense, and there are plenty of armored zombies that start to feel like bullet sponges. This is where Augments will become most beneficial. They'll give you added benefits such as extra health, increased movement speed, and immunity from fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll need to unlock Augments by completing Augment Research, which is a menu you won't have access to until you reach level 11. You'll want to <strong>make sure you start researching Augments as soon as you unlock the feature</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">There are 108 total Augments in the game, with multiple major and minor Augments available for every perk, ammo mod, and field upgrade in the game. You can only research one Augment at a time, and unlocking them is painfully slow.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Stamin-Up perk is a good starting point</strong>, as most of the powerful Augments are locked until you've researched a set amount of Augments. This includes the helpful Juggernog Augments that require you to research eight Augments before unlocking access to this research. Juggernog Augment research will be something you'll want to prioritize once you've unlocked it.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list and in-depth breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-all-perks-ammo-mods-field-upgrades-plus-how-to-use-augments/2900-5875/#18">all the Augments in the game can be found here</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Field Upgrade recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390840"></a><figcaption>All Zombies field upgrades</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390840-allfieldupgrades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At launch, Black Ops 6 includes the following field upgrades:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Aether Shroud: Phase into the Dark Aether, becoming hidden from enemy detection</li><li dir="ltr">Frenzied Guard: Repair armor and force all enemies in the area to target you. During this time, kills repair a portion of your armor</li><li dir="ltr">Healing Aura: Summons beams of energy down on yourself and allies to instantly revive and heal to full health</li><li dir="ltr">Energy Mine: Create a mine of pure energy that detonates in rapid succession, dealing lethal electric damage</li><li dir="ltr">Dark Flare: You generate a massive energy beam that deals lethal shadow damage. The beam penetrates everything in its path</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few really solid options here, depending on your playstyle and if you're playing with friends. It's usually good to have a mix of field upgrades for a full team.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: A medic role is important, so you probably want to have at least one player with <strong>Healing Aura</strong>, and <strong>Frenzied Guard</strong> is for the teammate who likes to be aggro and pull all the zombies towards them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aether Shroud</strong> is also a good choice for team play or solo matches, as going invisible for a short time can let you escape a sticky situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Flare</strong> isn't the most team-friendly perk, but it is a lot of fun to use and deal out a ton of damage. <strong>Energy Mine</strong> is the least helpful and enjoyable option, so this is a bottom-tier pick that I wouldn't invest much in.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Gobblegum recommendations</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390841"></a><figcaption>All Black Ops 6 Gobblegums</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390841-gobblegums.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Gobblegums return in Zombies, and these are powerful but temporary effects you can use. These are extremely optional. Some players prefer not to even use Gobblegums or things like Augments to make the game feel like a more classic Zombies experience.</p><p dir="ltr">However, here are some tips for making the most of your Gobblegums. Your loadout lets you customize a pack of five gums of various rarities, and you can earn more unique gums just by playing and completing rounds. You'll see an in-game popup every time you earn a new one.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd recommend grinding out some Zombies matches and saving up any powerful ones you earn for later matches, such as going for high-rounds or attempting an Easter egg.</p><p dir="ltr">These will be gums such as:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Perkaholic: Gives you all the perks on the map</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Up: Revives all downed teammates and lets them keep their perks</li><li dir="ltr">Wall Power: The next weapon you buy off the wall comes Pack-a-Punched</li><li dir="ltr">On The House: Spawns a random perk power-up that benefits you and your teammates</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, make sure to check out our Liberty Falls guides.

The Twitch campaign runs until November 13, with four items up for grabs, including a weapon blueprint. In order to get these drops, you will need to watch Twitch streams of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 where the creator has enabled drops.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 Twitch Rewards</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390713"></a><figcaption>It takes four hours to earn all four items from Twitch drops.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4390713-blopstwitchdrops.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are four items up for grabs: the XMG Get Wiped blueprint, Never Broken calling card, Azurite Vision charm, and the Deflected emblem. Most of these rewards are purely cosmetic, although the XMG blueprint can be used in-game, letting you access attachments for the weapon before you might have unlocked them by leveling up. Each of these items has a specific hour count you need to hit.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Deflected emblem - 1 Hour</li><li dir="ltr">Never Broken calling card - 2 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">Azurite Vision - 3 Hours</li><li dir="ltr">XMG Get Wiped blueprint - 4 Hours</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check your progress by navigating to your profile icon on Twitch and going down in the drop menu to <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/drops/inventory" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drops and Rewards</a>, which is also where you can claim these items once you earn them. Before you can start earning these drops, you need to make sure your Twitch account and Activision account have been linked. If your account isn't connected, there is a connect option in the Drops and Rewards screen under the Black Ops 6 campaign, which will take you to the Activision website, where you can log in and connect the two accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you have successfully connected your accounts, the connect link will no longer be on that page. From there, just head to the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> category on Twitch and look for the tag DropsEnabled to find a stream to watch. <strong>You will need to collect your rewards from the Drops and Rewards menu once you have met the time requirements.</strong></p><p>For more help with Black Ops 6, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/">Best Weapon Loadouts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-perks-and-wildcards/1100-6527396/">Best Perks</a> guides.</p>
