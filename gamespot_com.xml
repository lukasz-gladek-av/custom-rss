                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has a whole lot of quests, and one set of them requires you to do some digging on who has contaminated the water supply. This questline eventually leads to A Toxic Trail, which sends you back to a previous location to figure out more about what's going on with the water. In this guide, we'll tell you how to complete A Toxic Trail.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to extract from the map to complete A Toxic Trail, but it's not a bad idea to do so, especially if you don't have a safe pocket for the key that drops at the end of the quest. While it's not required for any quests, it can help you find some good loot on the Spaceport map later.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle A Toxic Trail, read on for each step you'll need to complete.</p><h2>How to complete A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step to completing A Toxic Trail in Arc Raiders is to head back to the drain where you previously found the barrel for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-source-of-the-contamination-quest-guide/1100-6535935/" data-ref-id="1100-6535935">Source of the Contamination</a> quest. This barrel can be found outside the Water Treatment Center on the Dam Battlegrounds map by approaching from the north via the swamp. Check the map below for the exact spot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624157"></a><figcaption>Water Treatment Control drain location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624157-share_20251216_0729350.jpeg"></figure><p>This time, you won't need to interact with the barrel. Instead, simply walk around in this nasty water for a moment to trigger the next step of the quest, which asks you to find traces of the barrel's origin. Luckily, you won't need to travel far at all to round up where the barrel came from.</p><p>Walk to the west just a bit to find a truck in the swamp water. It's hard to miss since it's sitting out in the open, but we've marked the location on the map for you below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158" data-ratio="0.5608755129959" data-width="2193" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624158"></a><figcaption>Find a truck submerged in the water here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624158-share_20251216_0729350-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Approach the truck and interact with the prompt that shows up to take a photo of it. Afterward, you'll receive a final task to search the trucks for clues about who sabotaged the water supply. Just interact with the door of the truck to find a Spaceport Warehouse Key. Pick it up and place it in your safe pocket, as it can come in handy for finding good loot next time you're in Spaceport.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624156"></a><figcaption>This truck is the source of the contamination.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624156-share_20251216_0729361.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that you're finished with the quest, you can extract at the nearby Central Swamp Lift. Just be mindful that this area can be easily camped by other raiders, so keep your wits about you. When you return to Speranza and turn this quest in, you'll receive a follow-up quest called The Stench of Corruption, which you'll need to complete if you want to earn the Warden outfit.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, take a look at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

                <p>Activision has made a couple of announcements that seem to suggest the company is trying extra hard to encourage people to buy and play Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p><p>For starters, Activision has launched a new week-long free trial for Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode. In the free trial, which runs December 16-22, players can access 20+ maps and try the Ashes of the Damned map for Zombies. In terms of modes, players can try out mainstays like Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Domination, and Kill Confirmed, as well as the Holiday Havoc mode and Prop Hunt.</p><p>Alongside this, Activision has discounted Black Ops 7 by up to 30%. This brings the price down to from $70 to $49 for the standard edition, or from $100 to $80 for the Vault Edition.</p><p>If you're playing on Xbox or PC, you can access Black Ops 7 with Xbox Game Pass or PC Game Pass. Microsoft <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Activision+Is+Trying+Really+Hard+To+Get+You+To+Play+Black+Ops+7+Right+Now&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-12-16+11%3A13%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-16+11%3A55%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6537022&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-is-trying-really-hard-to-get-you-to-play-black-ops-7-right-now%2F1100-6537022%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently brought back the $1 trial</a>, which means new subscribers can get Game Pass Ultimate for $1 for the first month.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched in November and reportedly had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">weak comparison to 2024's Black Ops 6 in terms of sales</a>. This could help explain why Activision is offering a discount on the game about a month after launch, though there could be other reasons as well.</p><p>In other news, Activision has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">no longer release Call of Duty games in the same sub-series, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in consecutive years.</a> While Black Ops 7's initial sales may have been lower, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call of Duty franchise remains the biggest franchise for Xbox Game Pass.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game in the US so far.</a> On December 17, we will find out from Circana how Black Ops 7 sold in the US, though the game's availability on Game Pass will put an asterisk on its sales performance.</p>

                <p>In January 2026, it will be seven and a half years since the announcement teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. In that time, Bethesda has had remarkably little to say about it or even a trailer to show off. Now, Bethesda's Todd Howard has indicated that most of the Bethesda team is working on The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>"It's progressing really well," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>. "The majority of the studio's on [Elder Scrolls 6]. but I'll say this: We always overlap. So, we're very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it's a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster--or a lot faster--but it's a process that we want to get right."</p><p>Although the initial announcement came years ago, it's possible or even likely that development didn't ramp up on The Elder Scrolls until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/" data-ref-id="5000-483376">Starfield</a> was released in 2023. Fans are so desperate for any kind of update that they're <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-think-a-skyrim-trailer-might-secretly-reveal-elder-scrolls-6s-release-year/1100-6536892/" data-ref-id="1100-6536892">reading things in the Skyrim Switch 2 announcement trailer</a> as if they're hidden hints about an Elder Scrolls 6 release window.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">recently as last month</a>, Howard said that The Elder Scrolls 6 is "still a long way off" and he expressed regret for announcing the sequel when he did. Earlier this year, Bethesda teamed up with Make-A-Wish for a charity auction to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-donate-to-make-a-wish-for-a-chance-to-design-an-elder-scrolls-6-character/1100-6529534/" data-ref-id="1100-6529534">design a creature in Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p>Howard also held open the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-tv-series-is-possible-says-todd-howard/1100-6536747/" data-ref-id="1100-6536747">an Elder Scrolls TV series</a>, much like the hit Fallout show on Prime Video. However, Howard indicated that he's "willing to say 'no' for a decade" rather than rush into that.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

Regardless of which color you choose for your headphones, the earbuds are always offered in black. Oddly enough, it's possible to buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM5</a> right now for $248 <em>without</em> the earbuds included. Be sure to select the bundle to get the earbuds for free. And if you only care about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-Bluetooth-Headphones-Resistance/dp/B0BYPFNW6T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">earbuds</a>, they're on sale for $90 (was $120).</p>                      </div><p>The Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones are extremely popular. While they're not the newest iteration of Sony's premium noise-canceling headphones (those are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM</a>6), they offer impressive noise cancellation. Sound quality is excellent as well, and it can be further customized using the companion Sony Sound Connect app. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and quick charging support that can restore three hours of playback in just three minutes of charging.</p><p>As for the WF-C700N earbuds, they may not be as popular as AirPods, but they're still a great option, offering IPX4 water resistance, multiple silicone earbud tips, a built-in microphone for hands-free calling, and the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>If you're shopping around for other headphone deals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> headphones are also on sale for $398 (was $460) ahead of the holidays. This matches the all-time low price from Black Friday, though it's still quite a bit more expensive than the older WH-1000XM5. Most shoppers will find the WH-1000XM5 bundle to be the best offer right now, but if you need the latest and greatest gear, it's nice to see the XM6 back down to the same price as they were in late November.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones are also quite cheap right now, with Amazon listing them for $180 (was $350). Offering up to 40 hours of battery life and a stylish design, they could be a nice alternative to the WH-1000XM5. Most colors are eligible for the discount, too, so it shouldn't be hard to snag something that fits your style.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
