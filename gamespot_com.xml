                <p dir="ltr">As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" rel="nofollow ">Wccftech</a>, Nvidia is reportedly on the verge of resuming production on its budget-friendly GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to combat the ongoing shortage of RAM being caused by an uptick in development on AI technologies and the increasing prices of memory.</p><p dir="ltr">Wccftech's reporting on these rumors seems to stem from a credible leaker of Nvidia GPU production news on Twitter called <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@hongxing2020</a>. According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲</p>  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days into 2026, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">reported</a> that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/" rel="nofollow ">preposterous</a>, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> popular graphics cards</a> around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4 Remake's</a> opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as "Chapter 0," in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Using leftover pieces from "Chapter 0" found in the game's files, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thekempy</a> has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra.</p><p dir="ltr">While the cutscenes for the cut chapter aren't found in the Resident Evil 4 remake's files, there are some leftover enemy spawn locations, scripted events triggers, auto-save locations, and even off-limit areas that help give an idea of what the chapter would have looked like.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear why this opening chapter, something that doesn't exist in the original Resident Evil 4, was cut prior to launch. Thekempy speculates Capcom's decision may have been related to pacing, as an opening chapter focusing on Ashley hiding and sneaking would have slowed down a game known for its non-stop action.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom is far from finished remaking Resident Evil games. Reports have indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">remakes of Resident Evil Zero and Code Veronica</a> may be coming in the next few years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-resident-evil-0-remake-will-flesh-out-originals-story-report/1100-6535568/" data-ref-id="1100-6535568">Resident Evil 0 remake reportedly looking to further flesh out</a> characters and plot details only alluded to in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, will bring back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leon-kennedy-is-back-in-resident-evil-requiem-and-now-he-has-a-chainsaw/1100-6536786/" data-ref-id="1100-6536786">Resident Evil 4's Leon S.

                <p>Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">41,816,052 users online at the same time</a> actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/steam-starts-in-2026-in-the-best-way-already-breaking-a-record-after-4-days,1544545/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost 13.4 million</a> as compared to March's 13.2 million record.</p><p>The timing of the record is likely no coincidence.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-7360/#g2a_2025_1694524" data-ref-id="2900-7360"> Steam's annual Winter Sale</a>, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.</p><p>Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-passes-28-million-concurrent-users-setting-new-record/1100-6499464/" data-ref-id="1100-6499464">28 million just a couple of years later</a>. The company even offered a bundle of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-covid-19-bundle-has-4-fantastic-indie-games-/1100-6475753/" data-ref-id="1100-6475753">which went to COVID relief at the time</a>. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">over 3 million concurrent players this week</a>.</p><p>While Steam reached this new peak after nearly 17 years of expansion, the pace of growth has been especially fast over the past six years, with peak user counts nearly doubling in that time. The achievement comes during a mixed period for Valve, which has faced criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">inconsistent content moderation and censorship decisions</a>.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see how these numbers change <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">once the Steam Machine comes into play</a> later this year.</p>

                <p>If you've been noticing that recent matches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> are ending in a lot more PvP skirmishes than usual, there's a high likelihood that you might've had it coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a> with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, confirmed that the popular extraction shooter has recently been employing a kind of "aggression-based matchmaking" to group up more like-minded players.</p><p>During an inquiry about the studio's approach to matchmaking, Söderlund said, "Since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE, and have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up."</p><p>The news seems to confirm what many players in the Arc Raiders community have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suspected</a> for a while now. In the last few weeks alone, there has been a steady increase in fervor around the notion of an aggression-based matchmaking system, especially as players found that they were running into more competitive lobbies. This is especially notable given the fact that much of the conversation around Arc Raiders at launch seemed to focus on how welcoming its playerbase was compared to the communities of other, more hostile extraction shooters, like Escape From Tarkov.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with PC Gamer</a> in December also yielded comments about "behavior-based matchmaking" which seemed to rile up players who felt justified in their theories.</p><p>Now though, it's all out in the open, though it isn't just as simple as matchmaking based on your kill count. As Söderlund is quick to clarify, there are several different levels of matchmaking going on at the same time in any Arc Raiders match. "First, it's skill-based, of course. Then, you have solos, duos, and trios, "Söderlund claimed. Then after that, Arc Raiders matches you based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.</p><p>The way Söderlund talks about it, it sounds like team always figured that as the game grew in size it'd need to deploy measures like this to more fairly group the differently segments of the game community.</p><p>At least this way, players who want to maintain the more cooperative ambiance of those early Arc Raiders days can maintain that for longer, while the bloodthirsty looters of the Rust Belt are free to pick each other clean in their own lobbies.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Rainbow Six Siege Defied An Industry</p>
      </div>
<p>Content creator VarsityGaming, who's been <a href="https://x.com/VarsityGamingTV/status/2007933363332731017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memeing the hack</a> since it happened on January 4, corroborated the 67-day ban on their social media, suggesting that Siege may be down for two more days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rainbow servers are still experiencing problems after 16 hours of the hacking incident happening, AGAIN.<br>Varsitygaming, the streamer who got the "67" day ban explains on the situation on how he can still matchmake even though he has supposedly been "banned".<br>At this point, it… <a href="https://t.co/9Ee0C396qX" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9Ee0C396qX</a></p>  — AllAboutGaming (@AllAbtGaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status page for Rainbow Six Siege</a> also underscores the unfortunate situation. At the time of this writing, every platform is experiencing "unplanned issues," impacting the game's connectivity, in-game store, and matchmaking. The website claims that some of these issues are being investigated, with the publisher thanking players for their patience during this weird time.</p><p>While 67 days seems like an absurd amount of time--and in the case of VarsityGaming, it was "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGPYamkcRA/#" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">67676767 days</a>"--the number is really a reference to the 6-7 meme. Originating in March 2025 in part by rapper Skrilla (and their December 2024 song "Doot Doot (6 7)") and point guard LaMelo Ball (who's six-feet-seven-inches tall), the two numbers together went viral on social media largely thanks to someone named Maverick Trevillian, who became known as the "67 Kid." An absurdist inside joke that has no emotional, political, or sexual connotation, 6-7 literally means nothing and is the epitome of brain rot. And because it means nothing, that's why it's so popular; it's just another way for kids to get under adults' skin.</p><p>This hack comes nearly two weeks after Rainbow Six Siege went down for two days after the Christmas holiday. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ep8ykky0ro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The BBC</a>, the game's servers were taken offline between December 27 and 28 following the marketplace being flooded with in-game currency that was reportedly worth millions of dollars. Ubisoft said at the time that "investigations and corrections" were going to be made over the next two weeks. It's unclear if this current hack is at all related to this previous hack.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege went through a major rebrand in the middle of last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-gets-most-transformative-update-ever-today-with-siege-x-launch/1100-6532322/" data-ref-id="1100-6532322">becoming Rainbow Six Siege X</a>. This transformation, which introduced tons of improvements and changes to the tactical shooter, brought in a huge swath of new and returning players, reaching 142,000 concurrents on Steam on June 10, 2025. That's not quite the all-time peak of 201,933 it achieved on May 17, 2024, but for a 10-year-old game, that's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>

                <p>A new controller from 8BitDo has been announced for smartphones, and this add-on will make your phone resemble a next-gen Game Boy. At CES 2026, 8BitDo showed off the FlipPad, a gamepad that connects to a smartphone via its USB-C port. Details on the FlipPad are scarce for now, but 8BitDo says it will support both iOS and Android devices.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/8BitDo/status/2007844470444933384" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Where mobile play unfolds.<br>Introducing 8BitDo FlipPad — a flip-style gamepad designed for mobile gaming.<br>Compatible with iOS and Android devices.

The controller has a classic D-pad on the left and 12 face buttons, including the traditional four-button layout found on modern controllers. This could make the FlipPad ideal for retro-inspired games and emulators, and 8BitDo says it'll reveal more details ahead of its Summer 2026 release.</p><p>This isn't the company's first dive into smartphone controllers; it currently sells the Xbox-licensed 8BitDdo Ultimate Mobile controller for Android and iOS. Similar to its Ultimate controllers for PC and console, these smartphone controller cradles are officially licensed and offer an impressive amount of features for their budget-friendly price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png"></figure><p>These have Hall Effect sticks, face buttons, a retro-style D-pad, and contoured tactile handles. As you'd expect, you can also customize them through 8BitDo's software, and they fit smartphones measuring 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length. You can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white Xbox model</a> for $46 or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Bluetooth-Joysticks-Officially-Smartphone/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black version</a> for its standard price of $50.</p><p>It can connect wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, so you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. As for battery life, 8BitDo claims the 300 mAh battery can deliver up to 13 hours on a full charge.</p>

RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strange Man YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OSQPMaU7yz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues.
