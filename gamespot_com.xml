                <p>EA's long-awaited Skate revival is launching this week in early access, but when exactly can you start playing? Developer Full Circle has now published the global launch times so you can hop in precisely when the servers go live on September 16 (or September 17 depending on where you live).</p><p>The original Skate came out in 2007, with sequels Skate 2 and Skate 3 arriving in 2009 and 2010, respectively. A mobile game, Skate It, launched in 2008. The franchise went dormant for more than a decade before EA announce a new Skate, simply called Skate, in 2020.</p><h2><strong>Skate global release times</strong></h2><p><strong>September 16</strong></p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>11 AM MDT</li><li>1 PM EDT</li><li>2 PM BRT</li><li>5 PM GMT</li><li>6 PM CET</li><li>8 PM TRT</li><li>10:30 PM IST</li></ul><p><strong>September 17</strong></p><ul><li>Midnight UTC+7</li><li>2 AM JST</li><li>4 AM AEDT</li><li>5 AM NZDT</li></ul><p>The new Skate is a free-to-play, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">always-online</a> game, supported by microtransactions. Because it's launching in early access, it's not the full experience or necessarily totally balanced. Full Circle said it will embrace fan feedback to shape the game going forward, and add things like new game modes, tricks, leaderboards, party voice chat, and other improvements over time.</p><p>One feature fans do not have to wait for is cross-play and cross-progression, as this is available from launch on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The game takes place in the fictional world of Sna Vansterdamn, which itself is made up of four unique neighborhoods. Full Circle said the world is "ever-evolving" and that players can expert new areas, challenges, and music to be added throughout early access.</p>

Skyhook will <a href="https://skyhookgames.com/open-letter-to-the-lawn-mowing-simulator-community/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">self-publish Lawn Mowing Simulator 2</a>, which means the developer itself takes all the risk--"which is scary"--but also gets "complete ownership of the project and control over the direction we take."</p><p>"We're sure that many of you will have a sense that the video games industry is in a tough spot right now, and you're not wrong. There are a lot of games being cancelled and jobs being lost--and in some ways that makes our decision to self-publish even more terrifying," the developer said.</p><p>Skyhook said it has "enough funding" to make Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 thanks to the success of the original game, but the company is also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skyhookgames/lawn-mowing-simulator-2?ref=3lfxcl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launching a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise money to help improve and expand existing plans.</p><h2>What's new in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2?</h2><p>Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 aims to offer an "expanded take on professional lawn care," featuring a new setting in the USA, more mowers and string trimmers to choose from, "new grass tech," a "total overhaul" for the career mode, and one of the most-requested features overall: leaf blowers.</p><p>"We know these have been wanted for a long time, and in LMS2 we plan to have leaf blowers as a part of the core game for clearing up leaves, as well as grass clippings," Skyhook said. "But leaf blowers wouldn't be much fun without a lot of leaves to blast! So in LMS2 we plan on having a system where tens of thousands of leaves can be blown around at once."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568107" data-ratio="0.56132756132756" data-width="693" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568107"></a><figcaption>The new grass in Lawn Mowing Simulator 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4568107-screenshot2025-09-15at10.19.46%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Lawn Mowing Simulator 2 is in development for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft is testing a new way to access Task View on Windows 11 with an Xbox controller. By long pressing the Xbox button on a PC, Task View will appear, allowing users to switch between say a game and Discord, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">This Xbox controller change is only available in preview builds on Windows 11, according to <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/09/12/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26220-6682-dev-channel/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft</a>. The tweak won't change other functionality with the Xbox button, such as a short press for the Game Bar and holding it to turn off the controller.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that the upcoming ROG Xbox Alley handhelds feature an Xbox button on the device and run Windows 11. That means accessing Task View should operate in the same way on those new devices, once Microsoft rolls out the change to the general public on PC, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Microsoft announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/">the ROG Xbox Alley handhelds will launch October 16</a>. The Xbox Alley device will be the cheaper option with a 720p display, while the Xbox Alley X features a 1080p display. However, exact pricing still isn't known for the portable devices. There have been previous reports of the base model starting at $550 and the premium system retailing for $900.
