                <p>The modding community can give older games a much-needed overhaul, or add an extra challenge to maybe an oversimplistic one. In recent years, we've seen everything from Resident Evil demakes to GTA upgrades--not to mention the vast landscape of Baldur's Gate 3 mods--but a new mod for 1991's Sonic the Hedgehog adjusts the game's visuals in real-time, going back and forth depending on the player's blast processing in the game.</p><p>Brandon Sheffield of Necrosoft Games showed how the mod worked on his <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky </a><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lgr543otmc2n" rel="nofollow">account</a> and did a quick demo.</p><p>"Vladikcomper on the SGDK Discord has created an amazing and ridiculous mod for Sonic the Hedgehog (MD) in which quality degrades to different resolutions/numbers of colors unless you fill your blast processing meter up," he said, as the game switched from widescreen to smaller size as the gameplay went on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434400"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434400-sonicdegrade2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434392,1300-4434393,1300-4434394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434392-sonicdegrade2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434393-sonicdegrade3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4434394-sonicdegrade.jpg"></figure><p>"Blast Processing" was the marketing term used by Sega of America to describe the processing capabilities of the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive that didn't really have any technological explanation, but sounded cool. With this mod, the player has a blast processing meter at the bottom of the right screen, which shows the processing power at that moment. If the player lets Sonic get hit or slow down, the game degrades from 16-bit graphics to almost Game Boy levels.</p><p>You can find this mod, and a slew of other Sonic-centric mods, <a href="https://forums.sonicretro.org/index.php?threads/sonic-1-blastless-dx-2025-update-widescreen-cga-mode.40149/#post-1091204" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The recent Sonic the Hedgehog 3 movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-3-just-did-an-extremely-rare-thing-at-the-box-office/1100-6528761/" data-ref-id="1100-6528761">was a huge holiday hit</a>, with a fourth installment to the franchise already in the works and aimed with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-speeding-your-way-for-2027-release/1100-6528577/" data-ref-id="1100-6528577">March 2027 release</a>.</p>

                <p>The first demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unforgiving-fantasy-extraction-shooter-dark-and-darker-has-its-steam-next-fest-playtest-extended/1100-6511474/" data-ref-id="1100-6511474">Dark and Darker</a> debuted almost two years ago, just a few months before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-and-darker-is-getting-a-mobile-version-from-the-creators-of-pubg-mobile/1100-6517182/" data-ref-id="1100-6517182">the mobile version of the game was announced</a>. Now, Dark and Darker Mobile's North American soft launch is just a few days away, and the global launch is expected to arrive in the first half of this year.</p><p>PUBG Mobile publisher Krafton and Bluehole Studio have revealed that Dark and Darker Mobile will be available for American and Canadian players on February 4. The soft launch was originally going to be only for Canada before the decision was made to expand the early access.</p><p>"We are thrilled to expand our soft launch beyond Canada and bring Dark and Darker Mobile to even more players across North America," said Bluehole Studio's Joonseok Ahn in a statement. "The strong enthusiasm from the community encouraged us to accelerate our plans, and we look forward to gathering more feedback as we prepare for the global release."</p><p>Like the original Dark and Darker, the mobile incarnation of the game thrusts players into a fantasy-inspired dungeon-crawler where they must contend with monsters and creatures while searching for loot and treasures. Players also compete against each other inside of the dungeons, with the victor taking the spoils. It's a high-risk/high-reward scenario that can leave one side bereft of everything that they had before entering a dungeon.</p><p>Although Krafton and Bluehole Studio haven't set a date for Dark and Darker Mobile's global rollout, pre-registration is currently taking place <a href="https://dndm.krafton.com/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on the game's official site</a>. Krafton has already laid out some of the other features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dark-and-darker-mobile-will-differ-from-the-original/1100-6522381/" data-ref-id="1100-6522381">that distinguish the mobile version from its PC counterpart</a>. For example, players can recruit AI sidekicks to accompany them into either PvE or PvP dungeons. Players can also equip several buffs to increase the odds of their characters' survival.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">First a hello, then sent to hell. That's the scenario the actor behind Grand Theft Auto V's Trevor would like to see for the character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. While Steve Ogg hasn't reportedly done any work on the next entry in the franchise, he'd love to see Trevor "pass the torch" to new leads in a way that sees his brains turning into pink goo.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://screenrant.com/gta-6-trevor-steven-ogg-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>, Ogg explained that his wish for GTA VI is "if Trevor appeared in it just to be killed at the beginning." This would be a full-circle moment for Trevor if Rockstar followed along with Ogg's suggestion. That's because Trevor kills GTA IV: The Lost and the Damned protagonist Johnny Klebitz in GTA V. "Pass the torch, stomp Trevor's head in, and sort of put an end to that and allow a new generation to take over," Ogg said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="186052573" data-promo-id="0"

              <section>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Kentucky Route Zero is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, January 28, 2025. Below, we look back at its inspirations and excitement for experimentation.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It is in the details that Kentucky Route Zero stakes its claim beyond video games. Its typewriter typography. The terse descriptions of characters between bursts of dialogue. The adventure game actions written like stage directions. Lights that illuminate the new parts of a stage or set. It is the details that matter. In practice, KRZ doesn't play differently from any other adventure game, but it feels different than many of them. This is because it takes from a wide array of influences, many beyond the usual preview of video games. Its interest in theater, film, visual art, and radio is what still makes it a vivid game five years later.</p><p dir="ltr">It is no secret that video games can be a little self-obsessed. While one could meaningfully label a painting, a movie, or a book as "science-fiction" or "romantic," video game genre designations like "roguelike" or "platformer" can only really describe video games (though if any one wants write an essay about what novels could be described as "strategy" or "simulation," I would be very eager to read it). Many--even most--big-budget games borrow from a ready-made list of influences, such as Star Wars, Alien, Indiana Jones, or Lord of the Rings. This narrow set of sources can make video games feel sometimes hyper-generic: unable to node themselves into a meaningful network, but instead digging deeper into an ever-drying well. When a big game attempts a big homage to genuine artistic legacy, it can feel absurd. Who could possibly take Ghost of Tsushima's "Kurosawa mode" seriously?</p><p dir="ltr">Though Kentucky Route Zero could be described as science-fiction, it is a quiet unnerving kind, drawing most obviously from the magical realism of writers like Gabriel García Márquez and Ricardo Piglia. It has stark artificiality, a stageness, that is clearly pulling on the theoretical and fictional work of Bertolt Brecht. It is, in a word, pretty far outside the regular span of video games. This results in something that can feel beguiling and strange in a way video games can often struggle to be, especially if you haven't read any of its inspirations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434372"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434372-krz3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>This is not to say that KRZ is ashamed of or above its adventure-games roots. It also stakes its claim within video games, sometimes in grand overt gestures. Within the first screen of KRZ you will encounter a computer console where you can request "games." It will reply "games is not real." In Act 3, you interface with a gigantic machine which plays a version of Colossal Cave Adventure. It is, undoubtedly, pretentious. But it also puts video game influences alongside the literary and theatrical without a lot of fuss. Of course these things belong together. Why wouldn't they? That matter-of-factness grants KRZ a lot of ground to explore its own formal qualities.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it is important that we not give into astonishment. Plenty of games take inspiration from outside of video games (or even just outside of video games' regular set of influences) and they are still tiresome. BioShock Infinite is perhaps the most grandiose and spectacular example of this. There are also plenty of great games which also pull beyond the medium's clichés. Disco Elysium and Signalis made big splashes for similar reasons. Norco was unfairly compared to Kentucky Route Zero for drawing on a different set of Americana. People can be hyperbolic about KRZ, naming it as one of the most important games of all time merely for having book smarts and pro-labor politics. It's easy and tempting to exaggerate a video game's originality or power, especially when we haven't read or watched or looked at the things it is drawing from.</p><p dir="ltr">But what KRZ has, that many other games don't, is a real excitement and verve for experimentation. It is not merely that it borrows from other works of art, but that it wants to innovate on its own terms. Each of its five acts are, to some degree, daring formal exercises. From the whirring wheels and road maps of Act I to the Huckleberryian ferry ride of Act IV, the game never settles on a consistent visual language or conceit. The game took so long to make, the full game released nine years after it first appeared on a Kickstarter campaign. This is perhaps explained by how eager it is to reinvent itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4434373"></a><figcaption>Kentucky Route Zero</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4434373-krz2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Every act, released individually, does feel like something new. Main characters vanish never to appear again and the player's control and perspective alter constantly. The culmination of this is, of course, Act V, where the player plays a cat wandering a small town. The camera turns on a swivel placed in the center of town. The center of the camera is on the spoke of the wheel or the trunk of a tree, the heart on which this whole community turns. In its final moments, the game takes on a communal character, not following any individual really, but instead a place: a people.</p><p dir="ltr">If you search the right phrase, you'll find dozens of forum posts asking for movies, books, and TV shows like KRZ. The question is sort of funny on its face. What makes KRZ strange and exciting in video games is far more commonplace in essentially every other medium. It is easy, and understandable, to denigrate KRZ's contributions for this reason. Could I not just read Gabriel García Márquez, Berholt Brecht, and John Steinbeck and call it a day? But what this fosters in me is a sense of indebtedness. Self-evidently, great art steals, but that theft is not one of ownership. It's more like a torrent. Every other copy still exists; many of them have their pieces in yours. It's a network. Any theft pulls a string, tying the knot further. KRZ's final image is of a house without walls--a place that lets you in--where new friends pull up a chair for you, and lend you a book. Kentucky Route Zero is a powerful work of art, because it is an invitation. Many games are eager to bring you into their world, to make it consume you. KRZ wants nothing more than to push you into something else, to make you see the world that came before it.</p>

Throughout this year, new features like an event system, base raids, weather events, the ability to teleport between servers, build sharing, and a new biome are all expected to come to Enshrouded. Following even more updates early next year, we can all expect Enshrouded's development to crescendo with a 1.0 launch next spring.

                <p>Dying Light developer Techland has ambitious plans for its zombie-apocalypse series, as the studio is looking to expand the franchise in the future.

Our goal is to bring the world of Dying Light to even more people," Techland said in a press statement.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1726303339" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Summer 2025</a>.

                <p>Microsoft is one of multiple companies looking to strike a deal to take ownership of the popular social media app TikTok, according to United States president Donald Trump. Asked on Monday aboard Air Force One if Microsoft was in the mix to make a deal, Trump told reporters, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-microsoft-trump-ban-china-0335cb0e4f394db3c0a6f06a064c5e64" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including the AP</a>, "I would say yes."</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-value-jumped-by-77-billion-after-announ/1100-6480732/" data-ref-id="1100-6480732">Microsoft officially announced plans to buy TikTok</a>, which sent the company's share price surging. Microsoft later <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/09/13/microsoft-statement-on-tiktok/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">abandoned</a> its buyout attempt, with CEO Satya Nadella saying the deal was the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-ceo-says-failed-tiktok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-worked-on-2021-09-28/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"strangest thing I've ever worked on."</a> Now, Microsoft may be back at the negotiating table.</p><p>Trump said other companies are in the mix to buy TikTok as well, but he didn't name them outright. It was previously reported that Activision founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980?AID=11557093&amp;PID=5835937&amp;SID=01HW8CZB4VGN2YZN49J1WFXY5Q&amp;subid=digidip&amp;cjevent=c4115b2d025211ef810600720a82b824&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=digidip&amp;tier_4=3743973&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fwhy-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bobby Kotick was assembling an investment group to buy TikTok</a>. The AI company Perplexity has also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discussed a potential deal</a> that would give the US government a 50% ownership stake in TikTok.</p><p>"I like bidding wars because you make your best deals," Trump said.</p><p>Earlier this month, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-states-supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban/1100-6528877/" data-ref-id="1100-6528877">US Supreme Court upheld TikTok's ban</a>, and the platform briefly went dark. It's back online, though the app remains unavailable for new users from the App Store and Google Play. Trump recently extended the deadline for TikTok to find a new owner in the US by 75 days, with the deadline now being April 4.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about national security over TikTok based on the company's ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. How a potential sale of TikTok might come together remains a mystery, whether it comes as a sale of TikTok's US operations, the platform entirely, or some other kind of deal beyond a total divestiture by ByteDance.</p><p>ByteDance is holding steady and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban-if-not-sold-by-chinese-trump-has-promised-a-solution" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying over and over that it will not sell.</a></p>
