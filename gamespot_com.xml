                <p>Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-may-get-season-2-thanks-to-super-response-from-players/1100-6536110/" data-ref-id="1100-6536110">sold a million copies in just 10 days</a>, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-of lists for the year.</a> That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it.</p><p>"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit," writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time.</p><p>Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things," he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBXNczRvheI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vBXNczRvheI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The industry was collapsing … We were right there," he said, adding that without contract work paying the bills, "we would have died three years ago." For years, the project mostly met rejection. “You have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven f---ing years," Shorette added, while Herman recalls being told, "This is dumb, don't do it."</p><p>Dispatch was also not always the game players recognize now. It began life as a live-action interactive TV project before COVID shut that version down. Early drafts were darker and more limited, focused on a single hero rather than a full team. Over time, the game evolved into a lighter and broader experience, shifting toward the dispatch system and the group of misfit superheroes that define it today. Even Robert, the main protagonist, wasn't voiced by Aaron Paul--actor Rahul Kohli was in line to take the role. For his part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saros/">Kohli stars in Saros</a>, which is scheduled to launch next April.</p><p>Now that Dispatch is out and doing well, the pressure has changed as Shorette compares it to a musician following up a debut album. "You have your whole life to write your first album and eight months to write your second." But after taking an absurdly long time to launch one season, Dispatch is no longer starting from nothing--and that makes a much faster follow-up possible.</p><p>Dispatch is out now on PS5 and PC. It launches January 28 for Switch and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It has been a big week for Larian Studios, which just announced its upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> to tons of fervor. Unfortunately, a lot of the week since the announcement has consisted of members of the studio, including its CEO Swen Vincke, fighting online about the team's current attitude towards AI tools in games development following an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Now, after a week of backlash, Larian is hoping to clear some of the air around Divinity and its use of AI. In a statement shared on Twitter, Vincke writes, "It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.<br>Larian’s DNA is agency.

(@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Vincke continues, "Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possible make."</p><p>To that end, Vincke states that it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies," but also claims that any aspect of the team's evolving processes that fails to "align with who we are" can and will be changed.</p><p>To clarify matters even more, and likely to take a bit of heat of off Vincke himself, Larian will be holding an AMA after the holidays. Representative of other departments at the studio will be present to field questions "about Divinity and our dev process directly." A date has yet to be announced, but will be shared in the new year.</p><p>In case you might've missed it, Vincke shared that Larian was openly embracing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI tools</a> for its development processes on Divinity. Though he stated that no AI work would be in thh game itself ("Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," Vincke told Bloomberg), Larian devs are, per his comments, using AI to insert placeholder text and generate concept art for the heavily anticipated RPG.</p><p>In response to the news that generative AI is being used on Divinity, Larian has come under fire from fans and other developers online. In response to the backlash, Vincke initially stated, "Holy f**k guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," and shared that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking.</p><p>Vincke, and Larian's, position on AI is hardly a surprise. Earlier this year, similar comments were made in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a> where Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do."</p>

                <p>The new Apple AirPods Pro 3 launched earlier this year, but the wireless earbuds are already seeing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a limited-time price cut at Amazon</a>, where you can snag a pair for $199. That's 20% off its normal $249 price tag and one of the lowest prices we've seen so far. The AirPods Pro 3 build upon the premium sound quality and feature set of previous models, offering better active noise cancelation (ANC), a longer battery life, and new functionality like auto-translation. If you're looking for a last-minute holiday gift or are looking to treat yourself to an upgrade, this is a great opportunity to pick them up.</p><div title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5295" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Apple AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$199 (was $249)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>As mentioned above, the AirPods 3 sport several upgrades over the previous models, including improved ANC.

The earbuds are also lightweight and come with five pairs of silicone ear tips. Battery life lasts up to eight hours on a full charge with ANC activated, and they come with a charging case that quickly recharges the battery.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you don't need super high-quality earbuds, you can get a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods 4 for $100</a>.
