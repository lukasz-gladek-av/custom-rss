                <p dir="ltr">I walked out of my Summer Game Fest 2025 demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mixtape/" data-ref-id="5000-631968">Mixtape</a> beaming like an idiot, a smile stuck on my face. I can't think of a game that has ever vibed as hard as Mixtape does. Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's debut, The Artful Escape, was a vibes game, too. Light on traditional gameplay mechanics and basically lacking any fail states, it instead leaned into aesthetics, mood, and tone. It was more of a feeling than a traditional game, but I loved it for that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are lots of vibes games, like Unpacking, Night in the Woods, and Firewatch, to name a few. I love a good vibes game, and Mixtape, the next game from the team behind The Artful Escape, feels like it could be the ultimate example. I played about 30 minutes of Mixtape and saw what you might call a few levels of the game, which plays like a '90s-set coming-of-age story but is meant to feel "sorta like channel-surfing [old-school] MTV at 3 AM," developer Johnny Galvatron told me.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Mixtape, you play a group of three high-school pals on the cusp of graduating and looking to make it to a party on the beach to cap off their childhood. The party is going to rule if they can just get there, and each figurative step toward that end goal is played out to a different song that collectively makes up one of the best licensed soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Joy Division, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins, and many more bring so much life to this game. Something about the joining of gaming and music has always been incredibly powerful to me, and Mixtape's way of bringing these things together sincerely blew my mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that the gameplay side of Mixtape is especially intricate. But it's always changing. The main mechanic seems like it'll be what you may have seen in the trailer: coasting downhill in a skateboard, dodging cars, flipping off cops, and stopping to sneak a couple of beers out of your house. But the game toys with not just this format--like a later level in which I led the police on a high-speed chase in a careening shopping cart--but also cleverly gamifies the group's friendship and experiences in other ways. I laughed out loud when I was hit with a French-kissing minigame, where each joystick controlled one tongue, and I was free to mash and swirl the tongues together in what is sure to become a viral moment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later scene, the teens were driving to a fast food restaurant and blasting music along the way, turning the moment into an interactive headbanging mechanic in which you'd move to the music and rock out with your buddies. There's no penalty for doing it poorly, and seemingly no demand you do it at all. Mixtape is largely on rails in a sense, in that it's paced to play out nearly the same no matter how much you toy with the world in these fleeting but emotionally impactful ways. For instance, you do need to French kiss for a bit, but even then, you can keep it going much longer if you want to, long after the prompt tells you "that's enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Mixtape is a hard game to describe. If you're not one to find music especially moving or important, you surely won't find the gameplay moments carry you through to having the same euphoric experience I and many others had at SGF--I've been hearing a lot of people call it their game of the show. However, if you're like me, and you have some mushy nostalgia for the '90s, a romantic view of bands like The Cure, and a willingness to let an experience be something quite unlike a traditional video game, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I have: Mixtape is transcendent.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Obviously, it's personal preference, but Nintendo GameCube has one of the most smile-inducing system startup sequences with its purple cubes rolling around to a catchy tune. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> owners can experience this delightful moment every time they open the GameCube app with one simple trick: holding the left stick in any direction.</p><p dir="ltr">The GameCube library is new to the Nintendo Classics collection with the introduction of Switch 2, though accessing it does require subscribing to the premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier ($50 annually for an individual, $80 for a family). As such, the regular bootup for the app just showcases the purple GameCube controller overlaid on a red background, similar to the Nintendo 64 or NES apps.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But moving and holding the left stick while jumping into the GameCube app transports you back to the early 2000s with the original startup sequence. It's a fun secret that injects you with nostalgic goodness or introduces you to how certain consoles used to greet players when turning them on. Now, keep in mind, only the left stick unlocks this Easter egg. Fiddling with the right stick didn't work.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/#7">the GameCube library on Switch 2</a> consists of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur II. Looking ahead, Nintendo is expected to add titles like Super Mario Sunshine, Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness, and Luigi's Mansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is also selling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-supports-gyro-controls/1100-6532159/">a GameCube controller for Switch 2 that has its own fun surprise</a>. The controller actually has gyroscope functionality, something that can be utilized in Splatoon 2 and 3--among other games. This is on top of the controller also adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-set-up-gamechat-on-switch-2/1100-6532152/">a C button for GameChat</a>, as well as Home and Capture buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 is available now and costs $450. GameSpot has handy info on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Switch 2 restocks</a> in the US for people who haven't been able to snag a console yet.</p>

It's not Dying Light 3, but the team told me it feels The Beast is the best version of what the Dying Light series has been since it debuted a decade ago. I played 30 minutes of The Beast during Summer Game Fest Play Days 2025, and though its story still seems to be a comic-booky saga I struggle to get invested in, I'm definitely on board for some of what's it's bringing--and bringing back--to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">My demo started just before nightfall, and if you know Dying Light, you know it's not so easy to survive when the sun goes down. The new map in The Beast features a lot of forest area, which I really liked playing in. A developer told me the game is meant to be scarier than before, and the signature parkour gameplay has actually been dialed back a little bit to match The Beast protagonist Kyle Crane's canon abilities. He can't jump quite as far as Dying Light 2: Stay Human's Aiden Caldwell, which grounds the game a bit, even as so much of it remains over-the-top.</p><p dir="ltr">Crane is a fan-favorite protagonist from the first game and returns to this one on a revenge mission, chasing down the man who ruined his life. The story in these games resonates with a great number of its fans, but I've not counted myself among them. I don't expect The Beast to change that, but the series has always achieved its core gameplay goals, and that aspect seems well in place once more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509291"></a><figcaption>The Beast is set many years after the events of the first Dying Light, and Crane still has a bone to pick.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509291-dyinglight1.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One change is the return of guns, which have never been (and still won't be) in abundant supply. But because Crane will encounter some heavily armed soldiers at times, players will be able to take their weapons, like an assault rifle, shotgun, and--totally new to the series--a flamethrower that worked well as a room-clearing tool.</p><p dir="ltr">Driving is back, too, which Techland previously introduced in Dying Light: The Following, an expansion for the original Dying Light. Instead of the buggy featured in the expansion, I drove a hefty pick-up truck, which helped me quickly transport some materials I needed for a mission. This was much better than lugging them by hand, and the driving mechanics felt great. I learned Techland used to make rally racing games before Dying Light, and the same designer in charge of those mechanics is still at Techland today and helped bring the driving gameplay to life in Dying Light: The Beast. Driving was a lot of fun, and though the map will sometimes naturally restrict where players can drive, the opportunities to do so don't feel like missing the point despite the series' emphasis on running and parkour moves.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the Dying Light's great strengths has always been the open-endedness of navigating its world. The parkour makes the landscape your playground, and I got to mess with multiple strategies for problem-solving in one encounter. Spotting some armed guards up ahead, I sneakily dashed away to scale a nearby building, dodging zombies at the ground level. When I reached the top, I pulled out a decoy grenade and sent the undead horde toward the guards. As they cut into each other's numbers, I crept onward toward my objective. Up ahead, more guards rested atop the building, and it was here I leaned into the game's best combat maneuver: the dropkick.</p><p dir="ltr">I said I haven't always enjoyed the series' comic-booky side, but here, I was all too pleased to missile-dropkick anyone and everyone who stood in my way. Like the I Think You Should Leave sketch in which Tim Robinson's character refuses to stop fake-pouring water on his colleague during a work seminar, I sensed the dev accompanying me on my demo was astounded at how committed to the move I was. My melee weapons didn't degrade, my ammo was plentiful, all because I just couldn't stop dropkicking every face I saw, be it grossly mushy or tactically masked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4509305"></a><figcaption>The game's visuals still depict dueling aesthetics of grime and shine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4509305-tp34zuby.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I played the second game like this at times, too. The physics of the move is too satisfying to ignore. It's just too much fun. I know I was sort of defying how the demo was expected to go, but I've played a lot of Dying Light over the years, so I felt like I could take this moment and really indulge my base desires: dropkicking every ambulating humanoid I encountered like prime Dolph Ziggler.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you kill that guy, you'll get his gun," the dev told me before I dropkicked the armed soldier off of a roof.</p><p dir="ltr">"The bow and arrow is a one-shot if you hit them in the head," he later said, hinting I should give it a whirl, before I unequipped it and launched several guys into a vent with my feet.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now that you've enhanced the axe, it'll immediately jump to your level. It was a Level 6 weapon, but you're Level 9, so enhancing it has made it a Level 9. We wanted players to be able to take their favorite weapons with them throughout the game if they really find one they love," he explained. "I see," I replied, before I pocketed it and dropkicked several more zombies into a wall.</p><p dir="ltr">I apologized, but the move is simply too good, I said. He seemed to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">Dying Light: The Beast benefits from years of updates to Dying Light 2, while also pulling in elements from the first that Techland wanted to revisit. This mix of old and new feels like it's going to make the 20-hour game (40 to 60 for completionists) well worth it if you're already invested in the series. I'm looking forward to driving more, exploring a new, scarier environment, and testing the weapon enhancement system in those rare moments when I elect to do anything other than Roddy Piper the undead in every street, rooftop, and forest I run through.</p>
