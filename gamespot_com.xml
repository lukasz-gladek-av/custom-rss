                <p>If you ever wondered what the Kentucky Derby would look like if attendees traded big hats for medieval garb, Bohemia Interactive has you covered. Today, the developer released Patch 1.3 for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which, among other big changes, brings horse racing to the game--along with a few new quests to boot.</p><p dir="ltr">The horse racing activity can be found in the Nomads' camp in the province of Trosky, and players can participate in either cross-country races or mounted archery competitions. Three new quests related to horse racing will also be added: Horses for Courses, Racing Horseshoes, and The Executioner's Edge.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH9pzsEsC4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AH9pzsEsC4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The patch also includes dozens of fixes across the entire game, including improved fast travel speed while riding a horse, a fix for a bug where Henry's trusty dog Mutt would at times randomly attack him, and more. The full patch notes for the 1.3 update can be found on the <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-1-3" rel="nofollow ">official KCD2 website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.3 launches alongside Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's first paid DLC story expansion, Brushes With Death. In it, Henry must help a mysterious painter character complete his life's work--and in the process, discover secrets from his past.</p><p dir="ltr">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. PC. Brushes With Death is sold separately, and as part of both the KCD2 Expansion Pass and Gold Edition.</p>

Blizzard additionally used the update to introduce a major quality-of-life change, one that it initially forgot to include in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.2.1, released on May 14, added the ability to turn in Tree of Whisper bounties from any major city, with Ravens of the Tree now located in Cerrigar, Gea Kul, Ked Bardu, Kyovashad, Kurast, and Zarbinzet. It's actually a feature originally part of Season 7 that has now been added to the game permanently.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"This is a commonly requested feature from Season 7 that has been brought back into the game to help players save time on Whisper events," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said in a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/patch-221-raven-of-the-trees-now-found-in-each-major-town/222502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "This was originally missing from the patch notes, but we will be updating the notes to include this feature."</p><p dir="ltr">It might not sound like much, but being able to turn in Whisper bounties in major cities where players likely are already spending their time significantly speeds up the entire bounty running process. Instead of completing 10 bounties, having to navigate to the map, travel to the Tree of Whispers, turn in, and then teleport back to their previous location, players can simply travel to a nearby town and turn it in immediately, or wait for when they are already in town doing various other activities to do it then.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature has since been added to the official <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> with a comment from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">"We recognized that backtracking to the tree to turn in Whispers made for a bloated gameplay loop," the patch notes read. "A Raven of the Tree was added to each capital city to cut down on turn in time."</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes in the update, numerous Spiritborn skills and passives have received buffs, along with buffs for multiple Druid passives and some significant damage increases for Barbarian items like Ghor's Devastating Grips and Twin Strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been a few season-specific improvements as well. The boss power Sinerat's Flame received a 25% damage buff, and Apparition Incursions are now both easier to find on the map and spawn Betraying Eyes, needed for some seasonal journey objectives, more consistently. For more details on what all is included in update 2.2.1, be sure to read the full patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 8 started April 29 and brought major, permanent changes to the ARPG's endgame bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">making them stronger but more rewarding</a>.

Early reviews are incredibly positive, with critics pointing out the headphones impeccable noise-canceling skills and ultra-comfortable design.</p><div title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3524" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony WH-1000XM6 - Noise-Canceling Wireless Headphones</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$448 at Amazon | $450 at Best Buy</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony made two big upgrades with these new headphones. First and foremost is the new noise-cancelling processor. The QN3 is said to be seven times faster than the processor found in the XM5, resulting in enhanced active noise cancellation. Using 12 microphones, it can sense and react to noises in your environment, quickly adapting its performance to reduce ambient sound.</p><p>The other big addition is a folding design. Sony abandoned this with the XM5, and while the folding system isn’t identical to the older XM4, the end result is the same. Thanks to metal joints, you can swivel and fold the earcups, making them easy to transport in the included carrying case.</p></div>                      </div><p>You’ll get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, a wider headband for added support and comfort, and a six-microphone system that picks up and transmits crisp audio for phone calls. Of course, it also benefits from enhanced drivers, which should provide clearer audio for all your content. The headphones are available in black, midnight blue, and silver.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade your audio but don’t want to drop $450, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM4</a> headphones are currently on sale. The XM5 are $348 (was $400) and the XM4 are $298 (was $348). The XM5 offer superior noise-canceling chops compared to the XM4--but they lack the ability to fold, making them a bit more cumbersome for travel or storage. The XM4 are also on sale for $50 off, though audio quality and ANC aren’t quite up to par with the newer XM5.</p><p>The XM6 essentially combines the best aspects of both headphones while also improving overall performance. Be sure to give all three a look before deciding which is best for your needs. There are plenty of other great headphones available in 2025, and you’ll find a few of our favorites below. </p><h2>More Noise-Canceling Headphones</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM4</a> -- $298 (<del>$348</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> -- $348 (<del>$400</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods Max</a> -- $500 (<del>$549</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/dp/B0CCZ26B5V?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort</a> -- $349</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Wireless-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0CCZ1L489?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a> -- $429</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQ2TBSPV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sennheiser Momentum 4</a> -- $316 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Wireless-Headphones-Matte/dp/B0CZPLV566?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Solo 4</a> -- $130 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> -- $170 (<del>$350</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomtoc-releases-nintendo-switch-2-version-of-its-popular-form-fitting-travel-case/1100-6531332/">Tomtoc Releases Nintendo Switch 2 Version Of Its Popular Form-Fitting Travel Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-store-star-wars-day-sale-2025-jango-fett-ucs-starship-free-lego-sets/1100-6530872/">Lego Star Wars Day Sale Is Live - Get Two Free Sets With Jango Fett's UCS Starship</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-all-launch-games-buy-amazon-walmart-best-buy-target/1100-6531115/">All The Nintendo Switch 2 Games You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/studio-ghibli-movies-limited-edition-steelbook-blu-ray-best-deals-amazon-walmart/1100-6530746/">Studio Ghibli Movies With Collectible Steelbooks Are Available For Cheap</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Playing video games is getting more expensive these days, with companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Nintendo and Microsoft announcing plans to charge $80 for games</a>, and consumers are ready and willing to embrace the higher price points. That's according to analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics.</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raised-xbox-console-and-game-prices-analysts-say-playstation-and-everyone-else-could-be-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that with Nintendo and Xbox announcing price hikes on games, "the floodgates are now open." He expects every publisher in video games that can raise prices to do so.</p><p>"The market will bear it. Plenty of gamers are willing to pay price points above $70, as shown by the high numbers of those willing to pay $100 for a few days' early access," Elliott said.</p><p>He added that, even in challenging economic times, people will spend money on what they want the most, including video games. "The rising prices won’t necessarily reduce spending. The market will bear it. Early adopters will always be early adopters," he said.</p><p>Before this, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said entertainment is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-is-not-worried-about-global-economic-turmoil-impacting-its-games/1100-6531397/" data-ref-id="1100-6531397">"fundamental human need,"</a> and as such, he's not worried about the global economic climate negatively impacting video games.</p><p>Newzoo's Manu Rosier, meanwhile, said rising game prices may lead to shifts in how money is spent, with consumers becoming potentially "more selective" with what they buy. A consumer may respond to rising individual game prices by "spending less on individual full-priced titles and more on subscriptions, discounted bundles, or long-tail live-service games," he said.</p><p>"The total spend may remain steady or even grow modestly, but the distribution across formats and platforms will likely continue to evolve. Xbox's pricing changes, and similar moves by others, could accelerate this transition toward services and ecosystems over standalone product purchases," Rosier said.</p><p>Game prices are not going up universally, as 2K Games just announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country will go for $50</a> when it launches in August. But history shows that there have always been lower-priced games in the market at the same time as higher-priced ones. Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1921280736901882167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "$50 games in 2025 is just the new $40 games from the PS4 gen and $30 games from the PS2 gen. They've always existed and usually been the price point for titles that aren't quite AAA in nature."</p><p>Mat Piscatella of Circana added that he believes consumers may shift towards free-to-play games and other "more easily accessible forms of games."</p><p>"Games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, etc. will likely see even more players and hours spent in their ecosystems. Players will also rely on and continue to play devices they already own a bit more rather than buy new hardware," he said. "And, as prices rise in everyday spending categories like food, gas, shelter, automotive, etc, there will be fewer and fewer dollars available for categories like gaming in the U.S."</p><p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">first $80 game is Mario Kart World</a>, which is a launch title for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--so far, it's the only game that Nintendo has confirmed will carry that price point. As for Microsoft, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will start charging $80 for some games later this year</a>, but the company has not said which ones.</p><p>Beyond game prices going up, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising Xbox prices</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">Sony might do the same</a>, in part due to the impact of tariffs. The Switch 2's $450 price point, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">is $50 more expensive than the original Switch was in 2017</a> with inflation factored in.

<section><p>Even just a few hours was enough to show the power of WoW's upcoming housing-decoration systems, which Blizzard plans on expanding for years to come.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>There's a reason Blizzard used <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> 20th-anniversary livestream in November 2024 as the stage to finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">announce player housing</a>. It's likely to be the biggest feature in the game's two-decade history: a huge undertaking that players have wanted Blizzard to commit to since WoW first launched back in 2004. The news that Blizzard was finally rolling up its sleeves and tackling it was a huge deal that had players buzzing with ideas, possibilities, and more than a few concerns.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is buzzing with ideas and possibilities, too. That much is clear after spending several hours going hands-on with an early version of WoW's player housing and talking to the developers behind it. There's no shortage of "what if this was possible?" or "that's a great idea!" conversations during my day at Blizzard's Boston office. It's the first time a group of players outside Blizzard have been able to take the game's player-housing decoration tools for a spin, and the team seems eager to learn what members of the press and various WoW content creators in attendance think, both good and bad. Blizzard employees are constantly jotting down ideas or making notes about player feedback. It's almost as if you can see light bulbs going off in real time about what might be possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The basics of player housing seem set in stone--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/">actual mechanics of decorating a home</a>, the philosophy behind all players being homeowners, and the social-driven nature of the entire endeavor--and have already been officially detailed by Blizzard in a series of blog posts dedicated to the subject. Every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/">player who wants a house will be able to get one</a>, and homes will be located in neighborhoods (one for each faction) where players will have persistent neighbors. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/">Home decor will be doled out as quest rewards</a>, from professions, and other areas of the game. Those are the major facts we already knew, but the finer details, as well as the big ideas for what the housing system could be potentially capable of in the future, all still feel a bit ethereal.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard seems well aware it hasn't thought of everything when it comes to housing. It's both a little concerning but also, in a strange way, refreshing. There is an air of possibility that comes with seeing such a game-changing feature still in its infancy. Blizzard has made clear that the version of housing that will launch as part of the Midnight expansion (or, as has been heavily implied, ahead of it) will just be a starting point. It won't launch with 20 years of assets at the beginning, nor will all the tools and functions players might like to see be there on day one.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead game designer Toby Ragaini says the first version of housing Blizzard is shipping will be "an initial step." The team is already planning multiple years ahead for a feature that hasn't even launched yet, he said, and the size and scope of the endeavor is definitely a little intimidating.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a huge responsibility," Ragaini tells GameSpot. "Players have been asking for player housing for decades now. The belief has always been we will release it when we feel like we can do it justice. We were determined not to just simply meet players' expectations; we needed to exceed them…It's something that's going to be with the game for as long as there is WoW. We really couldn't do a half measure."</p><p dir="ltr">At least on the housing-decoration front, Blizzard already seems poised to exceed expectations. While much of what we experienced as part of the hands-on housing demo has already been "revealed," actually using the systems for myself, and seeing them used in the hands of a pro like Jay Hwang--a principal artist on WoW and the player housing system's lead decoration designer--completely changed my preconceived opinion on what the housing tools could be capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">On its surface, WoW's house-decoration system is simple. Players will have a collection of decor earned from quests, bought from vendors, or gained through other sources, that can be placed within a home. A house is capable of holding thousands and thousands of decor objects. Decor can be placed simply using the game's Basic placement mode, in which decor will attempt to snap to walls, ceilings, or floors without fuss. For finer placement, players can turn on Advanced mode, which disables decor collision and can be used for more granular positioning. Players can additionally rotate and resize decor. As Blizzard has previously revealed, a player's home on the inside can be as big or small as they want, ranging from just one room to a mansion of dozens. There are a variety of different room layouts to choose from, including pre-built staircase rooms that can be used to create a multi-story home. A top-down room layout mode makes it simple to add or delete rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">For the demo, Blizzard starts each player with a few pre-decorated rooms made by Hwang to help players to get an idea for what might be possible, and from there it's on each participant to explore their creativity and push the decorating tools to their limit in whatever way they see fit. As someone who is not typically into home building or decorating (both in-game or in real-life), it's a little nerve-wracking trying to be creative and cook up a cool room while curious Blizzard employees look over my shoulder, eager to see how I interact with the systems they've long been working on.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite not being a survival-crafting player accustomed to placing walls and adjusting objects, it isn't long before I'm putting together a magical study or a Forsaken-themed dungeon, all with relative ease. I found WoW's housing tools extremely simple to use, albeit with a few minor frustrations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662"></a><figcaption>A room I built using WoW's interior-decoration tools.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The basics are easy. Clicking and dragging decor, resizing them, and placing them in the 3D space works like you would expect it to, which is a bigger compliment than it might seem. A hotbar of housing tools at the bottom of the screen lets players easily swap between modes, whether it's decor placement or changing the color of decor with various dyes. Some basic functionality you might expect, like the ability to place an object multiple times or copy and paste it in some way, isn't currently present, resulting in a bit of menu fatigue as you need to open the menu, click an object, place it, and then rinse and repeat every single time. Despite that and my lack of virtual-home-building skills, slapping together a room still felt relatively quick, and I came away happy with the handful of rooms I was able to create in the span of a few hours.</p><p dir="ltr">While actually assembling rooms felt straightforward in a positive way, I did fairly quickly begin to find the list of decor I could use lacking. All of the basics are there: various chairs, rugs, lamps, beds, and tables. Many of the decor items are themed around various WoW races like Humans, Blood Elves, Night Elves, Tauren, and others. Hwang says it's a priority for the team to let players decorate their homes according to various race and class fantasies, and so Blizzard focused on providing those kinds of decorating assets first, though there are a few oddball items, like two different guillotines, as well. Overall, the number of decor items on offer is serviceable, but still feels like there are too few objects to satisfy those truly looking to create their Azerothian dream hom54e.</p><p dir="ltr">That was, until I started paying more attention to the Advanced mode, thanks in part to a live demo Hwang gives that shows off the decorating tool's full power. Because using Advanced mode eliminates object collision and ignores the standard object-snapping rules, it can be used to essentially make entirely new objects out of existing ones. Suddenly, a bookshelf floating in the middle of a wall can become a kitchen cabinet. A fence angled in mid-air in a particular way can become a stair railing. A container, moved halfway under the floor and combined with a small pillow, can become a cat bed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664"></a><figcaption>An example of what's possible using the decoration system's Advanced mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's in the Advanced decoration mode where the true genius of WoW's player-housing system is hidden. Suddenly, the possibilities seem nearly endless, even more so when combined with the ability to resize objects and to use additional walls, pillars, and other objects to transform cookie-cutter room layouts into unique ones or even turn a single room into an entire multi-room home in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Once I started to look at objects not exactly as they were, but in terms of their individual pieces and components, it was as if an entire new realm of possibility had been unlocked. There aren't just hundreds of decor items to use--there are thousands, all of which can be used in all manner of creative ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Hwang says he is a fan of games where building houses is a key component, like Valheim and Minecraft, and wanted to create a decoration system with both simple and more-complex tools. As he continued to work on the decorating system and bumped into various limitations, he began to ask if it would be possible to incorporate more and more features, like Advanced mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We got to where it is because we are the kind of player we are making the feature for," Hwang says.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of our hands-on demo time, it's difficult not to be impressed by what everyone in attendance has accomplished. One player crafted a 3D-platforming maze. Another made an elaborate wrestling arena. Others combined decor or used the Advanced mode to craft items and rooms that I couldn't even comprehend how'd they'd done it, much less try to replicate it myself. If this is what a handful of people can create in the span of just a few hours, what will the game's playerbase of millions come up with once it's fully in their hands? With the tools Blizzard is providing, it's easy to see players creating dance clubs, taverns, casinos, sprawling apartment complexes, and everything in between. Add in the fact that the decor available at launch will be just a fraction of the total possible decor assets in the game, all of which can be manipulated in all kinds of unforeseen ways, and it's easy to be overwhelmed at the possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">"Those two decades of content for WoW [are] enormously valuable right now," Ragaini says. "Suddenly, all these assets, every piece of furniture you've ever seen in the game, for example, is something that could potentially, and fairly easily, be turned into decor for the player. We're not going to hit every single one--there [are] tens of thousands of items at that scale--but we'll get there eventually. It's just a matter of prioritization."</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that Blizzard has built a powerful tool--one that hands players the keys to the proverbial castle and says, "Go wild." In a game that has become increasingly on rails over the last two decades, and where many expansion-specific systems in the past have often felt restrictive and intended to be engaged with in a very specific way, the feeling of freedom found in the housing-decorating system caught me off guard. That this is the tool in what is essentially its first form, before UI improvements, added features, and thousands upon thousands more decor objects, is even more astounding.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when those improvements and additional decor rewards will be coming, Blizzard won't say. After all, it's not even ready to disclose when housing is officially arriving. But like many other more recent WoW features like skyriding, hero talents, or delves, Blizzard is treating housing as an ongoing evergreen feature and not a one-off expansion bullet point for Midnight. Ragaini says Blizzard already has a multi-year content roadmap for housing, but it's leaving ample room for player feedback and suggestions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to be listening," Ragaini says. "We're going to be iterating and improving from day one. It would be premature to have this perfectly laid-out plan, because that would assume we know perfectly well how players will respond."</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to imagine players spending dozens upon dozens of hours building fantastical rooms and elaborate homes once housing launches: an entire game within an already massive one. Blizzard's hope is that by giving a home to essentially every player who wants one, it will become a core pillar of the game moving forward, with housing rewards sprinkled throughout the game's various activities serving as a feedback loop for players to return to their home and see what new items they unlocked after completing dungeons or unlocking an achievement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666"></a><figcaption>Neighborhoods will be an important part of WoW player housing, but details are still light.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If, however, a player has no real interest in spending much time in their home, Blizzard says that's fine too. There will be "prefab" rooms designed to already look like specific parts of a house, such as a foyer, that players will be able to place down and quickly decorate for those who don't want to get into the nitty-gritty details of building themselves. Ultimately, Blizzard says that if a player doesn't want to engage with housing at all, they don't have to. There will be no player power associated with housing, and Blizzard seems very keen to not repeat the mistakes of Warlords of Draenor's Garrisons, where players could gather crafting materials and essentially access everything they ever needed without having to leave their own personal base. As one of the core design goals behind housing is for it to be a social experience, Blizzard wants to avoid the pitfall of having homes be a place for things like a mission table or an herb garden that would eliminate reasons to venture out into Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">If there was one landmine Blizzard seems primed to step on during the demo, it's a prominent "shop" icon located directly in the housing decoration interface. Though it isn't functioning during the hands-on, Blizzard confirms that it will, in theory, take players to WoW's in-game cash shop, where certain housing items will be available for purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">That raises a few alarm bells, to say the least, if for no other reason than it would be the first time a button to the in-game shop was displayed so prominently, as it's normally relegated to WoW's main menu or a small button in the right corner of the game's UI. Blizzard emphasizes that it plans to treat player-housing items for sale just as it does mounts and other cosmetics currently, and that the majority of items for housing will be earnable through gameplay. That being said, Blizzard seems open to the idea of removing the shop tab from the decorating interface, though whether or not that will actually happen by launch remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, at the end of the day, seems open to a lot of things when it comes to housing, as it hones in on what the feature will look like initially but banks ideas for the future. It's poised to be the biggest evergreen addition to WoW in the game's 21-year life, but it's also one that may not reach its full potential for many years to come: a fact that Blizzard isn't shying away from. There are still plenty of unknowns, like additional details about player neighborhoods, the ability to decorate the outside of homes, and the cadence and scarcity of decor rewards. Those are all things Blizzard isn't ready to talk about just yet, and any one of them, if not done correctly, could potentially derail one of the most important features in WoW history. Even still, this early version of the housing-decoration system, and the creativity it is likely to unleash, feels special. It may have taken over two decades to become a reality, but if Blizzard can stick the landing, WoW's player housing system could be worth the wait.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-499449">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a> is the anime MMORPG Blue Protocol brought back from the dead, only it's from a completely different development team and, unlike the original Blue Protocol, will actually be receiving a Western release later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">You may remember Blue Protocol as a long-in-development MMO from Bandai Namco. The game was released in Japan in 2023, with a planned Western release in conjunction with Amazon Games planned for 2024. Unfortunately, the game struggled to find an audience, and Bandai Namco announced last year it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">end service for Blue Protocol in January 2025, with its Western release also canceled</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aI_qVWHiHnQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Chinese gaming giant Tencent has struck a deal with Bandai Namco to use Blue Protocol's assets, and under a new studio called Shanghai Bokura Network Technology, has essentially rebuilt and will be rereleasing Blue Protocol with a new subtitle: Star Resonance. It's slated to release this year on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and on mobile devices, with cross-play and cross-progression between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is now confirmed for a Western release, it still doesn't have an exact release date. The original Blue Protocol was originally slated to release on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 as well as PC, but at least for now, Star Resonance appears to be on PC and mobile only.</p><p dir="ltr">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance has actually been playable in beta form in China, and playtesters have already reported quite a number of changes from Bandai Namco's version. The game still features an anime-aesthetic, but its visuals are now closer to the look of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/" data-ref-id="5000-500614">Genshin Impact</a>. Players have also reported significant combat changes and updates to Blue Protocol's various progression systems, as well as new classes. While it will feature some of the gacha mechanics games like Genshin Impact are known for, they will be relegated to cosmetic items like costumes and weapon skins.</p>
