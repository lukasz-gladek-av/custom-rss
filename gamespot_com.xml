                <p>It's the start of the weekend in Destiny 2, and like clockwork, Xur has set up shop once again in the Tower. With the start of the new Heresy episode, it's a good idea to pay a visit to the arms dealer to see if he has any Exotic or legendary-class gear that can synergize with all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/">new weapons that have been introduced</a>. For more on Heresy, you can also check out these tips for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-episode-heresy-best-builds-for-hunter-warlock-and-titan/1100-6529242/">best builds for your Guardian</a> during the new episode and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/">how the new Nether activity works</a>. Here's a closer look at what Xur has for sale this weekend.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for Coldheart and Sturm, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up Khepri's Sting; Titans can grab Antaeus Wards; and Warlocks can buy Vesper of Radius. If you're looking for Exotic weapons, Xur has Hawkmoon, Arbalest, Coldheart, and D.A.R.C.I this week. He's also shifting the Exotic vehicle, The Xurfboard, instead of his usual Exotic class item.</p><p>The Anataeus Wards in particular are worth grabbing for Titans, as they roll at a huge 69 total value, with good values in resilience, strength, and recovery. The Vesper of Radius for Warlocks also has a 30-roll in recovery, meaning healing in the Nether activity is going to be improved with this Exotic equipped.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440366" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4440366"></a><figcaption>Xur's location in the Tower Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4440366-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44. Continue down the stairs, follow the corridor, and once you hit the Bazaar, turn right down the nearby alleyway. You'll find Xur here in his dedicated alcove, ready to sell you his latest wares if you have enough Strange Coins in your pocket.

conducts business in The Final Shape and its episodes. For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn bonus Strange Coins from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

                <p>Avowed game director Carrie Patel has discussed Obsidian's effort to "make everything intentional" in the RPG, and that meant not simply following other fantasy tropes but instead crafting the game to stand on its own. Among other things, this means there was no rule for Avowed that said dwarves had to have a Scottish accent like they do in lots of other fantasy media.</p><p>"With all our games, and certainly with the lore of Pillars, we want to make everything intentional," Patel said in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/07/avowed-living-lands-next-great-frontier-for-obsidian/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>. "Dwarves don't need to have Scottish accents just because they do in other fantasy settings, and elves don't need to all speak with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Received-Pronunciation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Received Pronunciation</a>."</p><p>Instead, Patel said an intentional effort was made to focus on "stripping back those tropes" for Avowed to stand out.</p><p>"One example was the idea of mountain dwarves tending to be more itinerant. Traditional dwarven societies build impressive places but then scatter and move on due to resources, personal disagreements, or political rifts," Patel said. "This created an interesting opportunity for us in Avowed to explore: What it would be like if one of these settlements stuck around. What would that culture be like? Why would those characters have made that decision, and what would that mean for the story?"</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>In addition to Avowed, Obsidian is currently at work making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 is finally in the hands of players who paid for early access, and one of the 4X strategy game's weirder bugs has already been discovered. During Age transitions, players can hear weird noises, some of which sound like coughing, when picking a new civilization to play as.</p><p>One of the biggest changes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization 7</a> makes to the series' core formula is that playthroughs are split into three Ages. Players pick a new civilization to control at the start of each new Age. A piece of music plays in the background as players do this, but fans quickly started hearing weird audio as they did this and discussed their findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>. There was speculation that some unintentional sounds made their way into the orchestral music track already, but the Civilization 7 support website revealed the actual issue.</p><p>"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises. This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens," <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a support page explains</a>. "This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JeYvr1q4Ev8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, players hear the Leaders' idle voice lines and actions that typically play on Civilization VII's main menu screen while they're mid-playthrough. Currently, 2K and Firaxis have not outlined any clear way to resolve this issue. They're aware of the issue and have already committed to thorough <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/" data-ref-id="1100-6529313">post-launch support for Civilization 7</a>, so hopefully, a fix isn't too far off.</p><p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 will get a wide release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on February 11. You can play now if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/" data-ref-id="1100-6525971">purchase the more expensive Deluxe or Founder's editions</a> of the game.</p>

                <p>Sea of Thieves players should be wary when Season 15 launches on February 20, as two new megalodons will be creeping in the waters. But should pirates be able to take down these fearsome sea creatures, they'll have new spots in the game's world to sell their megalodon meat.</p><p>Season 15, titled "Wild Things," expands the Hunter's Call trading company, which offers rewards and gold in exchange for fish, cooked meat, and other items. The company's vendors are scattered around the sea in tiny, lonely Seaposts, but Season 15 will incorporate them into the game's seven Outposts, according to a <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/this-month-february2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves blog post</a>.</p><p>The new megalodon variants are the Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread, with an X post from the Sea of Thieves account sharing a look at a megalodon covered in what appear to be yellow and purple crystals. The blog post states that these megalodons have "devastating new abilities" that will challenge even the most experienced buccaneers.</p><p>Players can also expect new voyages, a hunting spear item, "untamed wildlife," and other features. Eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbah25t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves fans noticed</a> a spotted variant of pig in the teaser image, which also led to speculation that players can have pigs as pets, and a treasure chest with the Hunter's Call emblem, which may indicate new types of loot.</p><p>Unlike the other trading companies in Sea of Thieves, Hunter's Call has no emissary flag or unique voyages, so <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Seaofthieves/comments/1ij2o26/season_15_wild_things_released_february_20th/mbalhwy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">players are hoping</a> Season 15 will add more to the Hunter's Call progress experience and endgame.</p><p>Until the launch of the season, pirates can participate in limited-time <a href="https://x.com/SeaOfThieves/status/1887803559414047123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Fortress Raids</a> beginning February 14 and earn tons of loot from fighting Phantoms at Sea Forts. Hopefully, Sea of Thieves Season 15 will have a smoother launch than the previous season, where developer Rare had to temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-removing-its-new-stealth-features-following-season-14-launch-issues/1100-6527342/" data-ref-id="1100-6527342">roll back some new features</a> due to technical issues.</p>
