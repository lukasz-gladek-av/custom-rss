                <p>For the past eight years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-go-review/1900-6416477/" data-ref-id="1900-6416477">Pokemon Go</a> players have helped make Niantic's game one of the top titles in mobile gaming. Apparently, players have also been helping Niantic create a 3D model of the world, which is being expanded via AI into a Large Geospatial Model.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic made <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the largely unnoticed announcement</a> earlier this month. These plans have seemingly been in the works for a long time, and the company states that it is attempting to "help computers perceive, comprehend, and navigate the physical world." It also compares Large Geospatial Models to the Large Language Models used by OpenAI's GPT, Grok, and others.</p><p>Because Pokemon Go players are able to visit locations that cars can't access, they've given Niantic views of buildings and areas that other models haven't been able to see until now. Niantic explained that only the fronts of buildings have been identifiable from previous models, but the Large Geospatial Models can teach computers how to see and identify the other sides of buildings on a global scale.</p><p>One way Pokemon Go players have unwittingly contributed to this is through the recently released Pokemon Playgrounds feature, which lets them leave behind a Pokemon at a specific spot that can be found by other players. Niantic states that 10 million locations have been scanned through that feature from around the world, and 1 million new scans arrive every week.</p><p>According to the map of the model on Niantic's site, the company is far from mapping the entire globe. Most of the locations captured appear to be in North America and Europe, while Africa, Australia, and a large portion of Asia remain uncaptured for now. South America also has a long way to go before it will be fully captured by Niantic's AI model.</p><p>Outside of Pokemon Go, the franchise continues to thrive. This week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-gold-silver-review/1900-2536200/" data-ref-id="1900-2536200">Pokemon Gold and Silver</a> is getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gold-and-silver-is-getting-some-awesome-25th-anniversary-merch/1100-6527809/" data-ref-id="1100-6527809">a line of 25th- anniversary merchandise</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, one of the franchise's other mobile games, attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-pushes-past-30-million-downloads-tops-app-store-chart/1100-6527660/" data-ref-id="1100-6527660">30 million downloads</a> in its first week alone.

                <p>Blizzard has revealed its new Overwatch 2 hero, Hazard, in an animated trailer. Ahead of the launch of season 14 on December 10, you'll be able to play with the character from November 22-25.</p><p>Named Hazardous Tactics, the animated trailer showcases a heist on Oasis, spearheaded by The Phreaks gang. Hazard, nicknamed Haz by the video captions, fuses himself with a strange substance to gain supernatural strength, with visible spikes around his body. In addition, he has a minigun for a right arm, and a Scottish accent. Developer Activision Blizzard said there'll be new details on Hazard and his abilities later this week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR8N3cXWxqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sR8N3cXWxqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">Overwatch: Classic</a> is still available in Overwatch 2 until December 2. In this mode, you can only access the original roster of 21 heroes, as well as their original abilities. If you miss the old-school depictions of some of the available characters, Overwatch: Classic should scratch that nostalgic itch.</p><p>If you miss the 6v6 player matches from the first Overwatch, don't fret. The developer will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">conducting tests</a> during Season 14--the first will require a hero in each role, while the second test, slated for later in the season, will involve a classic 2-2-2 role composition with some tweaks.</p>

                <p>The topic of AI is already clouding the outlook of various industries, including video games. No one knows what that will mean for the future of game development, but Remedy--the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-ultimate-edition-cloud-version-review/1900-6417600/" data-ref-id="1900-6417600">Control</a>--has clarified its stance on the topic while revealing that the company has utilized it for years.</p><p>"AI is a very wide topic," said chief technology officer Mika Vehkala during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's recent financial presentation</a>. "Remedy has been using various AI models and techniques before the recent emergence and interest towards [it] happened. We are constantly working with our partners to look for opportunities that this can give. We are actually using some of these tools that are more popular and suit our needs at the moment."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7o3vvH49IM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I7o3vvH49IM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vehkala and chief product officer Markus Mäki also stressed that Remedy isn't using AI to replace creative jobs or actors. Instead, the company is using the technology to handle the "dull" parts of game development like tracking movements through motion-capture performances. Vehkala also disclosed that Remedy has a dedicated person at the company whose job requires them to keep an eye on the emerging tech. But he added that Remedy is not rushing into it.</p><p>In October, Remedy shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the upcoming spin-off from Control that will be released in 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2's DLC</a> was recently revealed to have a teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-will-lean-more-into-rpg-mechanics/1100-6527864/" data-ref-id="1100-6527864">Control 2</a>. That game doesn't currently have a release window. But those aren't the only titles among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/">Remedy's future games</a> that could be affected by the company's use of AI.</p>

These XP tokens were originally added in with the Season 1 update, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-2xp-token-issue-after-fan-outcry/1100-6527821/">developer removed them shortly after</a>, claiming that they were connected to a UI bug with potential risk to game stability.
