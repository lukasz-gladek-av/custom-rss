Price points are going up, but it appears 007 First Light is sticking with the $70 price that's been in place for years for AAA games.</p>

<p>If you want to spend more on the new James Bond game from the makers of Hitman, you'll apparently be able to. Another Amazon listing reveals a collector's edition that costs $300. There is no word on what may be in the collector's edition to justify the price tag, but the description says the package weighs six pounds. Listings for the $300 edition were discovered for all platforms except Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>Industry experts believe people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, and that it's just a matter of time before higher price points for games become normalized. For now, though, many companies are sticking with $70 for new games (and also offering more expensive premium editions and selling lots of DLC and microtransactions at the same time). </p><p>Mario Kart World was the first major game to jump up to $80, though it is also available within a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft planned to charge $80 for games this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">scuttled those plans.</a> For its part, EA has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-battlefield-6-coming-ea-reiterates-that-it-has-no-plans-to-charge-80-for-games/1100-6533540/" data-ref-id="1100-6533540">no plans to charge $80 for games</a>, while Rockstar owner <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">Take-Two responded to a question about GTA 6's price</a>, but didn't confirm anything.</p><p>These listings were first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1963188327881875580" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a></p><p>007 First Light is set for release in 2026 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. There have been numerous James Bond video games over the years, of course--including the iconic GoldenEye 007--but 007 First Light is the first to tell an origin story for the world-famous character.</p><p>You'll play as James Bond when he's 26 years old and in the Royal Navy, prior to becoming the British superspy everyone knows today. He gets recruited for MI6 and eventually its elite 00 section.</p><p>The State of Play today, September 3, will showcase 30 minutes of gameplay, showing off Bond taking on his first mission.

As players have discovered, gigantic Hive Lords that can give Destiny 2's Hive Worm gods a run for their money are lurking beneath the surface, and they're the <em>devil </em>to kill.</p><p>Easily one of the biggest bosses to date in Helldivers 2, Hive Lords boast an incredible amount of health and are covered in rocky scales of armor. These bullet-sponges can shrug off just about anything you can throw at them, and while they aren't unkillable, a Helldivers team is going to need to call in multiple drops of anti-tank weaponry and hellbombs to take down this skyscraper-sized titan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZ34QSm-nJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yZ34QSm-nJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fighting a Hive Lord is challenging enough, but defending yourself from one is also a Herculean labor. The massive worms can burrow underground for surprise attacks, erupting to shower the battlefield with rocks or flatten you with their sheer mass. If that wasn't bad enough, they can blanket the area in corrosive bile, forcing teams to stay on the move during these fights.</p><p>So far, the best strategy for dealing with a Hive Lord is a classic from Arthurian legend: <a href="https://youtu.be/MUG9VzHoEoc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">run away</a>. Sure, a Hive Lord has a few exposed areas under its armor and a mouth that an anti-tank rocket can comfortably fit inside of, but the best course of action here is to strategically retreat and carry on with your regular mission objectives.</p><p>Hive Lords require an absurd amount of resources to take down--<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1n6m0vo/they_are_real_and_we_killed_one_raaaahhhh/" rel="nofollow ">one team says it used 10 Hellbombs, eight 500KG bombs, and several stratagems to get the job done</a>--and so far it looks like there's no reward for killing one, other than the sweet feeling of protecting democracy for another day from the monster.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

This original game blends survival horror with sci-fi, taking place in an alternate history Poland in the 1960s, under Soviet control. You explore the destroyed and life-less city, looking for jump points to find people in the past who could help prevent disaster.</p><p dir="ltr">For tips and guides on the toughest parts of Cronos: The New Dawn check out our guide on the optional <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-solve-the-hospital-chapel-puzzle-in-cronos-the-new-dawn/1100-6534152/">Hospital Chapel puzzle</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Cronos: The New Dawn?</h2><p dir="ltr">Based on the completion time of three members of the GameSpot team, Cronos: The New Dawn will take you between 15 and 20 hours to complete. While there is some optional exploration and puzzle-solving to be done, the biggest swing in playtimes will come down to how difficult you find the combat to be. Cronos: The New Dawn has some tough encounters and restrictive inventory management, which could result in you getting stuck on some of the harder combat challenges.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list</h2><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn comprises four major sections rather than distinct chapter names, so there is no true Cronos: The New Dawn chapter list per se.. The location names don't contain any spoilers beyond what kind of areas you will eventually explore. Between these areas, you will often travel back to a hubspace inside a defunct tram station, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Cronos: The New Dawn sections:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Apartments</li><li dir="ltr">Steelworks</li><li dir="ltr">Hospital</li><li dir="ltr">Church Abbey</li></ul>

                <p>The Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app gets a little bit bigger tomorrow, as the House of Mario revealed that the classic shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forsaken-1998/" data-ref-id="5000-103">Forsaken 64</a> will be making its way to the app on September 4. As always, this is only for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers, and you'll need to have the Mature version of the Nintendo 64 app downloaded in order to play it. Forsaken 64 is actually only the fifth game to release on the Mature app, joining other classics like Perfect Dark and Turok: Dinosaur Hunter.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who might be on the younger side, Forsaken 64 is a shooter that first released way back in 1998 on the original Nintendo 64, as well as PlayStation and PC. It's set in the still-far-off year of 2113, where all life on Earth has been wiped out following a science experiment that caused a shockwave to hit the entire planet. The N64 version is actually unique compared to the PlayStation and PC versions--in the latter two, you play as someone trying to obtain some lost treasure, whereas in the former you play as a character trying to thwart said thieves by taking them down.</p><p dir="ltr">A big thing that sets the game apart from that era of shooters is its movement--the game has a full six degrees of freedom, meaning you can move backwards and forwards, side to side, up and down, and combinations of all of those too. You'll also be able to play in multiplayer with up to four players at once like in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">Forsaken 64 releases on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 through the Nintendo 64 - Nintendo Classics: Mature app on September 4.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Former PlayStation exclusive game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">opened up the floodgates to Xbox Series X|S users</a>. And while Helldivers 2 remains immensely popular, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani has indicated that his team has had trouble adjusting the game because the majority of players aren't offering any feedback about it.</p><p>"The vast, vast majority silently play the game--they don't post here or on Reddit," wrote Joriani on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1411450096058368114" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-studio-ceo-says-the-vast-majority-of-people-silently-play-the-shooter-which-means-the-devs-cant-just-look-at-reddit-and-what-streamers-are-saying-for-feedback-this-is-a-challenge-for-all-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "When we do good, we [see] this in the stats. And when we don't, we also see it--sometimes it overlaps with what influencers or people say in social media--often it does not. So we use different tools to calibrate our compass."</p><p>Jorjani noted that the developers do listen to feedback from Helldivers 2 players who stream their games. However, he feels that they represent "the play style of a minority," while also setting "standards for many as they have a platform to broadcast and many who look." Ultimately, Joriani indicated that Arrowhead makes changes and fixes by balancing out external feedback with "a lot of data, metrics. and qualitative data."</p><p>Helldivers 2 recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/" data-ref-id="1100-6534312">surged past 500,000 concurrent players</a>, which is apparently attributed to the influx of Xbox gamers. To mark the game's crossover era, Arrowhead added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-mysterious-helldivers-2-signal-sure-sounds-like-halo-odsts-superintendent/1100-6533911/" data-ref-id="1100-6533911">Halo's ODST MA5C Assault Rifle</a> as part of a collaboration with Microsoft.
