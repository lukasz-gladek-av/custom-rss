                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--<strong>Season 3 starts on March 25</strong>, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.</p><p dir="ltr">With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_teaser">Fortnite OG Season 3 teaser</h2><p>Epic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHdzbgTMbcX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser</a> are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Pass_Season_3">Fortnite OG Pass Season 3</h2><p>The first two OG passes have included three new skins that are remixes of existing skins that first appeared during the original seasons. Each pass had two remixes of old pass skins and one remix of a shop skin, though it should be noted that they had to do it that way for those seasons because they didn't have many skins--the Season 1 shop only had two, and the Season 2 battle pass only had three knights and Sparkle Specialist.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354" data-ratio="0.55826771653543" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354"></a><figcaption>The original Season 3 pass, pictured here, will heavily inspire the OG Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 3 battle pass, by contrast, had six skins--Rust Lord, Elite Agent, The Reaper (Fortnite-brand John Wick), and three astronauts. They could make three distinct skins from that group, but on the shop side of things, Season 3 did introduce Raven--and Epic loves doing new versions of Raven almost as much as it likes doing new versions of Midas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_map">Fortnite OG Season 3 map</h2><p dir="ltr">Not much changed between Season 2 and 3, as you can see--the Season 3 map is almost identical to the Season 2 island that's on the way out. But that teaser including the meteor could be hinting that we'll start in the middle. As the end of the season approached, and the meteor came along with it, small pieces of the meteor kept falling off and damaging the island every match, and that's exactly the sort of shakeup feature that the OG mode could use. Since Epic has typically not done many in-season map changes in the OG mode, would anybody be upset if they jumped straight to that part?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352" data-ratio="1" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG's presumed Season 3 map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_loot_pool">Fortnite OG Season 3 loot pool</h2><p dir="ltr">Most of the current OG loot pool will stick around for Season 3, but this season introduced a variety of interesting new weapons and gadgets that you will very likely see in the new OG season.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hand cannon</li><li dir="ltr">Crossbow</li><li dir="ltr">Guided missile</li><li dir="ltr">Egg launcher</li><li dir="ltr">Port-a-fort</li><li dir="ltr">Remote explosives</li><li dir="ltr">Clingers</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a>, the first real attempt ever to compete with The Sims in the life sim space, is here, releasing via Steam Early Access, and it's only natural that players will spend their first several hours in the game creating their characters and messing around in build mode to see what kinds of dollhouses they can assemble. There's no point in jumping into the simulation until you've got everything else in order.</p><p>For those Sims players who are eager to see what InZoi's got that The Sims doesn't, be warned that InZoi's build mode has a few big quirks that you'll need to learn about before you get started, or else you might accidentally rip the walls out of your house while you're trying to make it bigger. Fortunately, we've got you covered with our InZoi build mode guide.</p><h2>How InZoi's home-building gameplay differs from the Sims</h2><p>If you're coming to InZoi from The Sims 4, you'll probably be used to a build mode in which everything is one context-sensitive click away. Clicking on an object picks it up; clicking on a wall lets you move it to expand or contract the room it's containing. You just click on what you want to manipulate, and then you manipulate it. InZoi's build mode is slightly more complicated than that, thanks largely to the fact that it has more customization options--but there are some fundamental differences from The Sims that will probably trip you up at first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269"></a><figcaption>InZoi's build mode will be familiar to Sims fans, but it has several unique aspects to it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><span>The first of these big differences is that you need to choose the right selection mode. By default, your cursor is using the standard "</span><strong>Selection Tool</strong><span>," which lets you click on and manipulate individual objects, like your couch. When you're in the mode, moving a wall will move </span><em>only</em><span> the wall--the room the wall belonged to won't change aside from no longer having a wall. If you want to change the size of a room, or make your house bigger, you'll instead need to choose the </span><strong>Room Selection Tool</strong><span>, which you can find on the build mode options bar near the top of the UI, immediately to the right of the standard Selection Tool.</span></h3><p dir="ltr">It's in that part of Build Mode--the part where you're dealing with furniture, appliances, and anything else you might put in your house--where you'll find another quirk you'll need to remember. In InZoi, you can customize your furniture just as deeply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-custom-clothes-and-furniture-in-inzoi/1100-6530233/" data-ref-id="1100-6530233">you can customize your clothing</a>, but you can only do so <em>after</em> you have placed the item in question. So you would, say, pick a couch you like from the build menu, place it in your home, and click on it to bring up the option to customize it--then you'll be presented with a pile of options for texture and color, and you can upload your own texture images yourself if you want, or use InZoi's built-in AI image generator to make one. If you want all your furniture to be covered in pictures of your dog, you can do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268"></a><figcaption>You'd better get used to swapping between the Selection Tool and the Room Selection Tool, because you're going to do it a lot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This after-the-fact customization causes no issues for things like your refrigerator, but since everything you can place in build mode works the same way, there are certain things where this becomes a problem. For example, if you want to add a staircase that turns 180 degrees halfway up, you'll have to place a full straight flight of stairs first and then bend it afterward. Since the purpose of such a staircase is to save on the horizontal space that the staircase takes up, having it work this way defeats that purpose because you have to make room for the full normal staircase anyway. You'll have to exercise a bit of cleverness to deal with this issue when it arises.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you understand these two basic aspects, most builders will be ready to go in InZoi; build mode is otherwise largely similar to that of The Sims but with a redesigned UI. But we'd be remiss if we forgot to point out one other strange thing about InZoi's build mode that has no equivalent in The Sims.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270"></a><figcaption>The ersatz apartment building where my Zois live</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I set up my first Zoi family, I put them in what looks like the first floor of a small apartment building in Dowon, which you can see above--it has a communal space with a gym on the ground floor, with three floors of living space above it. My family lived on the first of those floors, but I soon realized that I had no neighbors, and there was no access point for the upper two floors.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole building belonged to my family, and I just had to build new staircases to get up there--I had three times more space to work with than I'd thought, and my small apartment turned into a large house in minutes. It was a pretty surprising development since this is not how a building like this works in real life, and the game had made no attempt to tell me that I could do that. This is something to keep in mind when you start feeling like your family needs more space--you might already have it.</p><p dir="ltr">InZoi launches in Early Access on Steam on March 27 for $40. Until the game officially launches, players can download the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-an-inzoi-creative-studio-key-for-the-demo/1100-6530268/" data-ref-id="1100-6530268">InZoi Creative Studio</a> for free. Through the 22nd, you'll unlock access by watching InZoi streams on Twitch or the game's Steam store page. Starting on the 23rd, the Creative Studio will be available to download on Steam without requiring any tasks.</p>

                <p>Netflix was working on a AAA multiplayer shooter with a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">the game and the studio were scuttled</a> in 2024. Why? One of Netflix's top gaming bosses, Alain Tascan, said in an interview that this project did not align with the company's goals.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-21/netflix-bets-big-on-video-games-with-broad-new-strategy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tascan told Bloomberg</a>. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p><p>The shift away from this game came amid a wider shakeup at at Netflix's film and TV divisions that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-kind-of-movies-netflix-wants-to-focus-on-going-forward/1100-6522677/" data-ref-id="1100-6522677">calls for fewer, less-expensive releases that aim for higher quality.</a> </p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>Just this week, <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/spry-foxs-spirit-crossing-comes-to-netflix-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Spry Fox announced Spirit Crossing for Netflix</a>, while Shenmue designer Yu Suzuki's new game <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/steel-paws-mobile-game-news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steel Paws</a> was released in February. </p>
