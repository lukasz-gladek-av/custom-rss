                <p>After being glimpsed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2 reveal</a>, Nintendo formally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart 9</a> during this week's Switch 2 Direct livestream--the game is officially called Mario Kart World. This new look at the kart-racing game showed off several of the familiar faces who'll be hitting the track, including everyone's favorite plumber Mario, several members of the Mushroom Kingdom, and other racers like Donkey Kong.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo will share more details on Mario Kart World during a special Nintendo Direct on April 17.</p><p>Mario Kart World looks like a major step up from Mario Kart 8. It features support for up 24 racers, which is the most in franchise history. There are also appear to be new vehicles, including jet skis and jets, while players can now grind on rails and flip across walls. Mario Kart World also includes time-of-day and weather conditions that change throughout races. Players also are also free to drive off-road "virtually everywhere," Nintendo said during the presentation.</p><p>The classic Grand Prix mode returns, along with what's called Knockout Tour. In this mode, players take part in races from one corner of the world to another with checkpoints--players are eliminated if they're last to reach certain checkpoints. There is also a Free Roam mode that allows players to basically go anywhere they want for a scenic drive and to take photos with friends on the road.</p><p>Mario Kart 9 has some big boots to fill, as it's a sequel to one of the best-selling Nintendo games of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. As of December 31, 2024, Mario Kart 8 has sold 67 million units on Switch and it has a significant lead on other top-selling games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons (47.44 million units sold), Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (35.88 million units sold), and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (32.62 million units sold).</p>

                <p>2024 was a brutal year for the video game industry, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">thousands of jobs lost due to massive layoffs</a>. So far, that trend has continued in 2025 with recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/" data-ref-id="1100-6530502">layoffs at Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">Striking Distance Studios</a>. Now, Shams Jorjani--the CEO of Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios--is speaking out about the mass layoffs and calling for accountability from the CEOs who make those decisions.</p><p>"I wish that our industry hadn't shed almostâ€¦ 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," said Jorjani during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries? What's happening is that regular developers are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry."</p><p>Jorjani went on to explain that he isn't against seeing studios expand, but he argues that growth should be responsibly paced for the long-term health of the business and the employees who work there. He added that his "first priority is to make sure that people [at Arrowhead] have jobs for many years." During the same interview, Jorjani noted that the turnaround of Helldivers 2 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devsceo-was-inspired-by-no-mans-sky-turnaround/1100-6530533/" data-ref-id="1100-6530533">inspired by No Man's Sky's comeback story</a>.</p><p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-discusses-gaming-industrys-mass-layoffs-and-what-caused-them/1100-6530246/" data-ref-id="1100-6530246">recently made similar remarks</a> about layoffs and suggested that the video game industry would be in a more sustainable place if companies were making several different types of games rather than a constant cycle of new battle-royale titles.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, the massive gaming platform that mostly caters to younger gamers, has announced the launch of "Rewarded Video" ads, an ad format that allows users to opt in to watching ads in exchange for in-game rewards or currency.</p><p>This style of advertising is already common in mobile gaming and other mobile apps with microtransactions, where watching an ad is often offered as an alternative to paying premium currencies. Now, this feature is coming to Roblox--and by extension, to the millions of user-created "experiences" hosted on it platforms.</p><p>These ads will appear as an opt-in choice for users, who can choose to watch an ad up to 30 seconds in length to get a certain reward. In an example shared on <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/roblox-scales-video-ads-partners-with-google" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox's corporate blog</a>, players can choose to purchase a house with in-game currency, or to rent it for a single session for free by watching an ad.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4469196-robloxad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469196" data-ratio="0.56225425950197" data-width="1526" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4469196-robloxad.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469196"></a><figcaption>An example of an ad notification</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4469196-robloxad.jpg"></figure><p>It's unclear how much it is or where this feature will turn up in Roblox's most popular games (officially known as "experiences"), with Roblox simply acting as the middleman between Roblox content creators--referred to in this system as ad publishers--and the advertisers themselves.</p><p>The company boasts that the new Rewarded Video ads show higher engagement than regular advertising, with a completion rate between 80-90%. Roblox says users who trialled the system "saw the value" in watching ads for rewards such as power-ups or in-game currency.</p><p>Roblox says its advertising platform has the potential to reach tens of millions of daily active Gen Z users, quoting one of its marketing partners who calls Roblox "the go-to platform for Gen Z connections." Roblox's popularity with the younger generation doesn't go unnoticed by major brands, with many creating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ikea-is-hiring-and-paying-workers-for-its-virtual-roblox-store/1100-6523923/" data-ref-id="1100-6523923">bespoke</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-partnering-with-the-us-olympics-for-a-new-in-game-experience/1100-6525193/" data-ref-id="1100-6525193">experiences</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-buy-movie-tickets-in-a-video-game/1100-6525593/" data-ref-id="1100-6525593">activations</a> on the platform to reach younger gamers.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Borderline Justice Warbond Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"We went down to like 30 [percent positive] in [Steam's] user score, and usually that's the death knell for a game, but we came back from that," he recounted. "Then we fumbled with balancing and the focus for the game, and that sent us all the way down to 19%, I think was the lowest. Games that get 19% user score do not generally recover."</p><p>To make matters worse, the 19% user score happened while the majority of the Swedish studio was off on summer break, something Jorjani says is taken very seriously in Sweden. The CEO had to have an awkward conversation with the head of Sony, explaining that Helldivers 2 could recover, but they couldn't act on it straight away.</p><p>"We issued a 60-day plan that put us back on track, and we did an update, and an update, and an update," Jorjani said of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-director-outlines-plan-to-fix-the-game/1100-6525789/" data-ref-id="1100-6525789">recovery plans</a>. "I was very much inspired by No Man's Sky and the team over there, that had a similar kind of journey: very hyped, and then bombed, and then they put their head to the grindstone and just updated the game."</p><p>No Man's Sky has become emblematic of the power of post-launch updates, spending years creating an in-depth and beloved game after a notoriously rocky launch. No Man's Sky's turnaround happened over many years--only just reaching a "Very Positive" rating on Steam for the first time last November. While Helldivers 2 may have followed in its footsteps, it's taken a far shorter time to turn opinions around.</p><p>"Since September we've been on a very good trajectory," Jorjani said. "We went from 19% to 94% positive on Steam."</p><p>The studio's commitment to continued updates and addressing player feedback has earned it a loyal player base, allowing Helldivers 2 to stand comfortably in a gaming landscape with a glut of live-service titles to vie for players' attention. The game's popularity has even seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-movies-are-officially-in-development/1100-6528663/" data-ref-id="1100-6528663">Helldivers feature film</a> announced, which is in development now with Sony's film division.</p>
