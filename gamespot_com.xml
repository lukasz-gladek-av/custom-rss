                <p><span>Hitting is one of the most frustrating yet rewarding experiences in all of </span><a href="///">MLB The Show 25</a><span>.</span> One moment, you're sending balls into the stands; the next, you can't seem to hit a single pitch coming your way. While you can go through slumps, just like MLB players do in real life, your struggles with hitting could come down to something as simple as your settings.</p><p>In MLB The Show 25, the ideal hitting style uses the "Zone" Hitting Interface. This interface allows you to more accurately get the barrel of your bat on the ball. The Zone interface is also the only option that allows for the use of PCI, or Plate Control Indicator. PCI is an entirely different ballgame in the settings menu, and going through the various options can get confusing.</p><p>To ensure you have the best chance to hit in MLB The Show 25, check out the guide to see the top PCI settings.</p><h2>Best PCI Settings in MLB The Show 25</h2><p>You can change your PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 by going to the settings menu, selecting "Gameplay," and then scrolling down the "Hitting" section of the settings. As previously mentioned, you can only use PCI settings if you have the Zone Hitting Interface selected. If you have the other two options, Timing or Directional, all of the PCI settings will be locked.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461524"></a><figcaption>The hitting menu in MLB The Show 25</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461524-img_6470.jpg"></figure><p>The PCI settings encompass a few different areas. You have how the PCI is set up when certain pitchers are on the mound, how the PCI looks at the plate, and whether you can see the PCI icon or not. There are over a dozen PCI-specific settings in the hitting menu, and the game doesn't do a terrific job of explaining what each one does.</p><p>Fortunately, you can view the list below to see every PCI setting laid out and what we recommend for every option:</p><ul><li><strong>PCI Anchor</strong>: This determines if the PCI icon appears in a specific spot depending on what type of pitcher is on the mound. It's usually better to have this off if you want to have full control over the PCI, but you can also enable it if you're just learning how to hit.</li><li><strong>RHP vs RHH, RHP vs. LHH, LHP vs. RHH, RHP vs. RHH</strong>: These can only be changed if you have enabled the PCI Anchor. If you have the anchor enabled, you can choose where the PCI Anchor is parked when each pitcher/hitter scenario arises.</li><li><strong>Free Anchor Reset</strong>: Batter</li><li><strong>PCI Anchor Dots</strong>: On if you are using the PCI Anchor</li><li><strong>Plate Coverage Indicator</strong>: This setting determines whether the PCI icon appears in the strikezone when you're up to bat. Generally, most players want this enabled, as it can get difficult to know where you're swinging without seeing the indicator.</li><li><strong>PCI Center</strong>: Diamonds. This has been the PCI meta for years, as Diamonds don't take up too much room but they're easy to see</li><li><strong>PCI Inner</strong>: Starfighter. This is more preference, but Starfighter is the best all-around option. You can use Basic if you're just learning how to use PCI.</li><li><strong>PCI Outer</strong>: None. This helps to reduce the size of the PCI icon and gets rid of some extra distraction that you really don't need.</li><li><strong>PCI Color</strong>: A bright color that you can see easily. Most players use the standard Yellow color, but you can also use Red or something else. You could go the other way as well and use Black, but that can get lost in the background of a field sometimes.</li><li><strong>PCI Opacity</strong>: 80%. This increases or reduces how transparent the PCI icon is. You want it mostly visible but still a little see-through so it doesn't become too distracting on the screen.</li><li><strong>PCI Fadeout</strong>: None. This either makes it so the PCI icon fades before a pitch is delivered or it stays on the screen until you swing the bat. This is mostly personal preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461525"></a><figcaption>The preferred PCI settings</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461525-img_6469.jpg"></figure><p>Those are some baseline PCI settings in MLB The Show 25 that can work for new and veteran players alike. It's also recommended to head into a practice mode and try out different settings so you have a better idea of what you prefer.</p><p>Some MLB The Show players like the Bat PCI Center, as it allows them to visualize swinging a pitch better. However, others prefer no center and just like a couple of dots on their screen so they can focus more on the pitch. The PCI color is also completely up to you, as everyone has a different eyesight.</p><p>If you're just looking for some basic PCI settings that you can set and never touch again, you have them. However, this is also just a foundation, as you can fiddle with the individual settings more and more as you continue to use the PCI system in MLB The Show 25.</p>

Prior to this part, you have to meet with various NPCs and learn about the proper manners when participating in a tea ceremony. You can read about all the steps in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-imai-sokyu-tea-merchant-kosode/1100-6530221/" data-ref-id="1100-6530221"><strong>Searching Sakai: Tea merchant and kosode guide</strong></a>.</p><p>Once you're done with the preliminary tasks and the tea ceremony has been concluded, Naoe realizes that one of the ladies in the gathering is also the Golden Teppo mercenary. You're then given a choice on which person to confront: Otama or Wakasa.</p><h3 id="What_happens_if_you_confront_Wakasa_">What happens if you confront Wakasa?</h3><p>If you decide to confront Wakasa in Assassin's Creed Shadows, then congratulations are in order, because you've made the right choice. Wakasa admits that she's encountered Naoe before--to be more specific, she shot her in the kidney and left her for dead. She really is the Golden Teppo, and she leaves you with a stern warning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462021" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462021"></a><figcaption>Yes, confronting Wakasa is the correct decision.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462021-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="What_happens_if_you_confront_Otama_">What happens if you confront Otama?</h3><p>If you choose to confront Otama, well, then that's quite a bummer indeed. Even though Otama is a mean lady, she's not the actual mercenary that you're looking for. This decision causes her to run away, and you have to give chase and take her down. You're then left with a note saying that she's still a corrupt person, though Naoe learns that Wakasa is the true culprit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4462022"></a><figcaption>Otama might not be a very nice person, but she's not your quarry either.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4462022-assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-wakasa-golden-teppo-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="Taking_out_the_Golden_Teppo">Taking out the Golden Teppo</h3><p>Regardless of your decision on confronting either Otama or Wakasa in Assassin's Creed Shadows, you do get to face the Golden Teppo (Wakasa) once you're ready.
