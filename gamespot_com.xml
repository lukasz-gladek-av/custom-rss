Some of your tea requests are fairly straightforward, but others are a bit harder to complete. Here, we'll guide you through all the recipes needed to complete your customer requests and advance the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Here we list all the customers and their tea requests in the order you'll encounter them, breaking the game into chapters. There are five chapters total.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>While it's not required to complete the game in any way, I highly recommend having Alta drink a cup of each recipe brewed. You get a unique bit of story or commentary with each recipe she drinks.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Chapter_1_tea_requests">Chapter 1 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Hunter">Demon Hunter</a></li><li><a href="#Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Hunter_">Demon Hunter:</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_2_tea_requests">Chapter 2 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li><li><a href="#Crafty_customer">Crafty customer</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Bat_customer">Bat customer</a></li><li><a href="#Bat_customer">Bat customer</a></li><li><a href="#Ren">Ren</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_3_tea_requests">Chapter 3 tea requests</a></li><li><a href="#Chapter_4_tea_requests">Chapter 4 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Bird">Bird</a></li><li><a href="#Jerry">Jerry</a></li><li><a href="#Terry">Terry</a></li><li><a href="#Larry">Larry</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Harry">Harry</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li><li><a href="#Garry">Garry</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Chapter_5_tea_requests">Chapter 5 tea requests</a><ul><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li><li><a href="#Boro">Boro</a></li><li><a href="#Nana">Nana</a></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li><li><a href="#Fairy">Fairy</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Monster">Monster</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1_tea_requests">Chapter 1 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458334" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458334"></a><figcaption>Alta and Boro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458334-altaandboro.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Gerald__the_knight_">Gerald (the knight)</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Something to wake him up</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball and an Azzy Fruit.

The Chip Chip is grown with a blue seed surrounded by three other blue seeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing the above tea requests will prompt Boro to talk to you about the shrine. Interacting with the shrine will advance you to Chapter 2, so if you're still planting or enjoying your time here, you can choose to wait and visit the shrine later. <strong>Interacting with the shrine will reset all of your farming</strong> and rearrange the garden a bit.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2_tea_requests">Chapter 2 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458337" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458337"></a><figcaption>Bat customer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458337-batcustomer.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Boro asks you to add plants to his hanging flower pots. This is a pretty easy task. Just grab an empty pot from the shop and then transfer plants into the hanging pots.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Bring any item to trade for something of Nana's.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't a tea request, but you'll need to trade an item with Nana. This can be anything from a cup, a seed, or a trinket you found. You can return to her two more times to trade and receive items.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A fruit flavor that brings to mind "passion"</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This feels misleading, because all of the fruit ingredients list various effects in your field guide, but nothing mentions being related to passion in any way. This request seems to refer to your own passion, and you can brew a tea with any fruit to appease Ren.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crafty_customer">Crafty customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Something that helps with chest pain</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Snok Cone and a Pellmelon.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Silver Moonlight Tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a Messberry, Chip Chip, Pellmelon, and any type of mushroom.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Take five photos and hang them up around the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This is another easy task. Boro will instruct you to use his camera to take pictures around the shop. You need to take five and place them in the blank photo frames hanging inside the shop.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bat_customer">Bat customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Book tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with a book. You find various books as trinkets while tending the tea shop. Sometimes, they are gifts in the mailbox, found while sweeping leaf piles, or given to you by guests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bat_customer">Bat customer</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Miracle Pomme</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with Miracle Pomme fruit. At Boro's suggestion, you can add two additional fruits for color. This isn't a requirement, but it may give you different dialogue results.</p><p dir="ltr">To get Miracle Pomme fruit, you'll first need to breed the Weyling Tree with three Hue Shrooms. Watering this new plant will give you a color-swapped Weyling Tree that produces the Miracle Pomme fruit.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ren">Ren</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request </strong>- Any</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Any</p><p dir="ltr">If this objective isn't available to you, and all other quests are complete, try brewing yourself a cup of tea and drinking it. Not sure if this is a glitch, but I seemed stuck and unable to progress until I drank tea. Then, Ren reappeared for his final interaction before I was able to use the shrine again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3_tea_requests">Chapter 3 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458335" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458335"></a><figcaption>View of the Wanderstop shrine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458335-theshrine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a brief story beat, you'll return to the tea shop. This section doesn't have any tea requests, but you will need to speak with Boro and the mysterious cloud-riding customer who shows up.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, you'll get a prompt to return to the shrine.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4_tea_requests">Chapter 4 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458338-brewing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458338" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458338-brewing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458338"></a><figcaption>Alta brewing tea</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458338-brewing.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a brief narration, you'll return to the tea shop with new seeds to plant and recipes to learn.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bird">Bird</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Lavender tea with Ghost Fruit and color-swapped Ghost Fruit</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew tea using a Tea Ball combined with Waypur Sprout (lavender) and both a Ghost Fruit and a color-swapped Ghost Fruit.</p><p dir="ltr">To color-swap, you'll need to plant three Hue Shrooms around the Ghost Rose plant that produces the Ghost Fruit.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Jerry">Jerry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Coffee. Jerry insists on Coffee</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee. This is just boiling water and coffee.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The coffee requests can't be completed until you first finish Zenith's initial tea request</strong>. So, don't stress if you took the orders for the coffee guys first, but you'll need to speak with Zenith to progress.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terry">Terry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Coffee with a fruit containing as little flavor as possible</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Biteberry.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Larry">Larry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Cold coffee.</p><p dir="ltr">Recipe: This is just coffee and water without boiling it.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea made with something of value</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>Brew tea with any other ingredient. Can be a fruit or a trinket.</p><p dir="ltr">Zenith will then provide you with coffee bean plants to complete the coffee requests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Feed a cup of tea to five Pluffins</p><p dir="ltr">Again, Boro's request isn't a tea recipe, but you will need to offer tea to the Pluffin birds found all around the shop. Just place cups of tea near five different Pluffins.</p><p dir="ltr">This can be any tea recipe, but I'd <strong>recommend something like the Painted Gourd</strong> fruit to change the birds to an orange color. The mint tea made it hard to tell which birds I'd already given the tea to.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Harry">Harry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Mintiatto coffee. Tastes like mint and ice cream.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee with a Chip Chip and Painted Gourd.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Zenith">Zenith</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> A tea made from a fruit, the plant the fruit came from, and a seed used to grow the plant.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This can be any one fruit of your choosing. However, you also need the plant and the seed associated with that specific fruit. In order to include the plant itself into the mix, you'll first need to take the plant and surround it with three of the blue Shrink Shrooms. Grab a pot and place the shrunken plant into the pot. Then, brew the tea with the fruit, the potted plant, and the seed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Garry">Garry</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Coffee</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Pick a coffee bean from a plant, run the bean through the dishwasher, and then brew coffee. This is just regular coffee with boiling water.</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, you'll complete some narrative and return to the shrine for the final chapter.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_5_tea_requests">Chapter 5 tea requests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458339" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458339"></a><figcaption>Alta sitting on the bench</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4458339-altasittingonthebench.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is your last chapter in the Wanderstop shop. You'll learn a few more recipes, and you'll receive some of your most complex orders yet.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request -</strong> Nana's asking for some strong brew, and she's asking for a complex order that would make any barista angry.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe: </strong>This needs to be done in two separate parts.</p><p dir="ltr">For this first step, you need to boil water and use two clean coffee beans. Pour all of the coffee into the cup. Then, leave this cup sitting.</p><p dir="ltr">For the second brew, you don't want to boil the water. Instead, get the color of the bar to yellow. Then, add the Weyling Fruit, a Sweet Meelium, and a clean coffee bean. Pour this second brew on top of the original cup of coffee you made.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Gross tea</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> This can be anything. I even added a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Boro">Boro</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Boro wants you to add plants to all the large pots inside the shop. This is easy. You can re-pot some of the plants from outside, use your extra seeds, or even the coffee beans.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Nana">Nana</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Request - </strong>Nana wants stronger and even more complicated coffee with hints of cinnamon.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Again, this is a two-part process for Nana.</p><p dir="ltr">First brew, brew three clean coffee beans with hot water. Pour all of it into a cup. Leave the cup sitting there.</p><p dir="ltr">Second brew, you need to use warm water (only get the temperature to yellow) and add Weyling Fruit, a Pellmelon for the cinnamon, and a clean coffee bean. Pour this second brew on top of the original cup of coffee you made.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request - </strong>Tea that tastes like breakfast cereal, sugar, and dirt.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone (for cereal flavor), a Whistleberry (for sugar) and a dirty coffee bean.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fairy">Fairy</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea request -</strong> Aeon Brew</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> The fairy is now making Nana's orders look easy. <strong>The order of ingredients and time on this one are very specific</strong>. Have a timer ready.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a cold brew, so make sure you don't heat the water at all. You need to add a Dupe Shroom, a Waypur Sprout, a color-swapped Puffpod, a Blue Loop, a Tea Ball, and then<strong> let the ingredients sit one minute</strong> before adding a second Tea Ball as the final ingredient.</p><p dir="ltr">Remember, to color-swap the Puffpod you'll need to add three Hue Shrooms around the plant.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Monster">Monster</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tea Request - </strong>Breakfast cereal and sugar</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Recipe:</strong> Brew a Tea Ball with a Snok Cone and Whistleberry.</p><p dir="ltr">All the trophies/achievements are tied to the story, so by working through all the chapter requests, you should now have all of Wanderstop's achievements/trophies.</p>

                <p>The MMO Defiance, which was shut down in 2021, is coming back to life. For anyone unaware, Defiance was a third-person shooter MMO from Trion Worlds that was developed as a tie-in for the Syfy show of the same name, with events and storylines running across the game and the TV show. It launched in 2013 as a paid game for PC, PS3, and Xbox 360, before adopting a free-to-play model and continued to receive updates even after the TV show was canceled in 2015. A new version of the game, Defiance 2050, came out in 2018--but both games shut down servers in 2021. Now, Defiance is attempting a comeback.</p><p>Fawkes, a game company whose mission is "breathing life to old worlds and preserving their legacy," has announced plans to bring Defiance back following a deal with previous rights-owner Gamigo.</p><p>"Even though the TV series was discontinued in 2015 and Gamigo eventually closed the game in 2021, the memories of epic Arkfalls and immersive, post‑apocalyptic battles live on in your hearts," Fawkes said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1Jfk8Pt8B4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p1Jfk8Pt8B4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fawkes said it has acquired the license to the "worldwide development and publishing rights" for Defiance and Defiance 2050 on all platforms. The first step in the comeback is relaunching the original game on PC in April 2025.</p><p>"Our relaunch is designed to be a homecoming for those who once fought side by side during legendary Arkfalls. We want you to return to a familiar world that still holds countless memories, and to create new ones with friends both old and new," Fawkes said.</p><p>Should the re-launch go well in April 2025 on PC, Fawkes said it will "explore the possibility" of bringing Defiance back to consoles.</p><p>"We will start small, with a very clean state of the game, with the design and drop we understood you like, and grow from there together with you, bringing the changes that had an impact and leaving behind the ones that didn’t. We are ready to re-build Defiance together with you, Arkhunters," Fawkes said.</p><p>Fans can join the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/fawkes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fawkes Discord</a> channel to stay up to date on the newest developments.</p><p>"Thank you for keeping the flame of Defiance alive all these years. We can't wait to welcome you back into the world of epic battles and unforgettable moments. Get ready to Defy the odds once again!" Fawkes said.</p><p>Fawkes also helped revive the games Shaiya and Last Chaos, and also has the rights to Desert Operations and Wargame 1942.</p>

                <p>Lenovo might not be the first place you’d expect to find DualSense Controllers on sale, but it’s currently the best place to buy models in the Deep Earth lineup. Head over to the retailer and use promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> to get the <a href="https://howl.link/kah0afkv6gzak?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964641119?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Volcanic Red</a>, <a href="https://howl.link/4rdw54vgl4q2s?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417963320617?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sterling Silver</a>, or <a href="https://howl.link/c4hsbc2qatcx0?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17417964545581?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cobalt Blue</a> DualSense for PS5 and PC for just $54 (was $80). That makes them <strong>slightly more affordable than they were during Black Friday</strong>--so if you missed out on those deals and need an extra DualSense or two, now's a great time to pick up one of PlayStation's coolest models.</p><p>While Lenovo is advertising the promo code GAMEON, that one has actually inspired. But using promo code <strong>PLAY5</strong> will still let you snag these premium designs for cheap, so make sure to apply the code before finalizing your purchase.</p><p>The Deep Earth lineup might look more premium than the average DualSense, but these are still just your standard DualSense controllers. That means you won’t get the customization features found on the Edge. They still benefit from a built-in microphone, adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a rechargeable battery, making them the ideal choice for most gamers.</p><p>The standard DualSense, unsurprisingly, earned the top spot on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-controller/1100-6494188/" data-ref-id="1100-6494188">best PS5 controllers</a>. Check out all three Deep Earth DualSense Controllers below, and read on for details on new and upcoming limited-edition PlayStation 5 controllers.</p><p>It's worth noting that multiple limited-edition DualSense controllers are still available, including the Fortnite and Helldivers 2 models.

                <p>Paradox Interactive has launched its Chapter 4 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3486700/Crusader_Kings_III_Chapter_IV/?curator_clanid=36033026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expansion pass for Crusader Kings 3 on PC</a>, the core content being the new Genghis Khan-inspired Khans of the Steppe expansion. The pass also includes other expansions as well, such as Crowns of the World, Coronations, and All Under Heaven, and is currently being sold for $44.</p><p>The Khans of the Steppe expansion is focused on Nomadic life and the rise of the Great Khan. In it, players will be able to manage their herds, migrate across regions, and establish dominance in the Great Steppe. The expansion will also let players learn more about Mongolian history, cultural events, and traditions. Khans of the Steppe is scheduled to release on April 28 and will cost $20 if purchased separately.</p><p>While Khans of the Steppe isn't available until next month, those who purchase the expansion pass can receive the Crowns of the World update immediately. It's a cosmetic-based update that gives players six crowns, four hairstyles, and two beards to customize their rulers further.</p><p>The Coronations event pack will launch sometime between July and September. It includes a new activity called Coronations, which lets players legitimize their rule through grand ceremonies. The All Under Heaven expansion will launch sometime between October and December and will expand the game's current map by 30%, as well as allow players to explore Eastern Asia with three new regions: China, Japan, and Southeast Asia.</p><p>Despite Crusader Kings 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crusader-kings-iii-is-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-on-march-29/1100-6499972/">console versions releasing back in 2022</a>, the expansion pass is only available for PC. It's currently unknown when this expansion pass will go to other platforms.</p>
