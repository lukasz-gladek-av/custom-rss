                <p>The newest update for the viral Steam game Escape from Duckov is out now, and it discourages players from eating poop.</p><p>Up until now, players of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-a-parody-of-tarkov-featuring-ducks-is-putting-up-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535556/" data-ref-id="1100-6535556">made by five people that has sold more than 1 million copies</a> could eat poop to restore energy and hydration values. Players can still do that after the new update, but it's less effective to do so. The patch notes state:</p><p>"Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewmV79zP5XQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ewmV79zP5XQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/after-making-1-million-sales-escape-from-duckov-makes-eating-s-worse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As PC Gamer points out</a>, some players resorted to downing dookie to revitalize their character. The fecal matter is found on the map and can be eaten to restore some energy and hydration levels, at the cost of somewhat poisoning yourself. Apparently this proved to be too successful a tactic, and developer Team Soda made some changes. Players can still craft poop to create a throwable weapon called, wait for it, a Poop Ball.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes for the Duckov October 23 update below, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020/view/503965668093200561?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as Team Soda shared on Steam. </a></p><h2><strong>Escape from Duckov October 23 patch notes</strong></h2><p><b>Updates</b></p><ul><li>Orange Headphones can now be dismantled.</li><li>Added indicator display when the player is injured.</li><li>Removed the footstep sound of dogs.</li><li>Reduced the Energy and Hydration values provided by Poop.</li><li>Added another construction site in the base to prevent players from getting stuck inside rooms.</li><li>Slightly reduced the damage of Storm Creatures.</li><li>In Motion Sickness-Friendly Mode, removed the camera movement when leaving the base.</li><li>Mad Bombers now have a chance to drop other cellar keys.</li><li>Reduced the durability consumption of Small Energy Bullets, Enhanced Small Energy Bullets, and Large Energy Bullets.</li><li>Monster: Storm? now inflicts a “Shatter” effect.</li></ul><p><b>Fixes</b></p><ul><li>Fixed lag issues caused by mining machines.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Sniper Trial quest requirements do not match its description after the last update.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the MCXspear blueprint incorrectly appeared in the Recipe Collection even when it was locked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Standard Bullet (MAG) crafting recipe used a deprecated item.</li><li>Fixed an abnormal amount of ornaments appearing in the sewers.</li><li>Fixed an issue where weapon attachments were lost when disassembling guns.</li><li>Guns with Armor Penetration will now display their Penetration Level.</li><li>We're trying to fix the issue where reloading caused ammo to become “-1.”</li></ul><p><a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1979966966447177783" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analyst Daniel Ahmad reminded people</a> that Duckov was made by a team of five people, which makes the game's success even more impressive. The game is a parody of Escape from Tarkov and published by BiliBili, a Chinese giant also behind titles like Magicraft, Core Keeper, and Warm Snow.</p><p>Duckov is available now for $15.83 USD, but the price will go up 12% to $18 USD on October 30. It's putting up massive numbers on Steam, where it's reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 250,000 concurrent players.</a> The game is also available on the Epic Games Store, but not console.</p>

                <p>Embark Studios recently wrapped up a big Server Slam test for Arc Raiders ahead of its public launch on October 30, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-server-test-put-up-some-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535545/" data-ref-id="1100-6535545">the test was <em>huge</em></a>. Given that, Embark got a lot of feedback, and the developer has now disclosed some of what's it's working on addressing ahead of release.</p><p>The developer said player feedback, along with the team's own internal data, provided "crucial insights" into how Arc Raiders can be improved for launch. Here are the key points, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as written by the developer.</a></p><ul><li><strong>Stability:</strong> You helped us quickly identify and resolve stability issues across all platforms during the test. We’ve locked in even more solutions leading up to launch day to ensure a smooth launch experience.</li><li><strong>The Flying ARCs:</strong> It turns out their awareness was a bit too high, allowing them to essentially see through trees and bushes. This made their vision unintentionally over-powered, but we’ve adjusted what they can see now, so expect a fairer fight at launch.</li><li><strong>The Dam Tower:</strong> We watched many of you bravely, and perhaps a little too easily, access the Dam Control Tower on Dam Battlegrounds. It was fun to watch, but a bit too accessible for a key loot location. That's been fixed to keep the challenge sharp.</li><li><strong>Visual Difference:</strong> Some noticed a visual difference between Server Slam and earlier tests on certain hardware. The default settings did change a bit to favor more performance, and we are looking into tuning further to strike the right balance.</li></ul><p>Additionally, Embark said feedback from the test gave the studio valuable feedback in terms of bug-fixes and game balance. "Every piece of data and feedback you provided is helping us to make <i>Arc</i> Raiders a better game," the developer said.</p><p>The studio also shared some key milestones from the test that players collectively achieved, including 30 million rounds played, 58 million Arc destroyed, and, most importantly, that players collected more than 800,000 rubber ducks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589812" data-ratio="0.55882352941176" data-width="748" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4589812"></a><figcaption>Here are some Server Slam stats.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4589812-screenshot2025-10-23at2.49.30%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>Arc Raiders launches on October 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, and it's priced at $40 USD.

The developer's latest Dev Talk video confirmed seven new multiplayer maps, three zombies maps, new weapons, seasonal events, and more for Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">This new Black Ops 7 <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> boasts that Season 1 is packed with content across multiplayer and Zombies. "This will be the biggest season we've ever done in franchise history," said senior director of production Yale Miller.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAcJLh2tE2o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAcJLh2tE2o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are seven 6v6 maps confirmed for multiplayer, and this will be a mix of new and remastered maps. The video shows a brief look at Fate, which is a brand-new map inspired by the game's campaign mission called Time and Fate. This features a trippy setting of fractured and floating building pieces from a city in Nicaragua. Other maps briefly shown are Odysseus, which is based on the campaign mission of the same name, and Utopia is a futuristic Guild facility based in Australia. For the season's remasters, Meltdown from Black Ops 2 will return in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also confirmed map changes were being made based on community feedback from the beta. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce said that the team is looking at all the doors across Black Ops 7's entire map pool to see where it can reduce automatic doors without disrupting gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">Seven weapons are coming in Season 1. Scronce confirms the fan-favorite Maddox assault rifle from Black Ops 4 is included in the lineup. A crossbow and the ballistic knife are also returning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589841"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 launch content and Season 1 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4589841-season1roadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for game modes, the return of Treyarch's crossbow and ballistic knife also means the popular Sticks and Stones party mode is packed into the Season 1 update. Prop Hunt and seasonal limited-time modes are confirmed as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies, there will be three maps. Season 1 is confirmed to have one brand-new round-based map and two survival maps based on locations from the Ashes of the Damned launch map. The update will add more augments, field upgrades, ammo mods, and other Zombies content. Players can also expect two limited-time holiday modes for Zombies on the season's new round-based map.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Black Ops 7 variant of Nuketown arrives on November 20, so players won't need to wait long after launch to start receiving more content.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's previous Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
