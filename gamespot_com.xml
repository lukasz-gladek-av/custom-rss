                <p>This month's brief ban of TikTok in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">saw Marvel Snap get caught in the crossfire</a>, as it was inaccessible to US-based players for several days. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-is-back-online-developer-is-looking-for-a-new-publisher/1100-6528902/" data-ref-id="1100-6528902">After that issue was resolved</a>, developer Second Dinner pledged to reward players for their patience, and it looks like there'll be a lot of free stuff to grab this week.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/seconddinner/article/1882941452336189902" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Second Dinner explained how this will work</a> on its social media channels. First off, there'll be separate rewards packages for US-based players and the international playerbase. Each package will be subdivided based on collection level, with the higher collection levels getting the lion's share of the goodies. These are substantial drops, as Second Dinner will be handing out currencies, variant cards, and more. This stuff typically equates to hundreds of dollars if you were to buy them in the game's expensive microtransactions store.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that the existing US-based players are defined as accounts created before January 20 inside the US and have shown any activity in the last 30 days before the outage, Second Dinner wrote. The developer explained that if US players made use of a VPN service to get around the downtime, it will not affect their eligibility for the compensation package. "This includes players from outside the US VPN-ing into the US to try and receive the US Downtime Package," Second Dinner added.</p><p>Some of these rewards also require a fair bit of grinding to unlock, so even if you aren't playing Marvel Rivals regularly, you'll want to log in and claim these prizes for when you do decide to jump in again. Here's what you can expect to receive this week if you're in the US:</p><h3>US Players Downtime Package (Over Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>2 x Spotlight Keys</li><li>5,000 Season Pass XP</li><li>4,150 credits</li><li>6,200 Collector’s Tokens</li><li>1,000 Gold</li><li>5 x Gold Conquest Ticket</li><li>3 x Infinite Conquest Ticket</li><li>4,000 Conquest Medals</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>6 x Premium Mystery Variants</li><li>1 x Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>3 x Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><h3>US Players Downtime Package (Under Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>6 x mystery Series 3 cards</li><li>5,000 Season Pass XP</li><li>7,150 credits</li><li>1,000 Gold</li><li>1 x Mystery variant</li><li>6 x Premium Mystery variants</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><p>And for players outside of the US, the downtime package might not be as generous, but it's still pretty great considering that it's a freebie:</p><h3>Global Gratitude Package (Over Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>2 x Spotlight Keys</li><li>3,000 Collector’s Tokens</li><li>1,500 Credits</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>Premium Mystery Variant card</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><h3>Global Gratitude Package (Under Collection Level 500)</h3><ul><li>6 x Mystery Series 3 cards</li><li>3,000 Credits</li><li>Mystery Variant card</li><li>Premium Mystery Variant card</li><li>Cosmic Gold Border (Super Rare)</li><li>Cosmic Red Border (Super Rare)</li><li>5 x 155 Random Booster packs</li></ul><p>This should help players to unlock a few more cards as part of Marvel Snap's Dark Avengers-themed month. While Iron Patriot can only be obtained by purchasing the $10 season pass, other unlockable cards this month include Moonstone, Bullseye, Victoria Hand, and Ares.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has once again commented on the company's strategy as it relates to launching its own first-party games on other platforms. As Spencer has been saying for a long time already, he believes Xbox is strongest and best-positioned when it launches its own games on other platforms. A game remaining exclusive to Xbox in perpetuity "doesn't work for us" going forward, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/phil-spencer-120725254" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm if Bethesda's RPG Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console for the time being. Spencer said, "No."</p><p>He added: "There is no reason for me to put a ring fence around any game and say, 'This game will not go to a place where it will find players, where it would have business success for us.'"</p><p>Spencer said what his team has found is that launching Xbox games on other platforms amounts to "better business" results for the company, which in turn allows Microsoft to invest in the kinds of games that it recently showed off at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">January Xbox Developer Direct.</a></p><p>"That's our strategy. Our strategy is to allow our games to be available [across consoles]. Game Pass is an important component of playing the games on our platform. But to keep games off of other platforms, we don't think--that's not a path for us. It doesn't work for us," he said.</p><p>"What we're doing now we think really enables us to build the best platform for the world's best games. Because the world's biggest games are available in multiple places. More and more, creators are asking us, 'How do we stay connected when our game might be playable in all these different places.' We want Xbox to be absolutely the platform that enables that," Spencer added. "We think that makes us unique. Most of the other platforms out there are 'single platform on single device.' Whether that's PC, whether that's mobile, whether it's a console. We want Xbox to be a platform that enables creators across any screen that people want to play on."</p><p>Some Xbox fans have expressed concerns about this new strategy, and particularly how it may lead to a feeling of Microsoft losing its identity. Spencer said he's heard these concerns and takes them seriously. He said Xbox's "identity will continue to evolve," which he said has always been the case since the Xbox brand was launched in 2001.</p><p>The next big Xbox title to come to PS5 is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which hits Sony's console this spring following its debut on Xbox back in December. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> will then launch in May across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC at the same time. Starfield, meanwhile, launched in September 2023 and remains exclusive on console to Xbox (it's also available on PC). </p>

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be censored in Japan due to its depiction of gore and has received a mature rating from the country's video game rating system.</p><p>According to Ubisoft Japan (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/assassins-creed-shadows-will-be-censored-in-japan-to-comply-with-cero/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), depictions of dismemberment have been completely removed from the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Other versions of the game will still have the ability to to toggle the dismemberment feature on or off.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows has also been rated CERO Z by Japan's video game rating system, which is the equivalent of North America's ESRB rating of M. The Japanese version will have some modified voice lines as well, but Ubisoft Japan didn't provide any additional explanation or details.</p><p>This isn't the first time CERO stepped in regarding dismemberment in a video game. 2023's Dead Space remake was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-remakes-japanese-ban-confuses-ea-exec-after-stellar-blade-rating-released/1100-6522831/" data-ref-id="1100-6522831">banned in Japan</a> because of the game's depiction of severed body parts. However, its ban was later criticized after Stellar Blade's Japanese rating was revealed. The game depicted dismemberment, but it was still allowed to be sold in Japan.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows takes place in feudal Japan, which could explain why Ubisoft and the Japan video game ratings board are being extra careful with this release. Director Chris Benoit said that the reason behind the game's second delay was to polish the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-director-reveals-why-game-was-delayed-a-second-time/1100-6528995/" data-ref-id="1100-6528995">parkour mechanics on feudal Japan's architecture</a>.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will launch on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">Assassin's Creed Shadows preview</a>, we said, "Ubisoft Quebec seems poised to be the first to pull together Assassin's Creed's disparate eras, but we've been here before and it's routinely not worked out."</p>
