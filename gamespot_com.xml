                <p>Yet another report has backed up the possibility that Bethesda is working on a Fallout 3 remaster. Following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">report from April</a> that said a Fallout 3 remaster was real but not coming soon, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC has now said</a> it is aware of a remaster of the now-17-year-old RPG.</p><p>The new report didn't have any details on the supposed Fallout 3 remaster, however, apart from how it could be in the vein of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The game launched this year to great success, featuring graphics and performances improvements, as remasters usually do.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-3-review/1900-6200093/">Fallout 3</a> originally came out in 2008 on PC, PS3, and Xbox 360. It was very well-liked and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-ships-47-million-in-first-week/1100-6200678/" data-ref-id="1100-6200678">sold millions of copies.</a> It's playable on Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility, and players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/18e8ko9/why_does_fallout_3_perform_and_look_much_better/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported that the performance is improved</a>, but there has never been a dedicated port or remaster.</p><p>The re-emergence of a possible Fallout 3 remaster came amid an interview that Bethesda's Todd Howard gave to <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a> in which the developer mentioned the team is working on Fallout 76, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and "some other things."

                <p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard has given a new update on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and the big takeaway is that while the game is playable already, it's not releasing anytime soon.</p><p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GQ</a>, Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is "still a long way off." Howard is directing the game, and he told fans that they should get comfortable because it's going to be a while. "I'm preaching patience," he said. "I don't want fans to feel anxious."</p><p>Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is "the everyday thing" as it relates to what he spends his time and attention on these days at the studio.</p><p>"We did a big play test yesterday for The Elder Scrolls 6, and you have to really look at the screen and say, 'What is this? What does this need? Where are we at?' Great games are played, not made. The screen doesn't lie," he added.</p><p>As for why Bethesda didn't immediately make The Elder Scrolls 6 after the massively successful Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Howard said the team "needed a creative reset." So the studio followed up Skyrim with Fallout 4 in 2015, Fallout 76 in 2018, and Starfield in 2023. Throughout these releases, Bethesda also re-released Skyrim on so many platforms it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-jokes-about-skyrim-on-amazon-alex/1100-6459648/" data-ref-id="1100-6459648">became something of a meme.</a></p><p>Bethesda oversaw the development of 2025's The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered from developer Virtuos. It had a successful launch and is now the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 5 best-selling game of 2025 in the US.</a> The game was shadow-dropped, and Howard said he would like to do something like that again with a future Bethesda release like The Elder Scrolls 6.</p><p>"I like to just announce stuff and release it. My perfect version--and I'm not saying this is going to happen--is that it's going to be a while and then, one day, the game will just appear," he said.</p><p>Howard personally announced The Elder Scrolls 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-elder-scrolls-6-is-officially-on-the-way/1100-6459658/" data-ref-id="1100-6459658">at E3 2018</a>. More than seven years later, Bethesda has not shared any official details about the game, however, prompting fans to wonder about the game's status.</p><p>According to Bethesda veteran Bruce Nesmith, who has since left the company, Howard only agreed to announce the game so early because fans were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-announced-elder-scrolls-6-so-early-because-fans-came-with-pitchforks-bruce-nesmith-says/1100-6518603/" data-ref-id="1100-6518603">coming with "pitchforks and torches" inquiring about the game.</a> Howard himself has said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">often wonders if it was the right thing to announce The Elder Scrolls 6 so early</a>. "I have asked myself that a lot," he said. "I don't know. I probably would've announced it more casually."</p><p>Bethesda broke with tradition by announcing The Elder Scrolls 6 so early, as the company previously announced Fallout 4 in June 2015 and launched it just five months later. Skyrim, meanwhile, was announced in December 2010 and debuted less than a year later. Things later shifted, as Bethesda announced Starfield in 2018 and didn't launch it until September 2023.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered saw Bethesda go back to the earlier playbook, though. The game was the subject of numerous leaks and reports, but wasn't actually ever officially announced before it was shadow-dropped in April 2025.</p><p>In addition to The Elder Scrolls 6, Bethesda continues to support Fallout 76 with new content, including things based on the Prime Video TV series. Bethesda is also developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, along with a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported Fallout 3 remaster</a>.</p>

                <p>After a devastating attack left almost 100 people injured in an Indonesian school, the country's president is now mulling over the idea of "restricting online games" because they allegedly make "violence a normal thing."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-10/indonesia-mulls-video-game-curbs-after-jakarta-school-blast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Bloomberg report</a>, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has ordered his cabinet to look into what the restrictions would look like following a police investigation into the violent attack. Subianto didn't clarify what restrictions he and his team had in mind. However, State Secretary Prasetyo Hadi said they're looking at Krafton Inc.'s battle royale shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a>, which is immensely popular in Indonesia.</p><p>"We're thinking about restrictions because, in these games, there [are] many different kinds of weapons," Hadi said. "It's easy to learn. And, psychologically, it makes violence a normal thing."</p><p>In <a href="https://www.anews.com.tr/world/2025/11/10/indonesia-mulls-curbs-on-online-games-like-pubg-after-school-blast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a longer statement to ANews</a>, Hadi expressed the need to find solutions to how games can negatively influence kids, claiming that teachers "must be more aware if their students show any suspicious signs."</p><p>"The president said that we need to come up with ways to restrict and find a solution to the negative effects of online games," Hadi continued. "There is a possibility that such games can influence our youth. Take PUBG as an example. Players can easily learn the types of weapons. And they will start to normalize violence."</p><p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3332169/indonesia-weighs-curbing-pubg-other-video-games-after-jakarta-blast-injures-nearly-100" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The South China Morning Post</a> (SCMP) reported that the attack occurred in North Jakarta on Friday, November 7. As people were gathering for prayers in a mosque inside the State Senior High School 72, an explosion went off that injured 96 people. Police are still investigating the bombing, but early findings currently suggest that a 17-year-old student might've carried out the attack.</p><p>According to SCMP, police found explosive powder and writings from the teenager's home. Police also reportedly uncovered a toy submachine gun that appeared to be inscribed with white supremacist slogans and the names of two neo-Nazis convicted of deadly attacks in Canada and Italy. Police allegedly don't believe this was a terrorist attack, but according to SCMP, they're looking at local media reports suggesting that the teenager--who may have been a grade 12 student--was bullied and wanted revenge.</p><p>ANews corroborated SCMP's reporting via the local outlet, Jakarta Globe News, stating that the student had allegedly brought a homemade bomb to the school.</p><p>"Officers reportedly discovered a soda can believed to be part of the explosive device," the local outlet added (via ANews). "An airsoft-style rifle bearing references to notorious mass shooters was found at the scene."</p><p>Multiple studies over the years have supported and denied the notion that violent video games translate to real-world violence. One from 2014 suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/violent-video-games-dont-lead-to-increases-in-viol/1100-6422421/" data-ref-id="1100-6422421">there's no increase in real-world violence</a> just because people play violent video games. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rfk-cites-video-games-as-a-possible-cause-of-real-world-gun-violence/1100-6534612/" data-ref-id="1100-6534612">United States Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/professor-it-s-clear-playing-violent-games-increases-aggressive-behavior/1100-6417754/" data-ref-id="1100-6417754">Ohio State University communication and psychology professor Brad Bushman</a> have both claimed that there is a correlation between real-world violence and video game violence. The evidence is largely inconclusive, but the connection between real-world violence and video game violence has been a hot-button issue for politicians and scholars for decades. </p><p>Neither publisher Krafton Inc. nor Tencent, which owns a stake in the South Korean publisher, responded to requests for comment, according to media outlets. The suspect is currently receiving medical treatment as the investigation continues.</p>
