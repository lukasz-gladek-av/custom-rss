                <p>The PUBG: Battlegrounds franchise is about to expand with the debut of a new extraction shooter, PUBG: Black Budget. Krafton has also announced that PUBG Studios will have a closed alpha test for Black Budget in December on PC.</p><p>PUBG: Black Budget is introducing more sci-fi and fantasy elements by setting the action on Coli, an island that is locked in a repeating time loop while under threat from the Anomaly, a supernatural phenomenon of unknown origin. The game will also place an emphasis on "exploration and discovery" instead of relying on non-stop combat. Players are tasked with finding "top-secret technology" while attempting to learn more about SAPIENS, a black-budget initiative. The matches will will consist of PvPvE battles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4608474-pugblackbudget.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608474" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4608474-pugblackbudget.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608474"></a><figcaption>Promo art for PUBG: Black Budget.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4608474-pugblackbudget.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608496-pubgblackbudget1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608499-pubgblackbudget2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608500-pubgblackbudget3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608501-pubgblackbudget4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608502-pubgblackbudget5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608503-pubgblackbudget6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608504-pubgblackbudget7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608505-pubgblackbudget8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608506-pubgblackbudget9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608507-pubgblackbudget10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608508-pubgblackbudget11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608496,1300-4608499,1300-4608500,1300-4608501,1300-4608502,1300-4608503,1300-4608504,1300-4608505,1300-4608506,1300-4608507,1300-4608508" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608496-pubgblackbudget1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608499-pubgblackbudget2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608500-pubgblackbudget3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608501-pubgblackbudget4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608502-pubgblackbudget5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608503-pubgblackbudget6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608504-pubgblackbudget7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608505-pubgblackbudget8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608506-pubgblackbudget9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608507-pubgblackbudget10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4608508-pubgblackbudget11.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608496-pubgblackbudget1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608499-pubgblackbudget2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608500-pubgblackbudget3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608501-pubgblackbudget4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608502-pubgblackbudget5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608503-pubgblackbudget6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608504-pubgblackbudget7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608505-pubgblackbudget8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608506-pubgblackbudget9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608507-pubgblackbudget10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608508-pubgblackbudget11.jpg"></figure><p>Info about signing up for the closed alpha test is already on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and the event will last for six days spread across two weeks.

                <p>In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">cancelled multiple unannounced titles</a>, one of them being Whimpact!, a "Pokemon meets Fall Guys" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon.</p><p>Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NWrbMVN84E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NWrbMVN84E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608412,1300-4608413,1300-4608414,1300-4608415,1300-4608416" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"></figure><p>There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more. Players will be able to mix and match powers, including swapping Whims on the fly, during a match as well.</p><p>Both the player characters and the Whims can also be customized with cosmetics including clothing, weapon skins, and the ability to decorate a home base for their characters called a Home Tile. The debut trailer gives us a look at some of the items players will be able to equip, including clothes, hats, and a watermelon sword.</p><p>No official release window has been announced for Whimpact! as of this writing, but the game will launch on PC in early access when it does become available.</p>
