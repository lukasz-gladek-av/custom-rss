                <p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said that Activision offered world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk $300k to lend his name and likeness to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game--an offer that came at a low point for him financially.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick claimed that Hawk was living in his car at the time, going through his second divorce. Kotick said that Hawk was desperate for money, so they signed him up with an additional 1.5% royalty rate that they renegotiated further as time went on.</p><p>"We made Pro Skater, did well, but Pro Skater 2, that was an awesome game. And that was the explosion of the business in some ways," Kotick explained.</p><p>In 2019, Hawk said that Activision offered him a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tony-hawk-activision-offered-him-500000-in-royalties-but-he-said-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$500k buyout for any future royalties</a>, but he turned that down. Hawk's decision paid off, as he revealed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/bk8osb/til_tony_hawk_got_4_million_dollars_on_one_of_his/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he received four million in royalty checks</a> after Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 was released.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released in 1999 for the original PlayStation. It was then later remade for modern platforms in 2020 as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. The last mainline entry in the series was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-hes-no-longer-working-with-activisi/1100-6457017/" data-ref-id="1100-6457017">marking the end of Hawk's contract with Activision</a>.</p><p>While remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">reportedly not in the works</a>, Hawk <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">confirmed that the series will continue on</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI </a>and spoke out against the idea that artificial intelligence technologies will surpass the "creative genius" that is only possible from humans. In an interview, Zelnick said the wait for GTA 6 has been so long in part because developer Rockstar Games is seeking "perfection."</p><p>"What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><p>GTA 5 was released all the way back in 2013 and has been released across three generations of console platforms, in addition to PC. In total, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 210 million copies</a>. Zelnick said GTA 5 has been the "standard bearer" at Take-Two and the video game industry overall in terms of sales success.</p><p>"Grand Theft Auto 6? What can I say? There is enormous anticipation inside our company and in the marketplace as a whole. We couldn't be more excited," he said.</p><p>After years of development, GTA 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">set for release in Fall 2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Zelnick recently admitted the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">could be delayed</a>, but for now, it remains on track for release this year. Before this, Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">understands that fans are frustrated over the long wait for GTA 6. </a></p><p>As for his comments on AI, Zelnick said Take-Two's teams have been using digital tools since the earliest days of video game development, going on to say that the video game industry is known to be an innovator in this area. He said he expects that to continue with new AI technologies, but he also made it clear that AI cannot replace a human when it comes to creativity.</p><p>"The genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human," he said. "We believe in protecting and paying human beings. We believe we ought to pay for their work if it's replicated by AI after the work is done. We don't think it's the right thing to do to ask someone to perform once, use their work over and over again, and not pay for it. We don't think that's right."</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said artificial intelligence as a term makes no sense because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">machines do not learn--humans do.</a> "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever," he said. "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>In other news, Zelnick recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-launch-could-help-improve-console-sales-significantly-take-two-boss-says/1100-6529348/" data-ref-id="1100-6529348">a big game like GTA 6 could help lift console sales. </a></p>

                <p>In 2016, Universal and Activision Blizzard brought World of Warcraft to the big screen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-movie-review/1100-6440592/" data-ref-id="1100-6440592">Warcraft</a>. The film only earned $47.4 million in the United States, but its worldwide total was $439.1 million. Regardless, Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, recently shared his belief that Warcraft was not only one of the worst movies he's ever seen, he also cited it as one of the reasons why World of Warcraft veteran designer Chris Metzen left Blizzard in 2016.</p><p>While appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Grit podcast</a>, Kotick explained that Metzen became burned out during the production of the Warcraft movie. Kotick added that he felt it was "a terrible idea" to make the film, but the deal was already in place before Activision merged with Blizzard. He also went on to say that Warcraft proved to be a major distraction for Blizzard that took the company's focus off of the games.</p><p>"It took a lot of resources and distracted [Blizzard]," recalled Kotick. "You think about all these people who make video games for a living and now they have the chance to like make a movie and they're like helping with the casting and they're on the set and it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, you know patches weren't getting done on time and... it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."</p><p>Kotick added that he begged Metzen to return to Blizzard, which he finally did in 2022. Since Metzen's comeback, Kotick noted that they have hardly spoken, before asking rhetorically, "What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?"</p><p>Despite Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it was recently reaffirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-world-of-warcraft-is-not-coming-to-game-pass/1100-6529082/" data-ref-id="1100-6529082">World of Warcraft is not coming to Game Pass</a>. World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024</a>, and there's no end in sight for the game.</p>
