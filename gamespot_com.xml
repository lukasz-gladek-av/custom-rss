                <p dir="ltr">Indie developer Night Dial has just released its latest horror game, titled "Crowded. Followed." The game sees players step into the shoes of an unnamed protagonist who stumbles across a disturbed, dying man in the middle of what seems to be a massive street party. The man urges the player to take a (rather diseased-looking) briefcase from him, warning them that the briefcase will cause them to be followed by an unknown entity.</p><p dir="ltr">From the looks of the trailer, the game's plot appears quite similar to that of 2014's It Follows, a horror film about a woman who is haunted by a cursed, evil force that follows her through life, often taking on the appearance of other people.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyDjc2iO7AM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qyDjc2iO7AM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"This thingâ€¦ it may take the form of someone else," the man on the ground tells the protagonist as a creepy, ghoulish creature resembling a very tall <a href="https://thering.fandom.com/wiki/Samara_Morgan" rel="nofollow ">Samara</a> rounds the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">As the title suggests, Crowded. Followed. sees players fighting to hold onto the briefcase and navigate their way through winding streets, busy metropolitan areas, and a huge party at a club, all while being relentlessly stalked by the unnamed shapeshifter. Interestingly, the protagonist can be seen clutching an asthma inhaler at various points in the trailer, suggesting players may have to contend with medical issues in addition to the whole "sleep paralysis demon wants my briefcase" thing.</p><p>Night Dial's latest analog horror title takes about 60 - 90 minutes to complete, making it a great title to try out for horror-lovers who don't have 18-25 hours to devote to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/">the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. Crowded. Followed. is wallet-friendly, too--the game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948790/CROWDED_FOLLOWED/" rel="nofollow ">currently available on Steam</a>, where it can be purchased for $6 USD (though it's currently on sale for $5.39). A free demo is also available for download.</p>

allow players to further customize their experience," the publisher says.</p><p dir="ltr">All of the familiar accessibility features that were included with Modern Warfare 3 will also be available in Black Ops 6, such as graphical adjustment options to reduce motion blur and joystick setting options. However, new settings aim to improve the customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">This includes Black Ops 6's new asymmetrical hearing compensation setting, which allows players with asymmetrical hearing loss to create a custom audio profile and adjust audio settings for each ear. Activision says this was created with veterans and players with hearing loss in mind, allowing the audio settings to be individually customizable for each ear.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision also recently detailed Black Ops 6's more immersive audio features and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-gets-audio-upgrades-plus-setting-to-help-with-tinnitus/1100-6527145/">discussed the new Reduce Tinnitus Sound accessibility setting</a>. In addition to audio features, Black Ops 6 will also include some new visual accessibility settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's High Contrast mode was first introduced in Modern Warfare 3, giving players the option to highlight allies and enemies during gameplay, but the feature was only available for the campaign. This year, High Contrast mode will be available to use in both campaign and Zombies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389873"></a><figcaption>High Contrast mode in Zombies</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389873-bo6accessibilityzombies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The mode has also been upgraded, so now players will be able to customize the color outline of allies and enemies, which allows those with vision impairment and color blindness to tailor their player experience even more. Players will even be able to enable a "Dark Background" setting in High Contrast mode, which further adds contrast from the background elements to assist with low vision. An example of this can be seen in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">Another newly introduced feature in Black Ops 6 is the ability to adjust the gameplay HUD with a variety of layout presets, as well as color adjustments for the minimap. Activision says that players who wish to reduce visual clutter or find the minimap distracting might want to test out the Target Tracker or Central Command presets.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Zombies maps feature spider-like enemies, so players will have an option to toggle on an optional arachnophobia setting, which visually removes the enemies' legs. The image shown below reveals how the enemy will look with and without the setting activated. Activision says this setting will change their appearance "without affecting their gameplay," but it's uncertain how this will work for the enemy hitboxes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4389874"></a><figcaption>Zombies mode arachnophobia setting</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4389874-bo6arachnophobiasetting.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another new feature for Zombies is the ability to pause, save, and then load back into games. It's worth noting that this feature comes with some restrictions. This pause and save feature is only available when playing solo matches, and a player can only save and quit while at full health.</p><p dir="ltr">"With the return of round-based Zombies, gameplay is guaranteed to be fast-paced and intense, so providing the ability to pause or save a solo game and return later can make all the difference in gameplay for some players," Activision says.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the publisher confirms that both the Xbox Adaptive controller and Sony's Access controller will work out of the box with Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.

But there's a catch: These eye-catching accessories appear to be exclusive to Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed via <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/10/23/20241023-ps5/" rel="nofollow ">a blog post on PlayStation Japan's website</a>, "limited quantities" of the themed controller and faceplate are scheduled to go on sale the same day the game launches.

The black console cover is a bit more understated, with a small accent design on the lower right corner featuring the same logo in the same shade of red as the controller.</p><p>There's no telling if or when Monster Hunter-loving PlayStation owners in other markets will be able to get their hands on the new DualSense controller and PS5 faceplate, as both items seem to be Japan-only exclusives. But it's certainly hard to deny their beauty.
