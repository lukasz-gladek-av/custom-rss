                <p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blox-fruits/">Blox Fruits</a> might just be the biggest, and that doubles for both popularity and scope. With a level cap of a whopping 2800, working your way up from the beginning is one hell of a journey. Luckily, we’re here to help you with Blox Fruits leveling and offer some small tips that’ll help you as you battle enemies and try to get more powerful in this thrilling Roblox experience.</p><h2 id="Blox_Fruits_Leveling_Explained">Blox Fruits Leveling Explained</h2><p>There are plenty of ways to level up in Blox Fruits, and even more reasons for doing so. Naturally, like any other RPG, you will get stronger with every level, and this is the key to taking on more powerful enemies on different islands.</p><p>For clarity, leveling up will give you access to several new things, including:</p><ul><li>New islands to explore</li><li>3 stat points to spend as you like</li><li>Level-gated NPC quests</li><li>Other gameplay elements like Raids, Awakening Fruits, and Elite Pirates</li></ul><p>One of the most important parts of leveling up is the stat points, which you can spend in any of the following categories:</p><ul><li>Melee</li><li>Defense</li><li>Sword</li><li>Gun</li><li>Blox Fruit</li></ul><p>How you spend your stats will depend on your playstyle, but it is important to remember that Melee increases your energy, while Defense increases your health. Then, later, when you unlock different Blox Fruits, the Blox Fruit stat will increase each Fruit’s damage.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_For_Leveling">Best Blox Fruits For Leveling</h2><p>Early in the game, the best Blox Fruit for leveling up is the Buddha. If you can get your hands on it, this Legendary-tier Fruit transforms the user into a golden, glowing, giant.</p><p>This transformation crucially negates a huge chunk of incoming damage, meaning you can tank some big hits. But it also extends your hit box, making it easier for you to mow enemies down. Alongside this, it also has several AoE-focused special attacks, making it easy for you to hit multiple foes at once and spread out your damage. This is fantastic for farming smaller enemies when you want to grind XP, and also helps you to take on some of the tougher early bosses in the game. If you do pick up the Buddha early, it is also wise to power up your Melee stat to boost its power, and the defensive capabilities of the Buddha mean you can worry less about the Defense stat.</p><p>However, at a whopping $1,200,000, or 1,650 Robux, you may not be able to pick up the Buddha for a little while. In the meantime, some other picks like Flame or Light can offer a huge help at the start of your Blox Fruit journey. Both Flame and Light have great damage stats, but Light also has some fantastic mobility to help you find those first few islands.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_Fighting_Style_For_Leveling_Up">Best Blox Fruits Fighting Style For Leveling Up</h2><p>At the beginning of Blox Fruits, it's best to focus on either the Melee or Sword fighting style to just help you quickly grind through the early enemy NPCs you‘ll find scattered around the seas. While there are many better fighting styles later on, Sword and Melee are really effective for just spamming enemies and growing those early levels.</p><h2 id="Best_Tips_For_Leveling_Up_In_Blox_Fruits">Best Tips For Leveling Up In Blox Fruits</h2><p>How you choose to grind through Blox Fruits is entirely up to you, and the way you level up will ultimately be defined by your preferred playstyle. However, there are some basic tips that should help people, no matter how they like to play.</p><p>First of all, be mindful of the accessory you use. While most of the time you should just choose one that you like, or love the design for, when grinding, you should be focusing on boosting your stats to save time. Early items like the Black Cape are great here, which you have a chance of earning by defeating Elite Pirates.</p><p>One slightly cheesy method folks love to implement has been dubbed the ‘Fountain Method’ as it is particularly useful on the First Sea’s Fountain Island. Upon engaging with certain mobs, if there is a wall nearby, you can simply hop behind the wall and attack from a distance. While enemies have a much lower range behind walls, yours is slightly longer, so you can use this to spam even very tough enemies. Just be careful of your distance!</p><p>Next, while it can be good to find the toughest enemies you can currently handle when you're grinding, you generally save time grinding islands with more mobs, even if they aren’t quite as strong. This is also very important when using double XP codes, which, while very effective, work better against large amounts of enemies instead of a single high-level mob or boss.</p><p>Finally, if you are grinding bosses and are getting sick of waiting for them to respawn, many players find it helpful to jump between servers to find one where the boss is available again. This can be fantastic for grinding XP and items from those tough bosses.</p><h2 id="Best_Blox_Fruits_Locations_For_Early_Leveling_Up">Best Blox Fruits Locations For Early Leveling Up</h2><p>There are plenty of great places to grind levels in Blox Fruits, but if you’re just starting out, or bumping up against some difficult enemies, here are some of the best places to grind in the first sea and those essential early levels.</p><ul><li>1-55 - Grind the bandits on the opening island, then use the Fountain Method on Fountain Island</li><li>55-90 - Attack the Chef on Pirate Island, and use server hopping to get quicker respawns</li><li>90-105 - Grind by attacking the Snow Bandit in the Frozen Village</li><li>105-130 - Attack the Yeti Boss in the Frozen Village, and remember to use server hopping</li><li>130-220 - Use server hopping to grind the Vice Admiral boss in Marine Fortress</li><li>220-350 - Grind the bosses in the Prison using server hopping</li><li>350-435 - Attack the Magma Admiral in the Magma Village and use server hopping to ensure respawns</li><li>425-500 Attack the Fishman Lord in Underwater City</li></ul>
