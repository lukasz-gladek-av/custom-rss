One person on Reddit posted a photo of the game's Phantom Edition for PS5. It sports the PEGI logo, which means the copy of game likely came from a European retailer, but it's not clear which one.</p><p>Many theorized that, although this person obtained a copy of the game early, they might not be able to play until the servers officially go live. However, the person said the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">servers are online already and the campaign is playable as well.</a> Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">EA says Battlefield 6 servers go live on October 10. </a></p><p>Others have apparently <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1975197858497454532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained a physical copy of Battlefield 6 already as well</a>. Given this, people who care about spoilers for the campaign may want to be extra mindful for the next few days until launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC; it's not coming to last-gen platforms and there is no early access like there was for Battlefield 2042.</p><p>The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">not coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, but EA Play Pro subscribers can get Battlefield 6's Phantom Edition ($100 USD) as part of the subscription, which costs $17/month.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first entry in the series since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that was a disappointment for many fans. Early signs look more positive for Battlefield 6, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">experts do not believe the game has enough juice to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year.</a> In any event, EA is having some playful fun with the competition, recently releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-pokes-fun-at-call-of-duty/1100-6535075/" data-ref-id="1100-6535075">live-action trailer for Battlefield 6</a> that roasts Call of Duty.</p><p>In other news, Battlefield owner EA is in the process of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">acquired by an investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>

                <p>Recently, a rumor swirled online that Microsoft was canceling its next-generation Xbox plans, but that is apparently not true or the full story. Microsoft said in a statement that it is "actively investing" in future first-party consoles and devices that are "designed, engineered, and built by Xbox."</p><p>The statement, shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, pointed fans to the announcement from June this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft is working with AMD on future consoles and devices. </a></p><p>At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond said Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room and in your hands."</p><p>In February 2024, Bond said the next Xbox would offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><h2><strong>What did the original source say?</strong></h2><p>The rumors that Microsoft had canceled future Xbox hardware plans stemmed from <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/page-29#post-270866538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum member SneakersSO</a>, who said plans for future Xbox hardware had morphed from "really concrete" to "up in the air." The internet did what the internet does and extrapolated from this that plans for future Xbox devices made by Microsoft had been canceled, even though the source did not say that.</p><p>The person added that Microsoft's future may be more focused on games, and specifically its biggest franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Candy Crush, and Forza Horizon and away from dedicated hardware. To that end, the report said Microsoft will look to further push Xbox Cloud Gaming on more devices to help drive Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren, a person known for breaking stories about Xbox, said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ny8bms/tom_warren_sneakersso_knows_a_lot_of_what_goes_on/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person is known to have reliable sources and good information</a>. This is presumably part of the reason why the "Xbox is dead" story spread so fast and wide over the weekend prior to Microsoft issuing its statement.</p><h2><strong>Xbox's struggles</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that the Xbox platform is lagging behind PlayStation this console generation, with monthly US sales reports from Circana showing Xbox regularly ranking third against PlayStation and Nintendo. Microsoft itself has told fans they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">do not need an Xbox to play Xbox games</a>. Thanks to Game Pass and the cloud, the devices people may already own--including a smartphone or tablet--can play Xbox games via Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is reminding people of this with its "This is an Xbox" campaign.</p><p>Xbox has also faced public perception challenges of late thanks to the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures</a>. Most recently, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's price by 50%, up to $30/month</a>, with many saying Microsoft is a greedy company looking to squeeze players even more.</p>

Although Unity states that there is no evidence of any impact on users, developers are still recommended to "rebuild your games and applications with updated Unity versions."</p><p>In response to the discovery, Obsidian announced on Friday that it had temporarily removed some of its titles from digital storefronts to "implement the necessary updates" toward the security issue. Along with Avowed Premium Edition, Obsidian also removed the Grounded 2 Founders Edition and Founders Pack, Pillars of Eternity: Hero Edition and Definitive Edition, Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire and its Ultimate Edition, and Pentiment.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>A security vulnerability affecting our games that use Unity has recently been identified. </p><p> As a precaution and to keep you safe, we have temporarily removed the following titles and products from digital storefronts while we implement the necessary updates to address the issue:…</p></div>  — Obsidian (@Obsidian) <a href="https://twitter.com/Obsidian/status/1974215697845923976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Our team is working on a fix and will restore these games as soon as possible. We will provide additional information once they are available again," Obsidian said in an X post, which also encouraged those who have the affected games installed to update them when patches become available.</p><p>Pentiment and both Pillars of Eternity games run on Unity. While Avowed and Grounded 2 run on Unreal Engine 5, <a href="https://x.com/Obsidian/status/1974221858531614831" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Obsidian clarified on X</a> that Unity is used for the digital artbook included with Avowed Premium Edition. Grounded 2, which is currently in early access, also includes an artbook in its Founders Pack, though Obsidian didn't explicitly confirm if this artbook was also built in Unity.</p><p>Obsidian was far from the only studio affected by the security vulnerability, with Unity-built titles including Overcooked 2 and Among Us receiving quick patches in response to the issue, while the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1nx8xpm/fallout_shelter_delisted_from_steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC version of Fallout Shelter</a> still remains delisted.</p>

"I have no update on timing for release," NateTheHate 2 added in response to a question about the prequel starring Arthur Morgan. The theory floated to the leaker was that Rockstar would want to release these new editions fairly soon, with the studio focusing on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> next year.</p>
