                <p>Exactly 40 years ago today, the Nintendo Entertainment System hit store shelves in New York City. The October 18, 1985 launch of the NES in the US revitalized home console gaming in North America. To commemorate the console's pivotal role in gaming history, 8BitDo is releasing a <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/nes-40th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new collection of NES-inspired gear</a> over the next few months. The NES40 Collection features three products: a <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">limited-edition Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller bundle</a>, a compact <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/retro-cube-2-speaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless gaming speaker</a>, and an <a href="http://www.8bitdo.com/retro-68-keyboard-nes-40th/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ultra-premium 68-key mechanical keyboard</a> made of aluminum alloy.</p><p>Preorders for the NES40 Collection open today. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller bundle is limited to 1,985 units, and the N40 Edition wireless keyboard is limited edition, too. The new Retro Cube 2 Speaker is joining 8BitDo's everyday lineup as the first wireless speaker from the manufacturer in a decade.</p><div title="[8BitDo] 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth N40 Edition Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4732" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[8BitDo] 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth N40 Edition Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.8bitdo.com\/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller - N40 Edition Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.8bitdo.com\/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.8bitdo.com/ultimate-2-bluetooth-nes-40th/">$80 | Limited to 1,985 units | Releases November 15</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The N40 Edition of the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller retails for $80, which is just $10 more than the MSRP of the standard <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Controller-Black-Gaming-Console/dp/B0F2H6VKP8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Joysticks-Switchable-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DRCRDGP4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Switchable-Vibration-Switch-Nintendo/dp/B0FB8WGG6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">yellow</a> editions. Considering the bundle comes with several notable extras, the N40 Edition is honestly a bargain. You'll get an exclusive transparent black 8BitDo Retro Receiver for real NES consoles. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and other 8BitDo Bluetooth controllers can sync wirelessly to original hardware with the adapter. A solid black version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Retro-Receiver-nintendo-entertainment-system/dp/B01DJB43R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Receiver</a>, for reference, carries a $25 MSRP. The bundle also includes a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Ultimate-Charging-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0CSDJF38Y?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">travel case</a>, which 8BitDo normally sells separately for $20. Inside the box, you'll find four custom joystick caps, including a pair emblazoned with "NES" and "40," and an 8BitBot keychain.</p><p>Though themed around Nintendo Entertainment System with its red face buttons, multiple tones of gray, and special-edition dock matching the design of the console, the N40 is a celebration of 40 years of Nintendo hardware. The handles are decorated with the dates of Nintendo home console and portable device launches around the world. The only exception here is the June 15, 2025 date on the right side of the controller, as this represents the date 8BitDo created the N40. The NES launch date is emblazoned in red, while the rest are in black. Most of the dates reference console launches in North America or global releases, but there are a couple tied to hardware launches in Europe and Japan. From top to bottom on each side, Here's what each date references:</p><p>Left handle: Wii U (NA), NES (NA), Nintendo 64 (NA), Nintendo Switch (WW), Switch OLED (WW), SNES (NA), Wii (NA), GameCube (NA).</p><p>Right handle: Game Boy (NA), Virtual Boy (NA), Switch Lite (WW), 3DS (EU), DS (NA), Game Boy Color (JP), Game Boy Advance (NA).</p></div>                      </div><figure

of the additional accessories, the N40 is the same flagship controller 8BitDo launched earlier this year. The Ultimate 2 supports 2.4GHz Wireless connections on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and PC. It also has Bluetooth support for Switch 1/2, Android, Apple, and SteamOS. It can run for up to 25 hours on a full charge and has a 1,000MHz polling rate. It's fitted with high-end TMR electromagnetic joysticks, two remappable back buttons, and an extra pair of claw shoulder buttons. It also has two trigger modes: Hall Effect linear and non-linear microswitch buttons (rapid-fire mode). Other features include 6-axis motion controls, two rumble motors, a Turbo button, and RGB lighting rings. Control customizations can be made with 8BitDo's Ultimate Software 2, and you can save up to three custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly.</p><p>Read our dedicated story on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-switch-2-pc-controller-review-best-deals-at-amazon/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth</a> for more details.

It has two audio modes, one geared toward gaming and another for music, and a built-in microphone. The NES-style D-pad isn't just for show; the D-pad controls the volume, play/pause, and is used to sync your devices.</p><p>It comes with a wireless charging dock that also has room for the USB-C cord. And just like with the charging dock on the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth and Pro 3 Bluetooth Gamepad, the dock has a built-in wireless extender for 2.4GHz audio.</p><p>The Retro Cube 2 has a 2,000mAh rechargeable battery with up to 30 hours of playback on a full charge.

Generally, keyboards with 68 keys are called 65% keyboards. So far, 8BitDo's mechanical keyboards have been tenkeyless 87-key models and full-size 108-key editions.</p><p>Unlike the vast majority of 8BitDo products, the Retro 68 is <em>expensive</em>. At $500, it's by far the priciest product in 8BitDo's catalog. For reference, 8BitDo keyboards typically sell for around $100. So, why does the N40 Edition cost so much more? Every component is made of aluminum alloy, from the frame to the keycaps to the first pair of wireless Super Buttons. The large microswitch buttons can be reprogrammed on the fly without using 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2.</p><p>The custom gasket-mounted N40 Edition uses Kailh Box Ice Cream Pro Max Linear Switches with six custom dampeners and RGB backlighting. Like other 8BitDo keyboards, the N40 Edition has a hot-swappable PCB--though it's hard to imagine wanting to switch out the aluminum alloy components.</p><p>The Retro 68 supports Bluetooth LE, 2.4GHz Wireless, and wired connections. It can run for 300 hours on a full charge and supports Ultimate Software V2. It's compatible with Windows and Android and includes a protective pouch and a certificate of authenticity. </p><p>If you get the Retro 68, it makes sense to pair it with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Charging-Programmable-Switches-Ambidextrous/dp/B0DZ6KLY8K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro R8 Wireless Mouse</a>, which launched earlier this year and is themed around the NES, too.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><h2>8BitDo Ultimate 2 &amp; Keyboard Deals</h2><p>If you like the look of the N40 Edition and don't want to spend $500, the good news is the 8BitDo N Edition TKL Mechanical Keyboard is only $90 at Amazon.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Shadow of the Colossus is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, October 18, 2025. Below, we examine the moral complexity of its narrative as told through its silent protagonist.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Does a silent protagonist equal a self-insert? The logic of many video games dictates yes. Heroes like Gordon Freeman and Link have been forever silent, only grunting or shouting. Even Master Chief, who does have a voice, obscures his face. Under his mask, there could be anyone there.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this common logic, silence is often alienating. Few games embody this better than the works of Fumido Ueda. The protagonists of Shadow of the Colossus, Ico, and The Last Guardian are taciturn, often silent or speaking only a fantastical language, which is either subtitled or not immediately understood. Moments of speech, or even of action outside of player input, are profound and rare.</p><p dir="ltr">Under the logic of silent identification, these protagonists would be simple, iconographic player stand-ins. Yet Ueda's curated gaps create an empathetic distance from his games' heroes. Over the 20 years since Shadow of the Colossus' release, it has proven its profundity as a moral fable because of its distance from the player.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="79768368"

Protagonist Wander's quest is grounded in games past. He seeks to rescue his love from death. To do so, he must slay the titular colossi: massive foes strewn across a forbidden land. The entity spurring Wander on, Dormin, is a voice from the heavens haloed in light. Wander wields a legendary sword--one whose connection with the sun guides him on his quest. In every superficial sense, he is the epitome of a hero. He has a noble quest, a holy tool, and monstrous foes meant for killing.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is the aggressor. For many of the colossi, he must fire his bow and arrow at them to even gain their attention. It is only when he intrudes on their space, and often not until he attacks them, that they will attack him. The colossi bleed black. It spurts from them as Wander stabs them. They moan, flail, weep, and scream as he climbs over and on them. Each colossus has an animal nobility, which Wander murders. Each element is a part of Shadow of the Colossus' rhetoric. Collectly, they change the usual aspects of heroic fantasy into something horrifying.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, Wander is not a cypher or a stand-in. Often, games with silent protagonists start from a position of relative normalcy. Think of Gordon Freeman's long train ride to the office in Half-Life, or Link's childhood stomping ground of Kokiri Forest in Ocarina of Time. In Shadow of the Colossus, we start midway through Wander's journey as he travels on horseback over the land. When he arrives and places his love Mono on an altar, we learn only a few things about him. One, he carries an "ancient sword," as Dormin calls it. Two, he is attempting to free his love from death and some curse. Three, his horse Agro is a loyal and courageous companion. There is the suggestion of a life lived outside the bounds of the games. There are things that matter that the player cannot yet see or know about.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, Wander's exact motivations are shadowy. His relationship with Mono is never depicted. Instead we see how he acts without her. His journey to kill the colossi is strenuous and dangerous both, yet he continues with almost unfailing motivation. The player can direct him to stand over Mono's body on the altar. The camera zooms in, intimate in a way the game rarely is otherwise. Wander's love is profound, and perhaps selfish given how much he will destroy to see it restored, yet we do not witness it, and thus struggle to identify with it directly. Shadow of the Colossus builds this understanding through gestures that accumulate into cascading meaning.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these gestures, the game takes on a theatrical quality. The player inhabits Wander as an actor might play a role. The player makes some choices, like how often he visits Mono between besting colossi or whether their own skill will define him as a dexterous warrior or a clumsy, though strong-willed, commoner. Yet, the form is set. Wander has made his choices. The player can only interpret them.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a massive contrast with many other games, which are often concerned with the main character's morality. BioShock and Spec Ops: The Line, for example, use the main character as a player surrogate. BioShock's plot twist emphasizes how little agency the player actually has in the story, turning its hero into a hapless stooge. In Spec Ops: The Line, the player's will to finish the game and protagonist Walker's belief in the importance of his mission are equivocated. As Walker's determination damns him, it implicates the player too. In loading screens and monologues, Spec Ops admonishes the player to stop playing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586935"></a><figcaption>Shadow of the Colossus (2018)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4586935-3346064-colossus_7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both these games have a little more under the hood than mere player condemnation, yet there is something shallow about their approach to protagonist morality. The developers themselves are curiously absent from this logic, for example. BioShock's twist has dramatic force, but little emotional heft. The protagonist isn't anyone; he is only a tool. The twist relies on player identification that comes only from absence. Spec Ops: The Line fairs better in this regard. Walker is a character of at least two dimensions. Yet, if he is a character who acts on his own terms, why all this discussion of player complicity? The moral swing cannot quite implicate the player in any real way.</p><p dir="ltr">Shadow of the Colossus is also interested in agency, but not that of the player--, rather, of Wander himself. BioShock and Spec Ops are both loud. Antagonists Andrew Ryan and John Konrad explain tell the themes to the player in direct terms. Shadow of the Colossus is quiet. Its world is full of empty spaces and empty time. That emptiness leads to an empathetic, though still distant, stance. Through the process of play, the player comes to understand Wander. That process of embodiment is fuzzy, mythical, not simple or reducible. Shadow of the Colossus doesn’t treat the player as a hapless stooge, unable to really understand the situation at hand until the game’s writers offer their magnanimous help. Wander’s wrongdoing is not a twist. That fact allows the player to sit with it, even to embody it for a time.</p><p dir="ltr">Condemnation is cheap; it is understanding that is hard won and difficult. Though Walker has more voice lines and more writing, Wander still feels more real because his personhood is not attached to the player. Instead, there is a sense of an exchange. We feel for Wander and mourn for him. That relationship has a deeper and more profound bearing on our own morality than simple condemnation. If we ask whether we are guilty, Shadow of the Colossus will always be silent.</p><p dir="ltr">At the game's end, after a fellowship sworn to stop Wander arrives and seals him within the forbidden land, Wander goes where the player cannot follow. The sealing process has turned him into a child, which the successfully resurrected Mono seems to want to raise. All of Wander's heroics and strength have been sapped out of him. He is now a creature incapable of holding a controller.</p><p dir="ltr">That ambiguous end is part of what gives Shadow of the Colossus its lasting power. We were Wander's companions for a time. We walked with him. But his fate is his own. So too, is ours.</p>
