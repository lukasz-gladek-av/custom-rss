                <p>You spend a lot of time in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> seeking out a variety of items topside to help Speranza thrive down below. One quest called Root of the Matter tasks you with visiting the Research Building to find a seed vault. If you've arrived in the building and want to know where to find the seed vault, we'll cover the bases for you in this guide.</p><p>Note that you won't need to extract to complete this quest. Because of this--and given how dangerous the Research Building and surrounding areas can be to explore--we'd recommend bringing a free loadout unless you're feeling particularly confident in your survival skills.</p><p>When you're ready to find the seed vault and wrap up Root of the Matter, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the seed vault in the room with a great view</h2><p>Your first objective in Root of the Matter is to head to the Research Building. This building is located to the right of Marano Park and is a very popular and chaotic area to explore. It's often overflowing with other raiders eager to pick fights, as well as a variety of ARC both inside and outside. Be especially aware of approaching from the Marano Park side, as there are often large ARC patrolling within the square.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319" data-ratio="0.56327160493827" data-width="1944" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319"></a><figcaption>Research Building</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Research Building, search for the "room with a great view," which is on the west side of the building with a massive window overlooking the park. In here, you can find the seed vault, which is a cylindrical container against the wall. Interact with it to secure the seeds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320"></a><figcaption>Here's where you'll find the seed vault.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg"></figure><p>Now that the quest is complete, you can continue looting or fighting to your heart's content. You don't need to extract for the quest to count, but if you decide you want to get out alive (as you should), the Northern Station is nearby to the northwest of the Research Building, offering a place for a clean getaway. Just be careful heading down the steps, as the train stations in Buried City often house Pod ARCs that will explode when you get near them. Good luck!</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>The cooking game Overcooked is getting adapted into a competition reality series for Netflix, according to a new report. The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported.</a></p><p>The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the report said.</p><p>The series is said to be in the "early stages" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.</p><p>Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. </p><p>A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.</p><p>The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix.

It can be a lot of fun to track things down on your own, but it can also prove challenging at times. If you're struggling to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest, we'll help you along with things.</p><p>Note that you need to extract from the topside with Major Aiva's Patch once you obtain it. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bring along an augment with a safe pocket so that you can ensure you don't lose your quest item even if you fall in battle.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, read on for where to find Major Aiva's Patch in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest</h2><p>Your first objective for Echoes of Victory Ridge will be to actually find Victory Ridge, which is located in the northern portion of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Zoom in and seek the West Broken Bridge POI--that's where you're headed. Note that this is a mostly safe area in the majority of matches, but you never know if you might run into other questers, so keep an eye out and try to be friendly. Or shoot them on site--it's your call.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275" data-ratio="0.55354993983153" data-width="1662" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275"></a><figcaption>West Broken Bridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the circled area above, you'll need to look for a small box containing Major Aiva's Patch. This can be hard to spot if you don't know where to search. Look around for part of the fallen road that can be crawled under--more easily spotted if standing on the northern end of the POI and looking south. Under the right side of this crumbled road is the box with Major Aiva's Patch inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277"></a><figcaption>Major Aiva's Patch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg"></figure><p>Place Major Aiva's Patch in your safe pocket if you came equipped with one, then head east to the North Complex Elevator to extract.
