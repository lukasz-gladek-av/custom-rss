                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> version 1.6 launched for PC in March, but console and mobile players were told they'd have to wait for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/#11" data-ref-id="2900-5177">enormous free update</a> to land on their platform of choice. Stardew Valley developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone paused all work on his next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, to focus on getting Stardew Valley's final major update out on all platforms, and months later, the 1.6.9 update is now available for all players.</p><p>The 1.6.9 update includes a number of useful features, like the ability to put legendary-tier fish in ponds and a couple of new ways for players to to rescue items they've accidentally lost. The update also includes bug fixes, balance tweaks, and new gameplay features.</p><p>As far as the new stuff goes, the Stardew Valley 1.6.9 update adds the following features to the game:</p><ul><li>If you lose an item that can’t be found again, check the Secret Woods for a new NPC who can get it back... for a price. </li><li>Players can now put legendary fish in fish ponds. Only one fish can fit in each pond. Ponds with legendary fish will produce legendary fish roe. Each legendary fish turns the pond's water a different color.</li><li>Players can now place beds and sleep inside any constructed buildings that allow furniture.</li><li>Items dropped in water will now float for a brief time, so players can collect them if they're quick (or if they have a magnet ring).</li><li>Sam and Shane's work portraits will now appear inside JojaMartas long as they're working there.</li><li>Some dialogue has been slightly tweaked.</li><li>New Easter eggs have been added to the game.</li><li>Hidden cheat commands have been added (on platforms where a save edit is possible).</li></ul><p>Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-dev-finally-finishes-playing-the-game-says-1-6-update-is-coming-to-console-next-week/1100-6527481/" data-ref-id="1100-6527481">confirmed the update's release date</a> in a post on the Stardew Valley forums back in September. The 1.6.9 update contains content than the original 1.6 update lacked, including quality-of-life changes like pine trees providing extra lumber, weeds no longer preventing fruit trees from growing, and the addition of new items to certain in-game shops.</p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that the update <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853506548250869801" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">isn't yet working for PlayStation users in Europe</a>. Additionally, it seems to have caused a bug resulting in <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1853521395080368514" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">disappearing chickens</a> for new players using the Meadowlands farm. Barone acknowledged both issues on Twitter, and confirmed that he's currently working to fix them.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at the full 1.6.9 patch notes, or check them out via <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-9-changelog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official website</a>.</p><h2>Stardew Valley 1.6.9 patch notes</h2><h3>New content &amp; features</h3><ul><li>If you lost an item that can’t be found again, a <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Secret_Woods#Lost_Items_Shop" rel="nofollow ">new friend appears in the secret woods</a> who can get it back (for a price).</li><li>You can now put legendary fish in fish ponds.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on November 4, and the patch notes include several major changes. This includes nerfs to the overpowered flashbangs and the Recon Combat Speciality bonus. The game's snaking movement has also been reduced.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the patch notes, Treyarch says there's been "enough snaking," and the movement is now nerfed. Snaking is an exploit where a player rapidly switches between the prone and crouch positions while stationed behind a cover, making themselves harder to hit. However, that movement will be slower and less impactful with the update adjusting the stance-change cooldowns to reduce effectiveness of repeated snaking motion.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also adjusts the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/controversial-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-x-ray-vision-perk-is-in-treyarch-crosshairs/1100-6527561/">frustrating Recon Combat Speciality</a> bonus, which previously gave players too much information. Now, the Recon bonus will only provide users with limited-time wall hacks for 1.5 seconds instead of 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update has nerfed the game's powerful flashbangs, reducing the equipment's screen effect duration by 20%. The update only changes how powerful flashbangs are, but it doesn't mention the current XP exploit that lets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xp-farming-trick-turns-you-into-a-terrible-teammate/1100-6527534/">players toss flashbangs for extra points</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A few weapons received tuning with the new update. This includes slight nerfs to damage and the range of popular assault rifles, such as the XM4, Ames 85, and Model L. All weapons in the submachine class were buffed with higher damage ranges, which Treyarch says is meant to make the guns more effective during mid-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The popular Nuketown map was added to the game in a 24/7 playlist on November 1, but now the new update makes the map available to play in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov4" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-season-1-start-date-confirmed-and-its-very-soon/1100-6527474/">Call of Duty Season 1</a> arrives on November 14.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2's</a> iconic E3 2003 demo, much of which did not appear in the final game when it launched a year later, will finally be playable next week via a Steam Workshop mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on PC, just in time for Halo 2's 20th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod will be available for free and will release November 9, the same day Halo 2 released in 2004. In the demo, Master Chief rides in a Pelican to the Earth city of New Mombasa, where he meets up with embattled UNSC Marines and battles his way through the city streets. After boarding and hijacking an enemy Ghost (a new gameplay feature added in Halo 2), Chief escapes from a pursuing Phantom dropship, only to find himself surrounded by Covenant drop pods filled with Energy Sword-wielding Elites. As he pulls out a plasma grenade, Cortana tells Chief "Bet you can't stick it," to which Chief replies, "You're on" before throwing himself at the Elites as the screen fades to white. All the while Martin O'Donnell's instantly recognizable score plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZcZk1wOuk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BqZcZk1wOuk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It made a powerful impression back in the day. In an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo community director Brian Jarrard, who previously worked at Halo 2 developer Bungie, said the stakes and energy going into E3 2003 were off the charts.</p><p dir="ltr">"The response to the demo at E3 was electric, and nearly every Halo fan remembers that demo and where they were when they were first blinded by its majesty," Jarrard said. "Best of all, none of us ever would have expected that 20 plus years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission."</p><p dir="ltr">But making the demo fully playable wasn't easy. As noted in the blog, the original demo was built on a version of the Halo engine that no longer exists and isn't compatible with other versions of Halo 2. Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said the original build of the demo required an original Xbox developer kit to boot, something "in increasingly short supply even within the studio."</p><p dir="ltr">The work to bring the demo back to life was previously announced in a Halo Waypoint <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/cutting-room-floor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> from 2022, where first details on how developer 343 Industries (now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">rebranded to Halo Studios</a>) and a group of community modders referred to as the Digsite team were working on restoring old cut content from Halo and Halo 2, including the E3 2003 demo. At the time, 343 made no promises the demo would ever become fully playable.</p><p dir="ltr">One Digsite member said some aspects of the demo were just smoke and mirrors, with the team having to make some aspects of the demo "real" by using assets from the shipped version of Halo 2. The demo, Peters said, was never made to be played off-script without breaking. That presented a unique challenge, including having to make sense of "barely documented" code "originally written under an insane time crunch" 20 years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">"This was NOT a trivial process, and we should probably layer on a whole page of caveats that come with taking a demo map for an engine that no longer exists and getting it to not blow up the current lightmapper (among other issues that come from letting people go into areas that were never intended to be seen)."</p><p dir="ltr">The Halo 2 E3 2003 demo isn't the only way Halo Studios is celebrating Halo 2's 20th anniversary. A special Halo 2 playlist in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>, featuring Halo 2 maps remade in Forge and gameplay changes made to mimic the 2004 shooter, will go live November 5.</p>

A Netflix executive is doubling down on using generative AI for video game development, even after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">shutting down a Netflix-owned gaming company</a>.</p><p>Former VP of Games Mike Verdu recently announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn</a> he's been named VP of GenAI for Games at Netflix, something he's excited to dabble in. </p><p>"At long last, I am ready to talk about what I'm doing next: I am working on driving a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI," the post read. " This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players."</p><p>Verdu, a founding member of Netflix Games, continued and touted the technology as ushering in a defining time for gamers and said he hadn't felt this excited since the 1990s. "It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.”</p><p>Buzzwords aside, it's interesting for Verdu to dive into games given that Team Blue, a Netflix-owned gaming studio, closed up shop just last month. The result was the laying off of 35 people, whose past credits include big-name, big-budget franchises like Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty. Verdu explains that was all part of the plan.</p><p>"Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games," he added. "What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition."</p><p>Verdu mentioned no plans or goals were in place since he took the position over the weekend, but insists that he's focused on a "creator-first" vision. While Team Blue has closed its doors, Netflix still owns Night School, Next Games, Spry Fox, and Boss Fight Entertainment, with over 80 games across its library with huge titles on the horizon like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a>. </p>
