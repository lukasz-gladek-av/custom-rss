Of those three titles, Towerborne will eventually make it to Xbox Series X|S, but don't get used to having Microsoft games skipping consoles. The company's gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, has indicated that this was "an anomaly" that's unlikely to be repeated.</p><p>"This is historical," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game FIle</a>. "There might always be some anomalies, but I look at those three as an anomaly. We want our games playable across as many screens as possible. We think about the Xbox platform as the Xbox console, PC, and cloud. We want all the games playable across all of those. We want them to be Play Anywhere."</p><p>While there don't appear to be any plans to bring World of Warcraft to Xbox consoles, Spencer has been bullish about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-comments-on-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation/1100-6522971/" data-ref-id="1100-6522971">sharing select Microsoft-owned titles with Sony's PlayStation</a>. The most prominent example is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, but even upcoming games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will get a PS5 release after an initial debut on Xbox consoles and PC. Spencer also mentioned his larger goal of allowing players to own a title regardless of where they're playing it.</p><p>"We want to get to the point where, when you buy, whether you're buying on cloud--which we're getting ready to introduce--buying on PC and buying on console, you own it across all of the Xbox ecosystem," said Spencer.</p>

                <p>The video game console market "isn't growing," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a new interview, and that's part of the reason why you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">don't need an Xbox to play Xbox these days. </a></p><p>"The console space all up isn't growing, across all of them [Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo]. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places," Spencer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Just because the console market isn't growing, that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning consoles. Spencer said Microsoft will "definitely do more consoles in the future," as well as "other devices."</p><p>None of this is a surprise, as Microsoft has already confirmed a next-gen Xbox that promises the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history</a>. As for the "other devices," Spencer may be referring to the Xbox handheld device that is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/" data-ref-id="1100-6527758">"few years out."</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer reiterated that Microsoft is probably not planning a mid-gen Xbox refresh, like Sony did with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>. He said, "We don't need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way?"</p><p>Years ago, the leap between the original Xbox and Xbox 360 was significant in terms of graphics and performance, Spencer said, but these days "it's harder to show the benefits" of more powerful hardware alone.</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This Is An Xbox" ad campaign</a> reminds people that Xbox is no longer limited to being a piece of plastic under your TV. Your phone is an Xbox, as is your TV, and any number of other devices, because Xbox games--and Game Pass--are available in those places. Spencer said he understands some part of the Xbox audience enjoys the "simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game." But the reality is that, "Today's largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms."</p><p>He said the Xbox platform should be about games, characters, and worlds, as opposed to any one dedicated device. "That's how we think about Xbox today," he said.</p>
