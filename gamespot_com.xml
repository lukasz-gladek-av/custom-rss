                <p>Less than a year after it launched, the story of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has been concluded with the game's final update. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/">Along with an offline mode</a>, several new Libra-themed weapons, and tweaks, Episode 8: Balance closes the curtain on this incarnation of Task Force X and quickly wraps up the story with a brief animatic. If you'd like to avoid spoilers, you can skip reading anything below the embedded video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbDSUBApBko" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qbDSUBApBko" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As revealed in the epilogue, it looks like the Justice League that the Suicide Squad succeeded in killing wasn't the real superhero team after all, but rather their clones. It turns out that Batman had planned for Harley Quinn and the gang to murder their doppelgangers all along, as while the Suicide Squad was causing chaos in Metropolis, the Dark Knight was working in the shadows to sabotage Brainiac and his multiversal counterparts.</p><p>Basically, every Justice League member is just fine--except for Wonder Woman--and with Brainiac stopped, the team is focused on saving Metropolis and the other dimensions that fell to Brainiac. As for the Suicide Squad? Thanks to their allies Hack, Lawless, and Toyman, the gang has embarked on a road trip across the Elseworlds multiverse, leaving the Arkhamverse behind. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-spoiler-not-going-over-well-with-dc-fans/1100-6520732/">Batman's controversial death</a> has been erased and the ambitious Brainiac saga has been wrapped up, closing the curtain on the game.</p><p>Released in February 2024, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-fallen-short-of-expectations-warner-bros-discovery-says/1100-6521318/">didn't live up to Warner Bros. Discovery's lofty expectations</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">The game had a $200 million impact on the company's bottom line</a>, as poor reception, lackluster post-launch content, and a sharp decline in players after launch spelled doom for the game. In comparison, NetEase's free-to-play Marvel Rivals has done very well so far, as it currently has a high number of players regularly engaged in the Overwatch-like game.</p><p>As for the future of games based on DC Comics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-games-wants-to-give-other-studios-a-chance-on-its-franchises/1100-6525635/">last year Warner Bros. Discovery revealed plans to license its IP out to third-party studios</a> and there are rumors that Suicide Squad developer Rocksteady is returning to its single-player roots with a new Arkham game.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-developer-let-go-of-more-employees-at-the-end-of-2024-report/1100-6528674/">the studio has reportedly let go of several employees</a> due to poor sales of Suicide Squad, impacting members of its programming, art, and quality-assurance teams.</p>

The latest release from heralded indie developer Heart Machine entered early access on Steam today, January 14, so this is a pretty generous launch discount.</p><p dir="ltr">While purchasing Hyper Light Breaker through Fanatical gets you an official Steam key, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam is also offering a special launch deal</a> that bundles Hyper Light Breaker with a free copy of the first entry in the series, the Zelda-inspired action-adventure game Hyper Light Drifter, for $27 (was $30). Fanatical's Hyper Light Breaker launch deal does not include the bonus Hyper Light Drifter key, but it's worth considering if you want to save some cash on the new game--especially if you already own Hyper Light Drifter. </p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-finally-launches-into-early-access-this-week-new-trailer-showcases-what-to-expect/1100-6528788/" data-ref-id="1100-6528788">early access launch trailer</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a prequel set before the events of Drifter. Players take on the role of Breakers, who are elite warriors tasked with restoring civilization by exploring an ever-changing realm called The Overgrowth and defeating the evil Abyss King who controls it. Players team up in online co-op and head out in expeditions to explore, defeat bosses, and collect loot--then return to base to upgrade the settlement with the resources you acquired, gear up, and head back out to an all-new version of the Overgrowth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649"></a><figcaption>Hyper Light Breaker</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Note that like all early access games, Hyper Light Breaker is not considered a finished game yet, and you're likely to encounter some bugs and performance issues if you dive in now.

Heart Machine is working to address performance issues and bugs as quickly as possible. AS of 5:30 PM PT, Hyper Light Breaker holds a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Mixed" review average on Steam</a> based on roughly 600 reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The initial early access version only includes a portion of the planned final content, with more playable characters, bosses, equipment types, and other additional updates planned between now and the final launch. Hyper Light Drifter's Steam page says the early access period is planned to last around a year, but that is subject to change. </p><p dir="ltr">Between making Hyper Light Drifter and Breaker, Heart Machine also launched the 3D platformer Solar Ash. While the gameplay style differs from the Hyper Light series, Solar Ash shares many of the same aesthetic elements and is worth checking out to see what else the team has made.

The series has been largely dormant since then, outside of a few Rival School character cameo appearances in other Capcom fighting games, which makes the new Complete Works artbook and Project Justice's inclusion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-fighting-collection-2-launch-edition-includes-exclusive-comic-book/1100-6528240/" data-ref-id="1100-6528240">Capcom Fighting Collection 2</a> later this year all the more exciting.</p><p>Speaking of which, preorders for the PS4 and Nintendo Switch physical editions of Capcom Fighting Collection 2 are <a href="https://amzn.to/3ZCRiN6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available now at Amazon</a> and include a limited-edition Capcom vs. SNK comic.

Along with hundreds of images, you’ll also get a detailed rundown of character profiles, world lore, and more. Considering the game has deep mythology to pull from, there should be plenty of incredible details packed between its covers. Wo Long was quite popular when it released in 2023--if you’re worried about the art book selling out, consider landing a preorder soon. Note that the final cover art has not yet been revealed.</p>                      </div><p>The book is being published by Udon Entertainment--a brand that has previously worked on art books for Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Monster Hunter. All of these earned positive reviews from readers, and The Art of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty should retain the brand’s high-quality publishing standards.</p><p>These previous volumes also make great companions for the upcoming book, and since many are currently on sale, they’re worth checking out ahead of The Art of Wo Long’s release in July.
