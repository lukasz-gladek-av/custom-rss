                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> wastes no time drawing you in. Set amid the beauty of feudal Ezo, its tale of revenge soon gives way to something deeper--a journey of healing and reflection for its protagonist, Atsu.</p><p>Revenge and grief are still powerful motivators in the game, and these are grim themes that PlayStation gamers might be familiar with, thanks to titles like The Last of Us Part 2 and God of War Ragnarok. So what is it about the cycle of violence and anguish that makes it so appealing to developers, who have all put their own stamps on these ideas?</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Ghost of Yotei lead writer Ian Ryan and creative director Jason Connell explained how Atsu's quest might have started with revenge in mind, but over the course of the game, evolved into something greater.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH3Efr6OOk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BIH3Efr6OOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>"It's about healing--revenge just sets it off"</h2><p>"I feel like there are a lot of different types of games--that even within Sony--that don't touch revenge at all, but there are some that are about revenge," Connell said. "I can't really speak to why they do it, but I will say some of the reasons why we chose it, and I think some of those will have overlap and I bet some of them won't have any at all. So, for example, it's hard to imagine that any other Sony game has been looking at a bunch of samurai films with revenge [themes] and decided that it was something that they were inspired by. But I could imagine that the second reason, we were going for a game that was going to be very open, a lot of freedom."</p><p>"I've seen people play 40 or 50 hours and haven't gotten to the second Yotei Six member. That is by design. Like we've made the game to be this way, but that really meant that we needed a very simple narrative hook that could get you, propel you into Atsu's journey, and some people are just going to go do it and find out it's a lot more than that. It's about healing--revenge just sets it off. And the people that don't, like, at least you understand that it's not like a hyper-complex thing to understand early on.</p><p>"And I do imagine that it can probably be appealing to storytellers, because storytelling is hard enough as it is, but you put it inside of a giant video game. Both progression, open-world exploration, and all these other competing elements can be really challenging. So the simplicity of it is really beautiful, and I think there's probably something that's very attractive to creators."</p><h2>"We wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player"</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726"></a><figcaption>Ezo is a land of unrivaled beauty in Ghost of Yotei.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg"></figure><p>Ryan added that themes of revenge were useful in that they allowed players to hit the ground running, keeping them engaged from the very start of the game. "It's similar in that as we're approaching the story and we know it's going to be so wide, that we just want the player to be able to keep that, track that in their head, and, and not lose sight of that kind of overriding objective and emotional core to what Atsu is going through, even as she's following the golden bird to do any number of of side stories," Ryan said.</p><p>"We also wanted a smaller opening overall so that players could engage in the gameplay and get to the open world early. And part of that means also that we wanted to players to lock into and relate to that core overriding goal. It is just such a visceral, human desire that does have deep roots everywhere."</p><p>"Everyone can relate to it--just to varying degrees--and so we wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player and create that connection with Atsu, that they could carry it out into the open world even if they decided not to engage in the revenge quest for 30 hours, because ultimately going off and doing other things is a form of healing and not getting into that obsession."</p><p>Connell and Ryan had lots more to say about the game, and if you're interested in exploring just how the memorable roster of villains--the Yotei Six led by Lord Saito--helped shape the game, you can watch the video above for fascinating insight on Ghost of Yotei's development.</p><p>"Ghost of Yotei is shaped by Atsu, its new protagonist, as you're propelled on a gripping tale of revenge amidst the backdrop of Feudal Japan's contrasting beauty and violence," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.</p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, arrives this winter, it's going to allow everyone to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">player housing</a>. Not every home is going to be created equal, but there's a way to get a leg up on your fellow players so you'll have a house full of furniture when the feature launches in early-access on December 2 for those who preorder Midnight.</p><p>Players can earn furniture by completing achievements, and it's all going to be awarded retroactively if you've already finished the ones you need. The full list of housing-related achievements was revealed on WoW's Public Test Realm, and now there's an add-on called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/home-bound" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Home Bound</a> that makes it easier for everyone to see what they have to earn.</p><p>The add-on was created by a player called Bettiold, and it lays out over 100 different items--complete with 3D decor images--that can be earned by in-game achievements. Players can even filter out achievements they've already achieved to focus on the ones that they want.</p><p>To use the Home Bound add-on, download the file from CurseForge and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Install Home Bound.</li><li>Once the game starts, type "/hb" or "/homebound" in chat.</li></ol><p>From there, players can browse achievements by category. Blizzard has previously revealed that there will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">be neighborhood-wide events</a> called Endeavors, which will allow players to work together towards a common purpose and reap the rewards for cooperation.</p><p>The Midnight expansion is also doing away with combat add-ons, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">caused some concern among players</a> because the alpha build rendered nearly every piece of combat information invisible to add-ons without giving them a viable alternative.</p>

Some problems could block your progress in select missions permanently, but there's a new patch that has addressed many of these random occurrences, so you can keep clashing steel and hunting the Yotei Six without a hitch.</p><p>The team <a href="https://support.suckerpunch.com/hc/en-us/articles/42237189337499-Patch-1-010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped the patch notes for Update 1.010</a> on Sucker Punch Productions' official website. The patch stabilizes the game by fixing two rare crashes as well as swapping out placeholder assets during a major story beat. But those are somewhat small potatoes when compared to the myriad gameplay tweaks that make the game even more playable than it already is on PS5.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Which Ghost of Yotei Mode Should You Play?</p>
      </div>
<p>For instance, your progress could be blocked during "The Way of the Kusarigama" mission if you warped into it at a specific point. Or your progress could be halted if you ignored the "armor upgrade" scene and left the area during "The Tale of the Oni" mission. Heck, your progress could be barred if you created a campsite in mission-critical stealth grass during "The Kusarigama’s Shame," didn't have flash bombs during the "Fighting Fire with Fire" mission, or--and this is very specific--saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito's goons during the "Higashi Lumberyard" mission. There are more, but you get it.</p><p>In short, many of these very random and very specific "permanent mission blocking" bugs have been ironed out.

                <p>A former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a> producer is raising the alarm on AAA development, saying that big-name publishers like Activision and Sony need to diversify their offerings more as there are great opportunities in smaller games.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/former-santa-monica-studio-boss-says-major-publishers-need-to-diversify-beyond-triple-a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> at Gamescom Asia, former Sony Santa Monica Studio co-head and director of product development Meghan Morgan Juinio (who served as a producer on 2018's God of War) expressed concern over the games industry's untenable decision-making post-pandemic. In light of the myriad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-veterans-studio-shuts-down-but-we-are-not-giving-up/1100-6535257/" data-ref-id="1100-6535257">studio closures</a> plaguing the games industry in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">the last five or so years</a>, Morgan Juinio believes that while the "payoff is potentially really large" for big publishers to continue pursuing franchises such as Call of Duty, there are also opportunities for AA and indie titles inside and outside of these series because gamers are seeking experiences that buck big-game conventions like bloated budgets, massive playtimes, and overwrought developments.</p>

<p>"I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right?" she said. "And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there."</p><p>Morgan Juinio pointed specifically to games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>--two games that fit comfortably within the AA framework due to their smaller scope, shorter development, and scaled budget. Specifically, she mentioned that these games succeeded not just because of their non-AAA connection but also because they provided captivating and innovative gameplay that was more fascinating than what some (or even most) AAA games are currently offering. Also, these two games--Astro Bot and Split Fiction--are a bit cheaper than, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which was another enticing element toward their commercial success. Consider that some analysts recently claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">no one wants to spend $100 on a game</a>, let alone one as hyped as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p><p>"What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she continued. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter how pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."</p><p>There's a lot of doom and gloom around the games industry as of late. Games are becoming more expensive. Developers are losing jobs. And, oh no, shareholders are unhappy with the sales of their expensive games. It's easy to feel defeated as someone who works in the games industry. Still, Morgan Juinio is "an eternal glass-half-full type thinker" and believes that, as long as creativity and innovation continue to persist, there will be structural changes that will benefit everyone writ large--particularly if publishers invest in smaller projects more.</p><p>"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world," she explained. "Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games."</p>
