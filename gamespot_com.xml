                <p>Platinum Games' Bayonetta made her North American debut in 2010 and she quickly became a fan-favorite character. And what's not to love? She's a shapeshifting witch who's very good at gunplay. And she almost never appears without her glasses, as insisted upon by her creator, Hideki Kamiya.</p><p>Earlier this week, a fan on <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1983682508341571921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1983682508341571921%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> asked Kamiya about a meme-worthy quote he was alleged to have said: "Bayonettaâ€™s glasses are just like her underwear." Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Kamiya attributed the quote to animation director Yuji Shimomura, who handled the game's cinematics. Kamiya also indicated that he agreed with Shimomura that Bayonetta should never be without her glasses.</p><p>"When we were designing Bayonetta, our clients requested us to take off her glasses, and it's true that I kept rejecting their proposals," recalled Kamiya. "But it's also true that, on a separate occasion, Mr. Shimomura, who produced the cinematics, said 'Bayonetta's glasses are just like her underwear--do not take them off at any cost.'"</p><p>Mari Shimazaki--the character designer of Bayonetta--posted <a href="https://twitter.com/MariShimazaki/status/1984088379362054294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984088379362054294%7Ctwgr%5E3034485e9a8241d0ba688a86118f8d542597acdd%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fautomaton-media.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2Fthe-glasses-stay-on-bayonettas-most-iconic-design-feature-was-in-danger-of-being-removed-by-publishers-but-hideki-kamiya-refused-to-compromise%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a response of her own</a> on X, and noted that Kamiya came up with Bayonetta's glasses at the earliest stages of her creation.</p><p>"During the development of Bayonetta 1, when I was drawing up rough sketches of the character design, Kamiya appeared behind me out of nowhere and whispered: 'Give her glasses.' That's how everything started. Later, whenever I was sketching rough designs for Bayonetta, he'd always come up to me saying, 'Why donâ€™t you give her glasses?' So it became a habit for me to always have a glasses layer ready in my designs. While the process of finalizing designs was sometimes a bumpy ride, I always had the glasses layer on standby."</p><p>Thus far in the games, Bayonetta has only allowed a single person to see her without her glasses. She even wears them during the 2023 prequel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bayonetta-origins-cereza-and-the-lost-demon-malice-in-wonderland/1900-6418045/" data-ref-id="1900-6418045">Bayonetta Origins: Cereza and the Lost Demon</a>.</p><p>Bayonetta 3 came out in 2022, and Kamiya subsequently hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-4-is-already-in-the-works-kamiya-announces/1100-6509360/" data-ref-id="1100-6509360">Bayonetta 4</a>. However, Kamiya left Platinum Games in 2023, and subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bayonetta-creator-hideki-kamiya-says-his-next-game-will-be-one-only-he-can-make/1100-6519976/" data-ref-id="1100-6519976">expressed his desire to make his own games</a>. The status of Bayonetta 4 is currently unknown, with Kamiya busy on Okami 2.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After 82 straight days of near-constant play, one Fortnite player has done something no one else has claimed before, as far as they know: reaching level 7,000 without cheating. The player, known as Terns on X and Canada in-game, documented the climb throughout the season, posting the milestone on social media this week.</p><p dir="ltr">The achievement, however, doesnâ€™t mean much tangible at all. Fortnite caps meaningful rewards around level 200, and higher levels donâ€™t grant extra items, bonuses, or skill advantages. The main payoff is appearing on a <a href="https://fortnite.gg/stats" rel="nofollow ">leaderboard</a> and having something to brag about--though even that isnâ€™t respectable. Terns also admitted that most of their progress came from playing against bots rather than real players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TernsCheese/status/1983319212446888292" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">22+ hours a day<br>82 days<br>7,000 levels<br>After a LOT of grinding, I've finally reached my goal and if I'm correct, the only grinder to ever reach level 7,000 legitimately without glitches or account sharing. Thank you for all your support. ðŸ§¡ <a href="https://t.co/Ap7qoiT1R1" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Ap7qoiT1R1</a></p>  â€” Terns (@TernsCheese) <a href="https://twitter.com/TernsCheese/status/1983319212446888292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 28, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"I mostly played Reload this season to get my levels," they told GameSpot. "I used 'bot lobbies,' which are an Epic-supported thing, where every enemy in your game is an AI player and it is easier to kill."</p><p dir="ltr">Ternsâ€™ post was met with ridicule across social media, with many users questioning how anyone could dedicate that much time to anything, let alone a single season of Fortnite.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thatâ€™s honestly pathetic," one commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteBattleRoyale/comments/1oiujbr/comment/nlye4ib/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a>. "Playing nearly three months with no sleep just to say no one has played as much Fortnite as you ... this is just grinding the same thing for weeks making your brain go numb so a bunch of 12-year-olds can go 'woah.'"</p><p dir="ltr">According to Terns, the upper ranks of Fortniteâ€™s leveling leaderboards are often dominated by players who use exploits to boost their stats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461" data-ratio="0.4568661971831" data-width="1136" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594461"></a><figcaption>These levels will reset at the end of the season.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4594461-screenshot2025-10-31095044.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Others are cheating to grind, and itâ€™s mostly the same few people every time," they said. "There are teams and clans of glitchers who cheat and try to ruin leaderboards and the integrity of grinding every season."</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games occasionally patches these exploits, but Terns says cheaters quickly adapt. Their drive came from a small Discord community of like-minded players who talk about leveling up for hours on end.</p><p dir="ltr">"Iâ€™m mainly motivated by talking to other grinders in my own Discord server," they said. "We often sit in voice chats together, laughing and discussing XP all day."</p><p dir="ltr">We're fastly approaching the 10-year anniversary of the launch of Fortnite battle royale and Epic's creation is still gripping players like Terns. It helps that the gaming supergiant continues to update the game with content like a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time-rewards-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6535750/" data-ref-id="1100-6535750">Simpsons-themed</a> season.</p><p dir="ltr">Terns has been playing Fortnite since Chapter 1 Season 9 and has spent years grinding for levels. After hundreds of hours and nearly sleepless nights, they've reached a level that few players--or anyone else--should pursue again.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halo: Campaign Evolved vs Halo Combat Evolved Side by Side Graphics Comparison</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Halo Leaks didn't have more details about the remakes to offer, but stated Halo Studios would be saving the return of the franchise's iconic multiplayer for Halo 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo: Campaign Evolved.when it launches in 2026, will be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">Halo franchise's first time on PlayStation</a>, where it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">continue to be released going forward</a>. If the goal of Microsoft and Halo Studios is to introduce a whole new audience and generation to Halo, starting with Combat Evolved and going through the entire original trilogy does make sense. Xbox social marketing manager Josh Stein said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-on-ps5-is-a-win-for-the-future-of-halo-dev-says/1100-6535726/" data-ref-id="1100-6535726">Halo arriving on PS5</a> "is a win for the future of Halo and those that love it, new and old."</p><p dir="ltr">Remasters aren't exactly new for the Halo franchise. Halo: Combat Evolved received its first visual remaster in 2011, and Halo 2 was remastered in 2014 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a>. Halo 3 has never been remastered or remade, making it a prime candidate for receiving a remake similar to Campaign Evolved.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that Halo: Campaign Evolved isn't out until sometime next year, it will likely still be a while before Halo Studios makes any official announcements about a Halo 2 or Halo 3 remake. In the meantime, some of the developers on the original Halo have shared their own opinions on Campaign Evolved. Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Since its first chapter launched in October 2021, Poppy Playtime has emerged as one of the premier indie horror titles in gaming, with its cute-in-a-creepy-way mascot Huggy Wuggy reaching Freddy Fazbear levels of notoriety. Today, appropriately on Halloween, Mob Entertainment has delivered a treat: The first teaser for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, the final chapter of the Poppy Playtime saga, is here.</p><p dir="ltr">The 45-second trailer shows off some of the places players will be traveling through in the latest chapter, including laboratories, medical facilities, and one area that resembles the hallway of a school. We do see a brief shadow of a gigantic spider-like being in one shot, while others feature a colorful goo stuck to the floors and walls.</p>

                <p>Looking for a fittingly eerie game to mark Halloween? Stasis, the award-winning sci-fi horror adventure from The Brotherhood, is free to claim until Monday morning over at GOG. The game combines a gruesome, story-driven narrative with classic point-and-click gameplay, inviting players to explore, combine items, and solve puzzles in a chilling, retro-inspired setting.</p><p>Set in the distant future aboard the derelict spaceship Groomlake, Stasis follows John Maracheck as he awakens from cryogenic sleep in excruciating pain, separated from his wife and daughter. With time running out and the ship sinking into Neptune's dense methane clouds, John must uncover the horrifying truth behind the facilityâ€™s experiments. The game's isometric perspective and richly detailed 2D environments create an immersive sense of dread and isolation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3eKjhTL1Zs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3eKjhTL1Zs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Stasis features a cinematic score by Mark Morgan (most notably known for his work on Fallout and Fallout 2), a slew of characters to interact with, and a range of realistic and challenging puzzles. Originally released in 2015, it won the Aggie Award for Best Adventure Game. For a limited time, players can experience the game for free, making it an ideal choice for Halloween-themed gaming.</p><p>If you're looking for more to play, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-horror-games/2900-7151/#11" data-ref-id="2900-7151">best free horror games</a>, which features everything from puzzles to creepy farm sims</p>

                <p>November is upon us, and to celebrate, Fanatical has revealed its <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fmovember-game-stache-charity-bundle-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle</a>. Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.</p><p>As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">favorite co-op games</a>--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.</p><p>Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.</p><h2>Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Schedule I</li><li>Mon Bazou</li><li>Gloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Men of War 2</li><li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dusk (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Agent Intercept</li><li>Prodigal</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal.

The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385"></a><figcaption>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg"></figure><p>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro. After the GameStop bunny picks up the titular cursed cartridge, he finds himself pulled into the game world and forced to fight for his life in this digital frontier. The game will feature multi-phase boss fights, upgradeable abilities, and even cheat codes. Priced at $45, it'll be available starting October 31. Both of these games will be available through the ModRetro store and GameStop.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594386"></a><figcaption>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594386-buck-1.jpg"></figure><p>One thing to note about these games is that even though they have ModRetro and Chromatic branding on them, they'll still work just fine on the original Nintendo hardware and other FPGA handhelds like the Analogue Pocket. In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">the ModRetro Chromatic launched not too long ago and we were very impressed</a> with just how faithfully it created and upgraded the Game Boy Color experience. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/">New stock of the modernized Game Boy also arrived earlier this year</a>, and you can choose between two models: a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass or a $300 version that's equipped with Sapphire Glass and extremely durable materials.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretros-n64-tribute-console-has-a-price-launches-later-this-year/1100-6533380/">ModRetro also announced a modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console</a> a few months back. It doesn't have a release date yet, but it does have an early-bird preorder price of $199.</p>

                <p>It seems that Square Enix is getting into the Halloween spirit and upping its fashion game. That would explain why the company behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> announced on October 31 that its long-running MMO would do away with class requirements for glamours, the game's equivalent of transmogrification.</p><p>In layman's terms, players can now use the appearance of any armor set regardless of their current class and job. That means that healers like white mages can now ditch their fancy robes and look like hulking dark knights--one of Final Fantasy 14's tank classes--and vice versa. PandÃ¦monium, indeed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fashion enjoyers, this one is for you!<br>From Patch 7.4 onward, you'll be able to equip any glamours regardless of your class/job! âœ¨<br>Mix and match your favorite outfits and slay on the battlefield! ðŸ’… <a href="https://t.co/4WogdAbGM6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4WogdAbGM6</a></p>  â€” FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In the past, Final Fantasy 14 has been fairly strict about jobs using armor that falls within their respective schools of equipment. For example, all tanking and healing jobs share gear, but things get much dicier in this regard when looking at DPS roles, especially ones that differ between ranged attack and melee. As such--as well as to differentiate players and give these jobs unique visual identities--many of these roles have exclusive weapon and armor sets.</p><p>Players are then free to turn armor and weapons that their job can use into glamours, allowing them to swap between appearances and aesthetics that they prefer while using gear that is functionally better. Now though, Square Enix is throwing open the doors to Final Fantasy 14's intense fashion-savvy crowd by getting rid of any restrictions and multiplying player's dress options tenfold.</p><p>The change, which seems to going over <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en.finalfantasyxiv.com/post/3m4ij6vvmes2z/quotes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceptionally well</a> with players, will be introduced in the forthcoming 7.4 patch, which releases on December 16. Patch 7.4, also known as Into the Mist, will also feature the next story scenario for the game post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Dawntrail</a>, as well as a new dungeon, trial, and even more endgame challenges for players to tackle.</p>
