All PS Plus members will be able to claim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/need-for-speed-unbound/" data-ref-id="5000-573450">Need For Speed Unbound</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-epic-mickey/" data-ref-id="5000-57075">Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/core-keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-533194">Core Keeper</a> starting January 6 and they will remain available until Monday, February 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628403-needforspeedunbound.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628403" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628403-needforspeedunbound.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628403"></a><figcaption>NFS Unbound promo art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628403-needforspeedunbound.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most recent Need for Speed game, NFS Unbound, has single-player and multiplayer campaigns set in Lakeshore City, which greatly resembles Chicago. Street racing is a key part of the experience, but so is outrunning the cops. As your "Heat" index rises after each race, the police will pursue players with greater intensity as they establish their rep outside of the law. Between races, players can customize their rides and compete in weekly qualifiers to get into the ultimate street racing contest: The Grand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628404-epicmickeyrebrushed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628404" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628404-epicmickeyrebrushed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628404"></a><figcaption>Mickey unleashes his paint brush in promo art for Epic Mickey: Rebrushed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628404-epicmickeyrebrushed.jpg"></figure><p>Epic Mickey was a Wii exclusive upon its 2010 debut until THQ Nordic's 2024 remaster, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, brought the game to modern consoles. The visuals and gameplay have been noticeably improved as Mickey Mouse is sucked into the Wasteland where forgotten characters and concepts have languished for decades. This game is one of the reasons why Disney made a deal to gain the rights to Walt Disney's previous creation, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. And for the first time, Mickey has to come face-to-face with his brother, Oswald, and reconcile with him if he wants any chance of escaping the Wasteland.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4628405"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Core Keeper.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4628405-corekeeper.jpg"></figure><p>Core Keeper is kind of a blend of cozy and survival games that allows players to explore a vast cavern that has hidden treasures and "untold secrets." Players can dig for the relics and resources they need to craft tools, build bases, and dive even further into the cavern. To defeat the Titans, players will have to upgrade their skills while tending to their animals, growing their own food, fishing, and even cooking in their spare time. </p><p dir="ltr">If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-december-2025/1100-6536461/" data-ref-id="1100-6536461">December's PlayStation Plus free games</a> yet, make sure to do so before Monday, January 5.
