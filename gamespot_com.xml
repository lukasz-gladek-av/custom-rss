                <p>It has come to light that the Switch 2 may include a helpful new feature for people who encounter error messages when using the console.</p><p>Someone at a recent Nintendo Switch 2 Experience event discovered that when an error message prompt pops up, the page also includes a QR code. This QR code then takes players to a support page where they can learn more about the specific issue and how to fix it.</p><p>The person who shared this on Reddit (<a href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-includes-a-helpful-new-feature-for-diagnosing-errors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Nintendosoup</a>) said while they were waiting in line to play Drag x Drive they saw one of the demo Switch 2 consoles encounter a connection error that triggered an error screen. The screen displayed the error code, an explanation of the issue, a link to Nintendo's website, and a QR code.</p><p>The person said they didn't have enough time to snap a photo but created a mockup from memory of what it looked like (below), though it's not 100% accurate.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to get more clarity on this. It sounds like a welcome and helpful feature for the Switch 2. Encountering error codes is always frustrating, so anything to potentially make the experience resolve more quickly, like a QR code with helpful instructions, sounds like a good thing.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5, priced at $450 for the system itself or $500 for a bundle that includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World.</a> Most units are sold out, but you can consult <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">GameSpot's Switch 2 preorder guide</a> to give yourself the best chance to get a console.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Texas Chain Saw Massacre - Nicotero Leatherface Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Gun Interactive says that it feels The Texas Chain Saw Massacre "has reached its full potential" and that it has been able to realize its future for the asymmetrical multiplayer game, allowing it to see its vision for this project toward its "natural" creative end.</p><p>"From the very beginning, we've always had a clear and concise vision for this game. We wanted to push the envelope on multiplayer asymmetrical horror, shed light on this iconic film to a newer generation, and place folks into the beautiful but macabre world of Muerto County and we feel we have achieved that," <a href="https://www.txchainsawgame.com/hub/tcsm-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio explained</a>.</p><p>As for the future, Gun Interactive hasn't revealed what its next project is, but it is urging fans to stay tuned.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/">One of several asymmetrical multiplayer games based on a horror movie IP</a>, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre stands apart from other games by utilizing a 4v3 structure for its gameplay, forcing survivors to keep an eye out for the chainsaw-wielding Leatherface and his homicidal family. An authentic recreation of the classic slasher movie--right down to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-texas-chain-saw-devs-went-to-extreme-lengths-to-recreate-leatherface-chainsaw/1100-6511374/" data-ref-id="1100-6511374">Leatherface's signature chainsaw</a>--the game was well-received at launch.</p><p>"As one of the year's scariest and best-designed experiences, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has reset the bar for multiplayer horror games," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-review-thrill-of-the-hunt/1900-6418102/">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre review</a>. While the game will still live on with the dedicated fans who regularly play it, the same can't be said for Evil Dead: The Game, as after a brief run, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evil-dead-the-game-has-been-mysteriously-delisted-from-several-storefronts/1100-6531206/">it was pulled from digital storefronts</a> by publisher Boss Team Games.</p>

After going over an elaborate battle plan with a "32.33, repeating of course, percentage of survival," one AFK player, a paladin named Leeroy Jenkins, bolts up and shouts "Time's up, let's do this! Leeeeroyyyy Jenkinsssss!" He runs into the adjacent room and aggroes every dragonkin in sight. Chaos ensues and internet history is made.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mLyOj_QD4a4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins instantly became an internet icon and helped cement WoW in the public consciousness, his name becoming a call to arms for anyone who was about to do something with gusto without thinking about the consequences. The video has been watched tens of millions of times in the last two decades and became a viral sensation at a time when the modern internet as we know it was still in its infancy (YouTube, for example, was just a few months old at the time of the original video). An <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HD reupload</a> of the video posted to YouTube in 2014 has racked up 26 million views alone.</p><p dir="ltr">That the whole video is staged is beside the point. The comedic writing and timing (and the absolutely absurd strategy of trying to clear out the Rookery room, rather than just avoiding the eggs entirely) was always too good to be true even before the folks behind the video openly admitted it.</p><p dir="ltr">But that is what makes the video so funny and also makes those early days of WoW so special. Here was a time before every raid strategy was known and when players hadn't quite min-maxed the fun out of encounters like this. Leeroy Jenkins blew up not because it was real, but because it was, despite its over-the-top nature, still believable as something that could happen if you joined a random UBRS group of well-meaning idiots. Such was the beauty of WoW's earliest days--something that developer Blizzard looked to recapture with its launch of WoW Classic in 2019.</p><p dir="ltr">References to Leeroy Jenkins would go on to appear in everything from a Jeopardy! question to episodes of Family Guy and How I Met Your Mother. Blizzard has immortalized Leeroy Jenkins in a number of different ways too, including an official NPC who was added to the game during the Warlords of Draenor expansion and more recently played a role in WoW's in-game 20th anniversary event. He is also on various Hearthstone cards, and Blizzard even reward's WoW players with a special title, "Jenkins," for succeeding in UBRS where Leeroy and his group failed.</p><p dir="ltr">Leeroy Jenkins continues to be an important reminder of what kind of hilarity can ensue when players don't take games too seriously and instead live in the moment. Even though his group failed miserably (on purpose), Leeroy's final words in the video still ring true today. Even in the face of ridicule and adversity, it's the fun we had along the way and the little things that matter. After all, at least he has chicken.</p>

                <p>Games Workshop has announced that the annual Warhammer Skulls livestream will return on May 22 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET, and it'll once again be hosted by Rahul Kohli. Similar to previous events, you can expect to see world premieres for upcoming games set in the Warhammer universe, as well as updates on several recently released and in-development games.</p><p>Kohli--who is a big fan of the tabletop games and voiced the protagonist Malum Caedo in 2023's Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun--will be hosting Warhammer Skulls for the third consecutive year, and Games Workshop has teased updates for titles like Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader, Total War: Warhammer 3, Warhammer 40,000: Tacticus, Warhammer 40,000: Vermintide II, Warhammer 40,000: Warpforge, and Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector.</p><p>As usual, you'll be able to watch the livestream through the official Warhammer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/warhammer">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@officialwarhammer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p>Last year only had one big Warhammer 40,000 game released in the form of Space Marine 2, but it was one of the better-received entries in the wider franchise. The game received positive reviews and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-didnt-need-to-sell-4-million-units-to-be-a-success-but-it-did-anyway/1100-6527262/">has sold over 4.5 million units as of October 24, 2024</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-will-get-several-substantial-updates-in-2025/1100-6529135/">Several big updates are still scheduled to be released</a> for Space Marine 2 throughout 2025 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/">Space Marine 3 is currently in development</a>.</p><p>Developer Saber Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-just-became-a-whole-lot-more-modder-friendly/1100-6531452/" data-ref-id="1100-6531452">also released official tools for modders</a>, giving fans to access to the same editor used by the studio to develop the game.

                <p dir="ltr">There will soon be a new compatibility rating on Steam store pages for games. Valve has announced that SteamOS hardware other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/">Steam Deck</a> will get its own checkmark, meaning the title will work with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steamos-is-coming-to-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-starting-with-lenovos-new-unit/1100-6528686/">the Lenovo Legion Go S</a> to start.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve went over what this new rating will mean <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532097310616717411">on Steam</a>, adding that roughly 18,000 games should be compatible with SteamOS from the jump. "SteamOS compatibility ratings are based on a subset of the Steam Deck compatibility testing results and are meant to show at a glance whether a game and all of its middleware is supported on SteamOS," the announcement post reads. "This includes features like game functionality, launcher functionality, and anti-cheat support."</p><p dir="ltr">From the developer side of things, Valve is saying that it doesn't need to do any extra work to ensure SteamOS compatibility for its games. The verification can happen automatically apparently based on the Steam Deck verification process. Additionally, Valve is promising that "SteamOS compatibility results will all be the same or higher than Steam Deck verified results."</p><p dir="ltr">So far, the only other SteamOS device is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lenovo-legion-go-steamos-handheld-preorders-are-live-at-best-buy/1100-6528675/">the Legion Go S handheld</a>. However, it's clear that Valve envisions this segment "expanding to more devices in the future." Meanwhile, Microsoft is reportedly teaming up with Asus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-photos-leak-as-xbox-app-gets-handheld-friendly-update/1100-6531368/" data-ref-id="1100-6531368">an Xbox-branded ROG Ally 2, which leaked</a> last week.</p>
