                <p>The developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/my-friend-pedro-review-vote-for-pedro/1900-6417173/" data-ref-id="1900-6417173">My Friend Pedro</a> has revealed its new game, Shotgun Cop Man, for PC and Nintendo Switch. In this game, Shotgun Cop Man must travel to hell and arrest Satan.</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man's main mechanic revolves around propelling the titular character using firearms across levels and platforms. Its simplistic and minimalist art style complements its chaotic gameplay, allowing players to keep track of incoming bullets while also leaving room for players to make last-minute decisions on how to evade them. Solo dev DeadToast Entertainment said that adding on extra visual flair only increased "cognitive load," leading to a decrease in gameplay flow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWSNEN2mZH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cWSNEN2mZH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I mentioned earlier the simplicity of the shotgun-propelling being something that spoke to me. And I wanted to stick with that word, simplicity, and try to make a game where I could strip away or minimize anything that wasnâ€™t contributing to that core flowy feel and experience," DeadToast explained. "Hence the minimalist look and straightforward nature of the game."</p><p>Shotgun Cop Man also includes a level editor, which was one of My Friend Pedro's most-requested features. All of Shotgun Cop Man's levels are built with the same level-editor tools that players will have access to in the full release through Steam Workshop. There will also be No Damage and Speedrun modes for hardcore players.</p><p>The game will cost $10 when it launches on PC and Switch later this year, but a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966850/Shotgun_Cop_Man/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">demo is now available on Steam</a>. It contains 17 levels for players to go through. It wasn't revealed whether Shotgun Cop Man would get PlayStation and Xbox releases, but My Friend Pedro eventually came <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-friend-pedro-comes-to-ps4-next-week/1100-6475317/" data-ref-id="1100-6475317">to all platforms</a>, so it's possible that Shotgun Cop Man will too.</p><p>It's also possible that Shotgun Cop Man will be playable on Switch 2, but it's currently unclear what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">upcoming system's backwards compatibility limitations are</a>.</p>

In addition to firefights in the main cabin, players can climb on top of the train and fire away at enemies all the way on the other side. It's an exposed position, for sure, and there is always the risk of falling off the train as well. Players are also able to climb off the train's roof and down into the conductor's cabin to sneak up on enemies who may not see them coming.</span></p><p>Activision <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/guides/blackops6/multiplayer-maps/call-of-duty-guides-black-ops-6-multiplayer-map-guide-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published an extensive blog post covering the Bullet map</a>, which includes recommendations for loadouts and gameplay tactics to give yourself the best chance to win matches and rack up kills.</p><p>Season 2 Reloaded's TMNT collaboration, meanwhile, brings the famous pizza-eating reptiles to Call of Duty, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-tmnt-skins-will-cost-you-90-to-unlock-in-total/1100-6529628/" data-ref-id="1100-6529628">costs about $90 to unlock all the new TMNT content.</a> As for the Pro Skater tease, the newly launched Grind map references some kind of forthcoming reveal, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">no big surprise given all the leaks so far. </a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a>, a new community feedback program through which the publisher aims to gather notes from fans about the state of the game.

                <p>NetEase is getting more aggressive when it comes to cracking down on the use of third-party plugins while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>. It's now banning the use of an application called Blitz, although NetEase is being lenient in that it won't ban players who previously used the software.</p><p>A notice against using third-party plugins was put out on <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/announcements/20250220/40955_1213199.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel Rivals' website</a> today, February 21. It specifically calls out Blitz, a third-party application that can be used while playing games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> to gain insight into informative data about competitive games that players can't typically see. In Marvel Rivals' case, NetEase says players using Blitz could see damage and healing statistics, predict the use of Ultimate abilities, and use it to help decide which heroes to ban in competitive play.</p><p>While it's not as aggressive as cheating software that helps players see through walls or always have precise aim, NetEase explained that "we deem this program as cheating software and will no longer allow its use during gameplay." Thankfully for the Marvel Rivals players who use Blitz, this ban is not retroactive.</p><p>"Players who have previously used this software will not face any penalties, as long as you refrain from using it in future games," NetEase explained. "To uphold justice in our gaming universe and protect the integrity of your account, we strongly urge you to refrain from using any third-party plugins. Together, we can forge a vibrant and heroic gaming environment."</p><p>Marvel Rivals is available for free on PC, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S. The hero shooter recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netease-financials-reveal-marvel-rivals-topped-40m-players-before-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">surpassed 40 million players</a> and added The Thing and Human Torch as new playable heroes today. Unfortunately, NetEase also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laid off the game's North American developers</a> earlier this week despite its success.</p>
