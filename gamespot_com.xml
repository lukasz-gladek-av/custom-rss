                <p>1047 Games announced that the open alpha test for Splitgate 2 will run from February 27 - March 2 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The alpha test includes a new 24-player multi-team experience where players can split into three groups of eight and fight against each other. In these matches, there will be two modes to play: Domination and Hotzone. In Domination, teams will have to take over and control four zones while keeping other teams out. Hotzone works similarly except there's one central zone instead of four individual ones.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHkKQMFuP4E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wHkKQMFuP4E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two additional new games modes called Splitball and Firecracker. The former combines classic capture the flag mechanics and Halo's Oddball. Players will need to hop between portals into enemy territory and steal Splitballs while defending their own home base. The latter is Spligate 2's take on the classic search &amp; destroy mode.</p><p>There are also three new maps. Glacier accommodates for 8v8v8 battles and is 20 times bigger than any map from the previous game. Bypass is a much more vertical map and Eden is filled to the brim with portal walls.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-2-excels-at-feeling-like-its-own-thing/1100-6525852/" data-ref-id="1100-6525852">Splitgate 2 preview</a>, we said, "New additions like character classes and abilities help further distinguish Splitgate 2 from a field of extremely familiar shooters."</p>

                <p>The PlayStation 5 has reached a new milestone, as Sony revealed that the console has enjoyed its best sales quarter to date. In its financial results for the three months that ended on December 31, 2024, Sony says 9.5 million PS5 consoles were shipped, and with overall sales currently at 75 million units sold, the PS5 is now almost on par with the PS4 at the same point during its lifecycle (76.5 million units).</p><p>What's interesting to note here is that these results also include the $750 PS5 Pro console bundled into them, so it's not clear yet what its sales impact currently is when compared to the regular models available at a substantially lower price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443545" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443545"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the business of PlayStation.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443545-sony-3.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443547,1300-4443548" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443547-sony-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443548-sony-5.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/" rel="nofollow ">According to Sony</a>, 42% of PS5 purchases were new users and the company also noted that even more PS4 owners are migrating to PS5. Sony says games like Astro Bot and Helldivers 2 were also successful at helping it expand into family and live-service game markets.</p><p>Sony did note that monthly active users have also risen 5% year-on-year on all platforms--up to 129 million now, with half of them being on PS4--while sales of games and consoles had increased by 16%. Overall, the games division has seen major increases as operating income increased by 37% year-over-year, thanks in part to higher profit margins on hardware and third-party games.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443544-sony-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443544" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443544-sony-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4443544"></a><figcaption>Network services revenue has increased substantially.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4443544-sony-1.jpg"></figure><p>PlayStation Plus and Network Services revenue has also increased by 20% and 28%, respectively, and the adoption of digital software has also steadily risen to 74%, a notable jump when compared to 66% last year.

                <p>Earlier this week, Sony set the stage for the rest of this year and beyond with the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a> for 2025. But while looking to the future, Sony didn't forget about the past. During the onslaught of announcements and reveal trailers, Sony noted From Software's 1997 PS1 mecha shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-review/1900-2546613/" data-ref-id="1900-2546613">Armored Core</a>, is coming to PlayStation Plus Classic Games in the near future.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-project-phantasma-review/1900-2546603/" data-ref-id="1900-2546603">Armored Core Project Phantasma</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-master-of-arena-review/1900-2545917/" data-ref-id="1900-2545917">Armored Core Master of Arena</a> are also slated to hit PS Plus Classic Games "soon," although Sony didn't set a specific date for either of those titles to arrive. The most recent game in the series was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review-mechlike/1900-6418109/" data-ref-id="1900-6418109">Armored Core 6</a> in 2023, and there hasn't been any concrete word yet about any additional sequels on the way. </p><p>In the more immediate future, the PSP game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/patapon-3-review/1900-6308897/" data-ref-id="1900-6308897">Patapon 3</a> is making the leap to PS4 and PS5 when it joins PlayStation Plus Premium on February 18. This adventure/rhythm game will feature newly enhanced visuals as well as rewind and quick save features as players lead their Patapon followers into 80 different quests.  </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dropship-united-peace-force/1900-2870144/" data-ref-id="1900-2870144">Dropship: United Peace Force</a>--which was originally released for PS2 in 2002--is also coming to PlayStation Plus Premium on February 18. Like Patapon 3, Dropship will feature rewind and quick save features, as well enhanced graphics. Dropship puts players in control of an advanced military force of land and air vehicles as they battle terrorists and organized crime across the planet.  </p><p>Among the more recent titles coming to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium on February 18 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/" data-ref-id="1900-6418060">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/top-spin-2k25-review-painting-the-lines/1900-6418222/" data-ref-id="1900-6418222">TopSpin 2K25</a>.
