                <p>In 2023, Relic Entertainment's real-time strategy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/company-of-heroes-3/" data-ref-id="5000-534671">Company of Heroes 3</a>, dived into rarely explored corners of World War 2 by letting players control Allied Forces during the invasion of Italy as well as Axis soldiers during their attempt to conquer North Africa. Later this month, Relic is adding a new Battlegroup DLC, Endure &amp; Defy, which may shake up the war during multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs, A.I. fights.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ryr8UF4SX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each of the four factions is getting their own battlegroup. The U.S. forces will have access to the Italian Partisans, a resistance group that aids their efforts behind enemy lines through sabotage, hidden tunnels, and fighters who will go into battle alongside your troops.</p><p>Germany's Wehrmacht will receive a Last Stand battlegroup that exists to slow down the Allied advance with imposing new vehicles including the Borgward Wanze and Pantherturm. The Last Stand group can also demoralize their enemy through propaganda towers, Panzerfaust rollouts, and improvised barrages.</p><p>British forces will be given backup from the Polish cavalry battlegroup, which thrives against veteran soldiers with a deep desire for revenge against the Nazis. The cavalry is equipped with heavy weaponry, Polish-crewed Sherman Fireflies, and Land Mattresses.</p><p>Deutsches Afrikakorps--aka Germany's Africa expedition force--is getting support from the German navy, the Kriegsmarine. This battlegroup can fortify positions with "catastrophic fire support" while opening up supply chains for troops. The Kriegsmarine can provide supply drops, engineering know-how, and "combat flexibility."</p><p>Company of Heroes 3 Battlegroup DLC - Endure &amp; Defy will drop November 27 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677280/Company_of_Heroes_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It's regular price is $25, but it will be offered at 10% off that price for the first two weeks. During that time, new players can also purchase the core Company of Heroes 3 game for 60% off its normal $60 price.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting a new expansion, From the Ashes, later this year to coincide with the release of James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash in theaters. Ubisoft has now shared some more information about the expansion, including its length.</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/avatar/frontiers-of-pandora/news-updates/12Y5efVFVWZwiblGQCIR1C" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> From the Ashes is estimated to include "roughly" 20 hours of content. However, how long it may take you to spend completing the content will depend on your preferred playstyle. "The overall length will vary," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Players have to own Frontiers of Pandora to play From the Ashes, but the expansion's content is accessible right from the main menu. There are no completion requirements to get started.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBW2alPp50" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JXBW2alPp50" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since Frontiers of Pandora originally came out back in 2023, some people might want to be reminded of the story before playing From the Ashes. To that end, Ubisoft created a "short recap video" that people can watch to get up to speed.</p><p>The $25 expansion launches on December 19, which is the same day the movie Fire and Ash hits theaters. Players need a copy of the base game to play, or they can buy the $40 Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base game and the DLC.</p><p>Ubisoft is also selling a Complete Edition of the game for $60, and it includes the main game, the From the Ashes expansion, and the Season Pass.</p><p>In From the Ashes, you play as So'lek, and the story is about grief and vengeance, Ubisoft said. A free update coming to Frontiers of Pandora on December 5 will add a third-person mode, but the From the Ashes content can be played in either first- or third-person.</p><p>Ubisoft will broadcast a deep dive for From the Ashes on November 20, so check back soon for more.</p>
