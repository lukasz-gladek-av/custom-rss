Assuming it's styled for America, this would point to March 4, 2025. Exactly what could happen on that day, however, is unknown. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">previously reported that a new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater remaster would launch this summer</a>, and if that's true, then March 4 could be when the game is revealed or at least teased further. </p><p>Tony Hawk himself <a href="https://x.com/tonyhawk/status/1892622967579832757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">chimed in about the tease with the eyes emoji</a>, suggesting this is indeed real and some kind of announcement is forthcoming.</p><p>The Grind multiplayer map first debuted in 2012's Black Ops 2. A remastered version is out now as part of the Season 2 Reloaded update with a fresh coat of paint and this apparent THPS teaser.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawkâ€™s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6â€™s Grind MP map!<br>Announcement on March 4. ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In other skateboarding news, the Season 2 Reloaded update adds a new melee weapon in the form of a skateboard that you can whack someone over the head with to take them down with one hit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186"></a><figcaption>Smack your enemies with a skateboard in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg"></figure><p>Recently, real-life pro skater <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">Tyshawn Jones claimed that he was in an upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> game even though Activision had not announced a new one yet.

                <p>Funcom has announced that its MMO survival game, Dune: Awakening, will launch for PC on May 20. The game is also slated for a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launch, but a release date for those versions hasn't been revealed yet.</p><p>In this iteration of the Dune universe, the main protagonist Paul Atreides was never born. Players assume the role of a prisoner sent to Arrakis to uncover the mystery around the Fremen's disappearance. Along the journey, players will rise from being a nameless survivor to either becoming an agent of the Atreides or the Harkonnen.</p><p>The game will cost $50 and those who preorder will receive a decoration called the Terrarium of Muad'Dib that they can place in their bases.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl6Wi20fSp0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also download the character creator and benchmark tool to receive a special code to redeem a Frameblade Knife at launch. Characters can be saved and imported to the full game, and the benchmark tool lets players know if their hardware can run it. While Funcom hasn't revealed the full specification requirements, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> notes that it requires a 64-bit processor and operating system at least.</p><p>Dune: Awakening features an ever-changing open-world desert that shifts every week, and players can explore new locations and rewards. There will be server-wide politics in the form of Landsraad decrees, where every player will be impacted whether they're aligned with Altreidas or Harkonnen.</p><p>While the game is multiplayer, players can choose to experience the storyline alone, and PvP is always optional. Players can also sign up for the beta on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">game's official website</a>.</p><p>Dune: Awakening's unique world will also have players being able to team up with characters who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-mmo-will-let-players-team-up-with-characters-who-are-dead-in-the-book/1100-6511909/" data-ref-id="1100-6511909">are dead in the book series</a>, and Funcom is "rethinking" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-rethinking-survival-game-staples-according-to-new-interview/1100-6511865/" data-ref-id="1100-6511865">survival game mechanics</a> and staples with this game.</p>

Hasbro announced this week that Saber Interactive will be bringing one of its "tentpole IPs" to life as a "AAA" game.</p><p>"We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games," Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said during an investor's call (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/526330/hasbro-saber-interactive-40k-space-marine-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>). "Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's mega-hit, Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2. Combining high-octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm tech, this new AAA title, based on one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit."</p><div tabindex="0"

project. The Warhammer 40K sequel was developed by Saber St. Petersburg, which is one of several subsidiaries owned by the company. As for the IP that Saber will be adapting, that remains a mystery for now, as Hasbro owns multiple brands like Transformers, GI Joe, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic the Gathering, My Little Pony, and Peppa Pig.</p><p>This is also one of several video game projects in development, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/">Invoke Studios is working on a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, Atomic Arcade is handling a GI Joe spin-off starring Snake Eyes, and Austin-based studio Skeleton Key is working on a mystery project. A Transformers game would likely be a good fit for Saber, as this is one IP that fans of the franchise have been requesting to see more of.</p><p>While Transformers hasn't been dormant in the video game space, recent releases like Galactic Trials and Earthspark Expedition haven't quite managed to scratch the itch for Autobot action in the same way that games like War for Cybertron or Transformers: Devastation did when they were released back in the 2010s.</p><p>Sadly, one promising Transformers game, Transformers: Reactivate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-reactivate-canceled/1100-6528693/">was canceled earlier this year</a> after having been in development at British studio Splash Damage.</p>

GTA 5 for PC is getting a major upgrade, with Rockstar Games bringing over the changes, improvements, and additions from the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions.</p><p>On March 4, everyone who owns GTA 5 on PC will be able to access the upgrade for free, with all story mode and online progress supported. There are some key things to know, including that anyone whose hardware does not meet the minimum requirements (below) can keep playing the existing version of GTA 5 on PC, but it will be a separate instance. People on that version will not be able to play together with those running the upgraded version, but support for the older edition will remain.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447149-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.32am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447149" data-ratio="0.56151711378353" data-width="1081" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447149-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.32am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447149"></a><figcaption>GTA 5 on PC is getting a big upgrade.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447149-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.32am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447150-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.40am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447151-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.48am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447152-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.55am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447153-screenshot2025-02-20at11.21.01am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4447150,1300-4447151,1300-4447152,1300-4447153" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4447150-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.40am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4447151-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.48am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4447152-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.55am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4447153-screenshot2025-02-20at11.21.01am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447150-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.40am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447151-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.48am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447152-screenshot2025-02-20at11.20.55am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447153-screenshot2025-02-20at11.21.01am.png"></figure><p>If you don't already own GTA 5 on PC, you can grab it through GameSpot sister site Fanatical via the link below.
