As a bonus, select plans also include an up to $50 Amazon gift card if you keep your subscription for at least 31 days. The deal only applies to NordVPN's 2-year plans, which require you to pay in full at sign-up, and the discount and Amazon gift card amount change depending on which plan you buy. Here's a look at the options:</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>NordVPN 2-Plan Deals</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Basic</strong> -- $81.36 for the first 24 months (normally $278.16 per 24 months)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Plus</strong> -- $105.36 for the first 24 months (normally $359.76 per 24 months) - Also includes $20 Amazon gift card</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Complete</strong> -- $129.36 for the first 24 months (normally $439 per 24 months) - Also includes $40 Amazon gift card</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prime</strong> -- $177.36 for the first 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months) - Also includes $50 Amazon gift card</li></ul><p>While all four 2-year NordVPN plans are discounted, only the Plus, Complete, and Prime plans include Amazon gift cards. Each plan includes differing features, which we've outlined below.</p><p>Note that the discounted price only applies to the first 24-month purchase. After the promotional period, all subscriptions roll over to the full standard price unless you cancel ahead of time. NordVPN also offers a full 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you change your mind within the first month of service, you can cancel for a full refund. However, the Amazon gift card bonus is only delivered if you keep your 2-year Plus, Complete, or Prime plan for 31 days.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that NordVPN also offers annual and monthly subscription options, although these plans aren't as steeply discounted and do not include the Amazon gift card freebie.</p><h2>NordVPN plan features</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516454"></a><figcaption>NordVPN</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4516454-nordvpn.jpg"></figure><p>All four NordVPN plans include different features and benefits, starting with simple VPN and DNS services for the Basic plan, and up to 1TB of cloud storage and bonus cybersecurity protections for the more expensive plans.

EA and developer Full Circle have announced that the next Skate playtest is coming in early July, and it's arriving with a big visual upgrade.</p><p>As related in a new edition of <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1935024659092632040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Grind</a>, Skate's new update 0.27.0 will coincide with the next playtest on July 2. Invites will be sent out in waves for players who are signed up as Skate Insiders before June 27. After that date, registration will be closed. The new update has dramatically improved lighting, shadows, and visuals for the city of San Vansterdam, as well as more environments, animations, sound effects, graffiti, traffic, and pedestrians.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516389"></a><figcaption>A side-by-side look at Skate's previous build and the newly upgraded visuals in the new update.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4516389-skateupdate.jpg"></figure><p>Full Circle has increased the maximum number of players per server to 150, and adjusted the in-game map to show the locations of other players. New missions and challenges are available in the new playtest, as is the Market Mile neighborhood, and progression has been overhauled.</p><p>Full Circle also revamped the tutorial to introduce the city much sooner than it did before. As players level up, their in-game reward boxes will offer better prizes. Players who want to customize their characters' appearances will see several new options for clothing, hair, gestures, and emotes.</p><p>The development team noted that it expects Skate to enter early access at the end of this summer. Full Circle recently revealed that because of the size of the city, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">Skate will require a constant internet connection</a> to play.</p><p>Skate will be free-to-play on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, but it doesn't currently have a release date.</p>
