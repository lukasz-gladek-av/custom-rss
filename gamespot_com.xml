                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 celebrates its fifth anniversary today, December 10, as the RPG originally launched back on December 10, 2020. It's been a busy, tumultuous five years for the game, and now one of the game's designers, Pawel Sasko, has weighed in with a <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1998772126317220142" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">heartfelt message</a> to mark the milestone.</p><p>"I feel nothing but gratitude towards each one of you," he said. "I feel so thankful to be part of this community. I love all the pictures, videos; all the cosplay and mods that you have done for Cyberpunk 2077. It has been an incredible adventure."</p><p>He added: "I hope you have enjoyed the stories we have told about the characters we have built. I feel so blessed to be part of this community. I feel so thankful to be able to work on this game and to add something valuable to your lives."</p><p>Another developer, Bartek Pyrko, <a href="https://x.com/BartPyrko/status/1998737046739857431" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "I'm deeply proud to have been part of the team that shaped Night City. The project changed me--as a designer and as a person--and being my first project at CDPR, it became a defining and unforgettable chapter of my career."</p><p>When Cyberpunk 2077 launched in December 2020, it was in such a rough state, technically, that it was removed from sale from the PlayStation Store. Thousands of people got refunds.</p><p>CD Projekt pledged to update, fix, and improve Cyberpunk 2077 following its troubled launch, and the Polish developer did just that. The game later got into much better shape, culminating with the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/" data-ref-id="1100-6517704">Cyberpunk 2077's 2.0 update in 2023</a> that re-worked a number of gameplay systems, alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phantom-liberty-rewrites-cyberpunk-2077s-dna/1100-6515050/" data-ref-id="1100-6515050">Phantom Liberty expansion.</a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 has gone on to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-hits-35-million-sales-and-did-so-faster-than-witcher-3/1100-6536532/" data-ref-id="1100-6536532">more than 35 million copies</a>, reaching that sales milestone faster than The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game expanded to a new platform, Switch 2, earlier this year. Unsurprisingly, a sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a>, is now in the works.</p><p>Beyond that, CD Projekt just recently announced an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-is-getting-an-official-physical-trading-card-game-in-collaboration-with-cd-projekt-red/1100-6536818/" data-ref-id="1100-6536818">official Cyberpunk Trading Card Game</a>. It features characters from Cyberpunk 2077 and the Netflix series Edgerunners, with a Kickstarter campaign for it coming in 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Apple has revealed the most-downloaded games on iPhone and iPad for this year, as well as the top Apple Arcade titles.

Meanwhile, Minecraft claimed the top spots for paid iPhone and iPad games.

                <p>The Fortnite collabs look like they could be off to a strong start next year, with leaks suggesting that a Bleach crossover is coming. According to the leaks, it's set to launch in early 2026 during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-all-weapons-and-loot/2900-7294/" data-ref-id="2900-7294">Chapter 7 Season 1</a>. Since the season is set to end on March 4, the most likely release window is January or February.</p><p>First spotted by noted dataminer SamLeakss, the collab could feature not just a character skin but also Ichigo's theme, "Number One." So the skin seems likely to be Ichigo himself.</p><p>Fortnite has been packed with collaborations lately, incorporating characters and icons from various worlds. In the past year alone, players have seen crossovers with horror legend Ghost Face, the viral Skibidi Toilet meme, Metal Gear Solid's Snake, and even recent pop-culture giants like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kpop-demon-hunters-x-fortnite-adds-skins-gameplay-items-and-their-own-demon-hunting-mode/1100-6535150/" data-ref-id="1100-6535150">KPop Demon Hunters</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/fortnite-x-squid-game-official-island-escape-trailer/2300-6466244/" data-ref-id="2300-6466244">Squid Game</a>.</p><p>Anime crossovers have been especially popular with players. Fortnite has already teamed up with major series such as Naruto, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dragon-ball-super-crossover-all-skins-weapons-and-more/1100-6506500/" data-ref-id="1100-6506500">Dragon Ball</a>, Attack on Titan, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-jujutsu-kaisen-crossover-adds-new-skins-and-tons-of-free-cosmetics/1100-6516642/" data-ref-id="1100-6516642">Jujutsu Kaisen</a>, each bringing fan-favorite skins, themed items, and special gameplay features. With these collaborations being so successful, it makes sense that Epic Games would pursue another major anime name, such as Bleach. However, nothing is confirmed yet, so we'll have to wait until Epic Games officially announces the crossover.</p>
