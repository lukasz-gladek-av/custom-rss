The trailer also introduces all eight guests included in Friends of Jimbo 3, which range from indie hits to robust RPGs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r1LVgAGXlE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1r1LVgAGXlE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The list of games included in the Balatro Friends Of Jimbo 3 pack is below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Divinity: Original Sin 2</li><li dir="ltr">Donâ€™t Starve</li><li dir="ltr">Enter the Gungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Cult of the Lamb</li><li dir="ltr">1000x Resist</li><li dir="ltr">Potion Craft</li><li dir="ltr">Shovel Knight</li><li dir="ltr">Warframe</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Balatro is a roguelike deckbuilder where players use traditional playing cards to score as many points as possible against "blinds."
