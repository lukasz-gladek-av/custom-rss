                <p>In PlayStation's February 2025 State of Play, Supermassive Games announced that The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020 is releasing on October 2 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Directive 8020 follows a crew on a spaceship called Cassiopeia, which is on a journey to find a new home for humanity. It crash-lands on the planet of Tau Ceti f, which is 12 light-years away from Earth. The crew on the ship is brought out of hypersleep early and each of them must survive an unknown alien threat.</p><p>One of the crew members, Brianna Young, is portrayed by Lashana Lynch, who is best known for playing Maria Rambeau in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as well as roles in Bob Marley: One Love and The Woman King.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a_VXgNSfME" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4a_VXgNSfME" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like the franchise's previous entry, The Devil in Me, players will be able to use a variety of tools in Directive 8020, including a new scanner. The scanner is used to detect aliens that can mimic the appearances of Cassiopeia's crew. There's also a screwdriver that can be used to distract enemies by activating electronic devices nearby. A new utility strap on the characters' wrists can be used to control a flashlight, but the aliens will be able to spot it, so players will need to be careful.</p><p>Directive 8020 is the latest entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology and takes inspiration from other media such as The Thing, with a mix of both stealth and horror.</p>

                <p>Sony Bend's open-world action-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> is getting the PS5 remaster treatment that the publisher has used with several of its first-party games this generation. Days Gone Remastered was previously rumored to exist in 2024, but now it's official, and players who own the PS4 version can upgrade to the PS5 version for $10.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ARn0H6HXA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D1ARn0H6HXA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Days Gone's PS5 features include several upgrades, such as improved draw distance, stronger graphical fidelity, better lighting and shadows, 3D audio (so you can hear those hordes of Freakers better, no doubt), and VRR support on compatible screens.</p><p>Naturally, it will also enjoy DualSense support, with haptic feedback and adaptive triggers meant to provide a more immersive sense of the "Broken Road" on your bike, as well as capturing weather effects like rain and thunder. Another staple of PS5 remasters, Days Gone will also include new accessibility features, including "Contrast mode, Game Speed, UI Narration, Collectible Audio Cues, Controller Remapping, Field of View slider, and more."</p><p>New modes are coming to the PS5 version, too. Horde Assault is billed as a "survival arcade mode" that sounds a bit like Call of Duty Zombies, with an emphasis on lasting as long as you can rather than reaching a definitive end point. A new permadeath mode will also give hardcore players a one-life-to-live stipulation for the most authentic apocalyptic experience. There will also be a new speedrun mode that pushes you to beat the story as quickly as you can.</p><p>Photo mode is also being overhauled to throw in more features such as time-of-day settings, new lighting rigs, and new logo options.</p><p>Days Gone Remastered arrives on April 25 for PS5, with the game's new content mentioned above coming to the PC version as the Broken Road DLC bundle. This was one of many announcements during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">February 2025 State of Play</a> presentation.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a> is a dark, melee-focused combat game set in a war-torn country, featuring tons of monsters and tough combat, and it's launching on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on September 4. While the focus seems to be on war, the trailer also features tons of sci-fi and horror elements, to create a surreal atmosphere.</p><p>The new trailer shows the main character, Rémi, and his trusty sidekick, a drone, exploring the war-torn countryside and villages, interacting with survivors, and fighting off monsters. While there are plenty of gruesome images showing the devastation of the war, there are also sci-fi monsters, like a white figure with no face, and an evil business man with a ridiculous-looking chin.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s_oHQYBoJA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2s_oHQYBoJA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Detailed in a press release, Rémi will be voiced by Elias Toufexis, an actor who has appeared in multiple TV shows and is best known for voicing Adam Jensen in Deus Ex. Hell is Us is described as an action-adventure game focused on exploration, but without pesky map markers and quest lists. The game will use an approach called Player-Plattering, meant to incentivize players to follow their own instincts in exploration and discover new objectives and areas on their own. Rémi will need to discover the origins of the mysterious monsters in the region, which have started appearing amidst the destruction caused by the war.</p><p>Hell is Us launches on September 4 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
