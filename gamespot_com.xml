The developers put out a new trailer today showing off some of the zany things people can build using Portal, but when Battlefield 6 gets into the hands of a big audience, we can only imagine the kinds of things people will build using the tools.</p><p>Community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/1971245786362257645" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, "Truly looking forward to seeing this level of power in your hands for the first time in Battlefield." Johnson added that the last iteration of Portal only "scraped the surface," but Battlefield 6's Portal mode gives players a lot more freedom.</p><p>Johnson said it might be a fan who comes up with the next Rush or Conquest, referring to Battlefield's best-known modes.</p><p>As you can see in the new trailer posted today, your imagination seems to be the limit of what you can make in Battlefield 6's Portal mode. As an example, we see tanks falling from the sky to create falling missiles that players have to avoid while riding ATVs. That's just one possibility of what people can make.</p><p>Battlefield 6's Portal mode will also allow players to earn XP, and players will be able to find custom games and modes through the game's server browser.</p><p>A bigger investment in Portal for Battlefield 6 is no big surprise. After all, EA CEO Andrew Wilson has said the company wants to <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/user-generated-content-key-to-eas-growth-strategy-towards-over-one-billion-players/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lean into user-generated content</a> to fuel the company's growth in the future, and it seems Portal will be part of that.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

                <p>EA's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> is finally playable for everyone via free Early Access. Although the skateboarding feels good, most players don't love the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>-ification (or the copious microtransactions and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">Sims</a>-esque looking character models) of the iconic skate sim. The developers at Full Circle have heard these complaints about the high-contrast visuals and, with the imminent launch of Season 1, will address the game's look to feel "more grounded and lived in."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1971259590667899153" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lengthy X post</a>, Full Circle reiterated that the look of the game is ever-evolving. Referencing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an August 15 blog</a>, where the team promised that Skate's aesthetic would improve to add "even more detail and personality," Full Circle revealed what this "detail and personality" will start to look like when Season 1 drops on October 7.</p>

      </div>
<p>The change, as part of update .28 arriving on the same day as Season 1, gives San Vansterdam a "more grounded and lived in" feel. What Full Circle showed off was a drop in contrast, washing the world in a golden glow. The team said this is "San Van at 'Golden Hour.'"</p><p>"While this is only Step One of what will be an ongoing development of the game’s visuals, we want to give you a sneak peek today," Full Circle posted on X. "And once this update releases [on October 7], we want your feedback so we can keep improving and iterating."</p><p>That's in the more immediate future. Looking ahead into December and beyond, Seasons 2 and 3 (and...beyond) will introduce new content such as customization items, "legacy game modes" from the Skate franchise, challenges, seasonal events like Skate-o-Ween and the 7 Ply Maple Harvest, and party voice chat, alongside quality-of-life improvements and more additions. That does include new tricks, with Season 2 adding impossible and improved handplants while Season 3 brings darkslides and improved footplants. That's sick.</p><p>What's really sick, though, is that you don't have to pay for them. Yes, Seasons 1, 2, and 3 (and beyond) will always introduce some microtransactions--particularly thanks to the imminent inclusion of the Skate Pass--however, when new tricks drop, your wallet stays closed.</p><p>"You will never have to pay for new tricks," Full Circle reiterated in a Q&amp;A towards the end of its X post. "As we add new tricks to skate., you’ll have access to them as soon as they come to the game (update may be required), and they’ll become part of Challenges to help keep up your skill. Once added, a trick will never go away."</p><p>Still, it's hard to tell if any of these updates will assuage the skateboarding community. The game currently sits at a "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mixed</a>" rating on Steam (with over 22,000 reviews at the time of this writing) and some scathing criticism from gaming outlets like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skate-early-access-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sports/the-new-skate-feels-like-it-was-made-by-people-in-suits-rather-than-people-with-skateboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. It might not look realistic, but at the very least, the skateboarding to enjoyable.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/">Hades 2</a> has officially launched in full, and the day-one patch notes reveal just how far the game has come since it started its early-access journey. Currently available for PC and Switch consoles, the 1.0 version of Hades arrives with a substantial number of changes to the game, ranging from minor tweaks to new additions that'll keep you exploring the Underworld for hours on end.</p><p>Some of the biggest highlights here include the true ending of the game, so if you want to see how Princess Melinoe's story really concludes, you'll want to go give Chronos a good kicking. Supergiant Games added that this ending will not change key events in the game, and earning it will unlock the final Vow of Rivals rank. Getting to that ending is quite the achievement, and one that will be celebrated with some digital kudos, as 50 different achievements have been unlocked as well.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p>You do not need to start the game over to earn any achievements, so once you load it up, you may be pleasantly surprised to find these retroactively added to your account. Players can also expect new artwork--like visual effects, environmental art, and other visual improvements--new music to listen to, more decorations to liven up the Crossroads, and even more Keepsakes to collect. Beyond that, there are scores of tweaks to virtually every part of Hades 2, from combat to character animations and much more.</p><p>If you feel like scrolling through the lengthy patch notes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can click this link to read</a> about every change, big and small.</p><p>"Hades 2 exits early access as a finely-honed and deeply engaging roguelite that builds upon the strong foundations established by the first game," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review</a>. "It's larger in every way, with more characters and conversations to enjoy, an entirely new roster of weapons to learn, and deeper customization options to its expanded combat system, yet none of these upgrades compromise Hades' legacy. Rather, Hades 2 improves upon its predecessor in every way, making it a masterfully crafted sequel that is essential to play."</p><p>If you're looking to dive into one of the best games of 2025, you can check out GameSpot's guides on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-best-endgame-build-tips/1100-6534896/" data-ref-id="1100-6534896">best Hades 2 endgame builds</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-soot-where-to-find-wake-up-hypnos-soundest-of-sleepers/1100-6534788/" data-ref-id="1100-6534788">where to find soot to wake up Hypnos in Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-melinoe-seek-us-riddles-where-to-locate-three-fates/1100-6534873/" data-ref-id="1100-6534873">where to locate the three Fates in Hades 2</a>.</p>

                <p>A major new patch for Borderlands 4 has arrived, adding the promised field of view (FOV) slider on console, making stability and performance improvements, and tweaking some rewards and progression elements.</p><p>It's a beefy patch, but it's not the end of Gearbox's ongoing support, as the developer also said there were "too many" buffs for Vault Hunters to fit into this update, so these changes are coming in their own balance update that is <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1971250703239901643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">targeting release early next week.</a> That said, this newest patch does indeed contain Vault Hunter changes and balance adjustments for Harlowe the Gravitar, Amon the Forgeknight, Vex the Siren, and Rafa the Exo-Soldier. You can see the specific changes in the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes below</a>.</p><p>Since Borderlands 4 launched earlier this month, players on console and PC have complained about stability and performance issues, and this patch addresses both of those concerns. It also addresses instances of crashes, hitching, and low FPS. Gearbox said it's work continues and it will make "further improvements to stability and performance" in the future.</p><p>For the FOV slider on console, Gearbox said people should know that increasing the FOV beyond the default settings may cause "dips in performance."</p><p>The technical issues with Borderlands 4 prompted Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">post through it</a>, but he's since moved on to <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1970925490556002363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting a lot about the upcoming Now You See Me movie sequel</a>. Pitchford contributed to the magic elements of the movie and says he was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-more-involvement-now-you-see-me-borderlands-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more involved with that film that the Borderlands movie.</a></p><p>This patch, like any patch for any game, isn't expected to fix every last issue you may be experiencing, but work continues on additional patches to come over time.</p><p>In other Borderlands 4 news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">Switch 2 edition has been delayed indefinitely and all digital preorders are being refunded. </a></p><h2>Borderlands 4 September 25 patch notes</h2><h2><strong>Weekly Activities:</strong></h2><ul><li>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</li><li>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

Following two main Spider-Man games and the Miles Morales game, the studio's next project is one that has Marvel fans excited as a legendary mutant is stepping back into the spotlight.</p><p>The last time that Wolverine had a solo game was all the way back in 2009 with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. A tie-in game to the film of the same name, Raven Software's single-player adventure was a gruesome and action-packed spectacle of blood, guts, and adamantium claws. More than a decade later, Insomniac's take on the X-Man is looking like a spiritual successor, and while the game is still deep in development, a few new details about Marvel's Wolverine have been revealed recently.</p><h2 id="When_will_Marvel_s_Wolverine_be_released_">When will Marvel's Wolverine be released?</h2><p>As revealed during the September 2025 State of Play, Marvel's Wolverine will be popping its claws in Fall 2026. </p><p>Insomniac is something of a miracle worker when it comes to video game releases, as since 2018, the studio has shipped Marvel's Spider-Man, expansive DLC for the game, Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, with Spider-Man 2 launching in October 2023. Insomniac has a reputation for surprisingly short development cycles in the current era of multi-year game projects, and it has been suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-will-be-m-rated-game-could-launch-as-early-as-fall-2024-report/1100-6511117/">Marvel's Wolverine could launch in Fall 2024</a>. That didn't happen, of course, and most recently, Insomniac <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolverine-dev-refuses-to-comment-on-2025-release-date-acknowledges-pent-up-excitement/1100-6528944/" data-ref-id="1100-6528944">refused to comment when asked if Wolverine is coming in 2025.</a></p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_platforms">Marvel's Wolverine platforms</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, Marvel's Wolverine will be headed to PlayStation 5 as a console exclusive, given Insomniac's position as a PlayStation first-party studio<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-sony-bought-insomniac-games-we-felt-that-this-/1100-6469237/" data-ref-id="1100-6469237"> since its acquisition by Sony in 2019</a>. It's highly likely that the game will eventually come to PC, as several other Insomniac-developed titles have also wound up on that platform following their PS5 release.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_gameplay">Marvel's Wolverine gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQXgLjwdM98" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sQXgLjwdM98" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wolverine isn't the kind of hero who wins a fight with quips and hugs, and naturally, Insomniac wants to create an experience <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-trailer-reveals-2026-release-window-and-very-bloody-gameplay/1100-6532076/" data-ref-id="1100-6532076">that feels fast and ferocious</a>. The studio says its aiming to create "the ultimate Wolverine fantasy" and enhance that vicious combat with action-packed set pieces and a gripping story. The first gameplay trailer hinted at this savage side of Wolverine, as the X-Man was using his adamantium claws to impale enemies, rip them apart, and brutally dismember them.</p><p>As for the tone of the game, Insomniac is aiming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-will-be-full-sized-and-mature-in-tone/1100-6496210/">deliver a mature experience</a>, which is fitting considering Wolverine's nature as a walking weapon. Insomniac's recent games have also been showcases of slick action, so there's a good chance that the studio will deliver some cutting-edge gameplay with Wolverine that's balanced by the developer's ability to dig deep into the emotional core of its characters.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_story">Marvel's Wolverine story</h2><p>Insomniac isn't sharing too many details on what the storyline for Marvel's Wolverine will be, but the studio did tease that it will be original take on the character to uncover the secrets of a dark past that has eluded him. </p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_actor">Marvel's Wolverine actor</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6cSbKIwGWQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P6cSbKIwGWQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To bring Logan to life, Insomniac recruited Australian actor Liam McIntyre to voice the character and provide motion capture for him. McIntyre has a long list of acting credits, and he's best known for playing the lead role of Spartacus in the TV series Spartacus: Vengeance. He also has extensive voice-acting experience, having voiced characters like Captain Boomerang and Aquaman in several DC animated films.</p><p>"Fans out there know what Wolverine is, who he is," McIntyre said in a dev diary video. "My job is to try to find the essence of who Wolverine is--especially as to how it applies to our story. People hurt him, people take from him, people betray him, [but] he still fights for people who can't fight for themselves."</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_cameos">Marvel's Wolverine cameos</h2><p>It wouldn't be a Marvel game without a few familiar faces, and Marvel's Wolverine has at least two recognizable ones: The treacherous shape-shifting mutant Mystique and one of Logan's deadliest enemies, Omega Red. Logan will also be going up against the Reavers, an army of criminal cyborgs who have menaced him and the X-Men for decades in the comics, and the trailer hinted at a fight with a Kaiju-sized Sentinel, the infamous mutant-hunting robots.</p><h2 id="Marvel_s_Wolverine_screenshots">Marvel's Wolverine screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574751"></a><figcaption>Marvel's Wolverine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574751-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%286%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574752,1300-4574753,1300-4574754,1300-4574755,1300-4574756,1300-4574757,1300-4574758,1300-4574759,1300-4574760,1300-4574761,1300-4574762,1300-4574763" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574752-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574753-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574754-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574755-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574756-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574757-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574758-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%289%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574759-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2810%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574760-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2811%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574761-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2812%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574762-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2813%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4574763-marvel%E2%80%99swolverine%2814%29.jpg"></figure>
