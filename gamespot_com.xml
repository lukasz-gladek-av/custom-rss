                <p>A new report alleges that PC hardware company NZXT's PC rental program is "shady and manipulative." The video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamers Nexus</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) accuses NZXT of changing prices and parts between "purchase" and "rental" versions of prebuilt PCs with the same (or similar) names.</p><p>For context, NZXT's Flex program allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 (though a renter would need to provide a monitor, keyboard, and mouse). Gamers Nexus claims that specs and prices of prebuilt PC models change depending on whether you select "buy" or "rent." The exact prices and specs can change "day to day" according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0pomC1CfpC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For example, the video shows that a "Player: Three Prime" model PC contained an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if a customer was set to buy it, whereas the rental version contained an RTX 4080 Super. However, the performance estimates--showing expected frame rates in certain games--did not change between the two models, despite containing significantly different hardware. These specs allegedly changed multiple times while Gamers Nexus was completing its report.</p><p>The Flex program's alleged issues don't stop there. Gamers Nexus highlights the Flex program's price point. Within nine or so months, the price of renting one of NZXT prebuilds will outstrip the cost of buying the PC (or its component parts) outright, with no rent-to-own option. Additionally, the report calls outs the program's "aggressive" terms of service, which allegedly allow NZXT to sell data created or stored on the rented PC.</p><p>NZXT has released a response on <a href="https://x.com/NZXT/status/1863388904205799769" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter,</a> which states, "We are aware of the recent claims made against us and are actively reviewing the situation. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing this thoroughly and will share an official statement soon. Thank you for your patience as we work to provide clarity."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tencent has unveiled its latest creation--an open-world survival game called Light of Motiram--and although the game's recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfAuAQw48oc">released trailer</a> is visually stunning, viewers can't help but notice <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1w4rv/tencent_announced_light_of_motiram_and_it_looks/" rel="nofollow ">the game bears a striking resemblance</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in an ancient-yet-futuristic open world where players must craft items, maintain survival stats, and battle strange robotic beasts called Mechanimals, Light of Motiram certainly seems to be riffing on the Horizon aesthetic. The game's environments, polygonal robot creatures, and even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1h2exs6/comment/lzjexag/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">its tall grass</a> all seem to be heavily inspired by the Horizon playbook, but Light of Motiram seems to have drawn inspiration from other games as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408285-stolengrass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408285" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408285-stolengrass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408285"></a><figcaption>Light of Motiram's grass will likely look familiar to fans of the Horizon franchise.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408285-stolengrass.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At various points in both Light of Motiram's cinematic trailer and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9XNT8vTdeM">gameplay footage</a>, the player can be seen accompanied by a small, floating robot with a synthetic "eye" in the center of the device. The airborne gadgets look nearly identical to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny'</a>s Ghosts, and seem to have a somewhat similar function, scanning objects in the environment. (Unlike Ghosts, however, these little bots don't appear to revive downed players.)</p><p dir="ltr">As for gameplay, Light of Motiram's trailer mentions a dream about a benevolent deity doing not-so-benevolent things, and poses a question to the viewer: "Why can't human beings kill god?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408389-lom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408389-lom.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4408389"></a><figcaption>The game's art style is strikingly similar to that of the Horizon series.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4408389-lom.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This question doesn't seem to be addressed in combat, which takes a Monster Hunter-esque approach to hunting down and battling the aforementioned Mechanimals. These robotic animals can also evidently be tamed and aid players in combat. Additionally, <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#features" rel="nofollow ">the game's website</a> also mentions co-op and online play, though it's not immediately clear how multiplayer mechanics are integrated with the game's crafting and survival systems.</p><p>Tencent has yet to announce an official release date for Light of Motiram, but the game is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>. Light of Motiram will launch on mobile devices, PC, and PlayStation 5.</p>

It says, "In memory of PS2 last production. Produced 160,636, 885 pcs during January 2000 - March 2013." Some users were questioning its authenticity until former PlayStation president Shawn Layden chimed in. "PS2 pic looks legit.

                <p>It's been almost 10 years since The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt hit consoles. While the next installment in the series is still a ways away, CD Projekt can't wait to show fans what it has in store for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which has officially entered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">into full-scale production</a>.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, CD Projekt higher-ups--including CEO Michał Nowakowski and vice president of technology Charles Tremblay--confirmed that The Witcher 4 will be "bigger" and "better" than The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," said Trembley. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than The Witcher 3, it will be better than Cyberpunk--because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back."</p><p>Another thing the company doesn't want to go back to is how it markets the game. It wants to only begin the game's marketing campaign until it's truly ready, something it learned the hard way with Cyberpunk 2077. Nowakowski noted that they will still release teaser videos and other "crumbs" to stir reactions from fans to secure those preorders. However, it seems like the large-scale, big-budget trailers and assets will be reined in until the studio has a more solid release date in mind.</p><p>"I want to stress: it doesn’t mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]," said Nowakowski. "Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>No plot details of The Witcher 4 have been revealed, but at least CD Projekt management said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/">development on The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should be smoother</a> because the foundation will already be in place. CD Projekt management also mentioned how The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should take about three years each to develop, so fans can expect this newest Witcher trilogy to span into the 2030s.</p>

Drew, who divulges new information about the midseason update for Zombies. The developer reveals Citadelle des Morts contains a big focus on magic, and the map's unique Wonder Weapons will be four elemental swords. Drew describes the map as being large, but it does feature a lot of claustrophobic spaces within the castle.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, the Tesla Storm field upgrade and Vulture Aid perk returns from past Zombies modes. Players will also have a new ammo mod and 18 new augments to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Kevin Drew confirms some quality-of-life changes for the big Zombies update as well. This includes reduced Mangler spawns at mid-to-high rounds, as later rounds of Zombies are currently flooded with Manglers beyond round 25, making high-round attempts very frustrating for players. Treyarch is also including a cap on active Manglers up to Round 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the Vermin and Parasite rounds of Zombies take a long time to complete due to slow-spawning enemies, but Drew revealed the special rounds will become shorter after the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says more Zombies details will be revealed with the Season 1 Reloaded patch notes, which should arrive closer to the big update.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>.

                <p>Microsoft is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">new Halo games</a> right now, and actor Keith David is hopeful Microsoft calls him up to play the Arbiter once more. Across a series of social media posts, David said he's aware there "may be something new" in the works, but claims he knows nothing official.</p><p>"I don't know any more than all of you. I hear there may be something new and, if so, I'd love to reprise my role as the Arbiter. That's it. Nothing coded," <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862258022627852457" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said.</a></p><p>David voiced the Arbiter in 2004's Halo 2, reprising the role in 2007's Halo 3 and 2015's Halo 5: Guardians. He's also known in the world of video games for voicing David Anderson in the Mass Effect series and as the self-referencial Vice President Keith David in Saints Row IV. This year, David took over for the late Lance Reddick as the voice of Commander Zavala in Destiny 2.</p><p>Also on social media, David said he understands if people don't believe him, but he maintains that he <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1862305036321378387" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not know about any future Halo games and has not signed an NDA.</a> Instead, he's waiting to hear from Microsoft, and went on to say he'd love for one of the new Halo games to be an <a href="https://x.com/ImKeithDavid/status/1861942846338809878" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arbiter spin-off.</a></p><p>Outside of Halo and video games in general, David is known for voicing the Disney villain Dr. Facilier from The Princess and the Frog, along with his hundreds of appearances for film and TV in projects like Armageddon, The Thing, They Live, and Platoon, among numerous others.</p><p>In other Halo voice actor news, it recently came to light that Microsoft was apparently thinking about parting ways with Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes and Cortana actress Jen Taylor for Halo 4. However, Downes said Microsoft decided to hire him and Taylor again <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/master-chief-actor-says-halo-4-almost-recast-his-role-and-cortanas-with-new-voice-actors/1100-6528030/" data-ref-id="1100-6528030">after test audiences didn't like what they heard</a> from the actors hired to replace them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that 343 Industries had changed names to Halo Studios and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo games were in the works</a> and are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been announced, though. So far, Microsoft has only released footage from a demo called Project Foundry that aims to show off what is possible with Halo running on Epic's Unreal Engine.</p><p>The latest Halo game was 2021's Halo: Infinite, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-becomes-biggest-halo-launch-of-all-time/1100-6499962/" data-ref-id="1100-6499962">debuted to record-breaking numbers thanks to Game Pass but has since cooled off.</a></p><p>Microsoft's new Halo leadership is attempting to distance itself from Halo Infinite, saying the way that game was developed represented the "last remnant" of how Halo games were made.
