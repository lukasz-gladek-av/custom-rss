                <p>Five years into the PS5 lifecycle, Sony is confident that the best-selling game of all time for the system has yet to be released. In a new interview, PlayStation's senior VP of marketing, sales, and business operations, Eric Lempel, spoke about how the PS5 era has just started to find its feet, and he has an idea of what the console's biggest-selling game will be.</p><p>"I would say we're really hitting our stride now," Lempel said to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7e352emrro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC News</a>. As for the game that will be the PS5's sales juggernaut? "I'm not going to tell you which one, but I think it's still to come," Lempel added.</p><p>In the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-ps5-games/2900-7249/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is currently the best-selling PS5 game</a>, with Marvel's Spider-Man 2 in second place. Several more games are in development for the console, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/" data-ref-id="1100-6516081">Marvel's Wolverine</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/" data-ref-id="1100-6529491">Saros</a>. While those games are expected to sell well, it's the upcoming release of GTA 6 that analysts are predicting will be a blockbuster of note. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">Even with it being delayed to November 2026</a>, hype for GTA 6 still remains off the charts. Its predecessor, GTA 5, is the second-best-selling game of all time--220 million units shipped as of November 2025--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/">and it'll be coming back to the PS Plus Game Catalog</a> later this month.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-5-sales-draw-even-with-ps4-and-ghost-of-yotei-has-a-big-debut/1100-6536128/">Lifetime sales of the PS5 have reached 84.2 million consoles sold so far</a>, and Sony CFO Lin Tao suggested that the PS5 may have only reached the halfway point of its lifespan. Sony's recent investors report also confirmed that Ghost of Yotei has sold 3.3 million copies since launch, but the company has taken a $204 million hit due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-takes-a-204-million-hit-as-destiny-2-falls-short-of-expectations/1100-6536124/">Destiny 2 falling short of sales expectations</a>.</p>
