                <p>The developer behind the partially community-funded PC game Alzara: Radiant Echoes has announced it's shutting down and the game won't be released after the team raised more than $300,000 to make it.</p><p>Studio Camelia, which successfully raised €294,428 ($339,000 USD) from more than 5,000 people to fund the game via Kickstarter, made the announcement in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>"We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this," the studio said.</p><p>Studio Camelia will not refund money to people who contributed to the Kickstarter. "Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that," it said, adding that Kickstarter campaigns are inherently risky and are advertised as such.</p><p><a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005048173-Does-Kickstarter-issue-refunds#:~:text=Kickstarter%20is%20not%20a%20store,go%20along%20for%20the%20ride." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter says</a> people who pledge funds to a project should know beforehand that, "Kickstarter is not a store and we do not issue refunds. When you back a project, you're supporting a creator's right to try to make something new--and agreeing to go along for the ride."</p><h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2><p>The team wrote in a statement that it wanted to build a JRPG with a "fresh perspective," and one that was influenced by games like Final Fantasy X and Golden Sun. The company was funded in part by the Kickstarter campaign, along with money from staffers' own personal savings, along with "business angels, banks, and institutions." The game was also accepted into Microsoft's Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>However, all of this only covered half of what Studio Camelia said it needed to produce Alzara. So it decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to demonstrate to potential investors that Alzara had legs. The team then sought funding from an "industry partner," but it was ultimately unable to secure one.</p><p>"Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk," the statement said.</p><p>Studio Camelia attended Tokyo Game Show, DICE, and other industry events to meet with partners about raising funding, but "none of them resulted in a contract."</p><p>"We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could," the developer said. "This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn't be more true."</p><p>Alzara is now "on an indefinite pause" as the studio undergoes the liquidation process that requires "various legal procedures" that will run for "some time."</p><p>"There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!" the studio said.</p><h2><strong>Pre-production demo footage</strong></h2><p>While Alzara may never be released, Studio Camelia released pre-production demo footage of the game, showing it in its non-finished state. The studio said it cannot release the demo itself due to copyright reasons and issues pertaining to the liquidation process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLV5dIfrX4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLV5dIfrX4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Plenty of games enter development and are never released. The creative process, after all, is a fickle business. Blizzard, for example, says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about half of the games it begins development on.</a> Warner Bros., meanwhile, is reported to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">spent $100 million on a new Wonder Woman game before cancelling it. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is a great-looking game, leveraging the ray tracing enhancements that the latest iteration of iDTech affords the blood-soaked shooter. But if you're on PC, then you can unlock the true potential of the engine with the awaited path tracing update, at the expense of a lot of performance.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">path tracing</a> is an all-encompassing form of ray tracing, which simulates how rays of light bounce off surfaces, that is far more demanding. Objects shoot out more rays and allow those rays to bounce around a scene more than once, leading to far more accurate lighting, better ambient occlusion, and better reflections and surface material approximations. It is, when implemented correctly, a night-and-day difference to standard ray tracing techniques, albeit only afforded by some of the best hardware on the market.</p><p>Path tracing can be transformative in Doom: The Dark Ages, if you find the right scene to do some comparisons, and it's interior spaces seem to benefit the most. Light bounces and illuminates objects in ways that standard ray tracing can't afford, while the contrast between the areas where light is meant to be, and where it definitely shouldn't, are more naturally defined. Digital Foundry has released an extensive look at many of the improvements path tracing affords, which gives you a good idea if the additional visual flair is worth it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR3c9lyV5as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BR3c9lyV5as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's because you'll need to give up a lot of performance to take advantage of path tracing, even if you restrict which game objects make use of it. You'll be making heavy use of Nvidia's DLSS or frame generation to keep the action feeling smooth, with <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/i-tested-the-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-the-difference-is-night-and-day-but-my-gpu-got-hotter-than-hell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Guide</a> stating that performance plummeted by 40% on the RTX 5070Ti used for testing. Your mileage may vary depending on what GPU you're using, but just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> before it, this isn't a setting you can just turn on and forget about.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is another great entry in the modern reinvention of the series, continuing from the strong foundations established with 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, while taking the action in a wholly new direction. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, we praised this new direction saying, "Doom: The Dark Ages shows that there's still so much fertile ground that this series can explore, and that sometimes smart, measured changes can take the series in surprising new directions and yield some of its finest moments."</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros. Discover boss JB Perrette. In a statement, Perrette said the company is making these changes to "develop long-term franchise roadmaps" for Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC projects.</p><p>"We are very fortunate to have a strong stable of development and technology talent, and Yves, Shaun, and Steven are respected leaders with excellent track records in their areas of expertise. I'm looking forward to working closely with them and the team as we work to make the best games possible for our key franchises," Perrette said.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Variety</a>, this management shakeup did not lead to any layoffs or any executives leaving the company. Former WB Games top boss David Haddad left the company earlier this year, and it remains to be seen if the company is looking for a replacement.</p><p>Earlier this month, WB Discovery said it is breaking apart into two companies: WBD Streaming and Studios and WBD Global Networks. WB Games is part of the Streaming and Studios division, which is run by CEO David Zaslav.</p><p>In terms of upcoming releases, Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">Hogwarts Legacy sequel</a>.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> History Of Five Nights At Freddy's</p>
      </div>
<p>This current crossover includes a new playable character, Five Nights at Freddy's Springtrap. His character brings over elements from his franchise, including shocking animations, spring doors, and security cameras that impact gameplay. The crossover also includes a new map, Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza.</p><p>“It goes without saying that Five Nights at Freddy’s and Dead by Daylight feature diametrically opposed gameplay,” shared Jay Guzzo, Springtrap’s Killer Designer in a statement to GameSpot. “In the former, you’re mainly sitting in one room and managing a single resource--your battery. Whereas in DbD, it’s much more action oriented, and sitting still will likely get you nowhere fast. Our challenge became finding a way to get those two things to coalesce. It came down to identifying what creates that incredible tension in Five Nights and Freddy’s and adapting it into a dynamic format for our own game.”</p><p>Behavior Interactive has built out an expansive roster of 39 killers and 46 survivors for Dead by Daylight. This includes original characters and a huge variety of other recognizable faces like Nicolas Cage, Hellraiser, the Demogorgon, and many more. It's a dream team of horror icons.</p>

                <p>Do you enjoy fishing games but wish they had more horror elements? A new game, Out Fishing, blends together fishing and horror--and it certainly looks unique.</p><p>The first-person horror fishing game has players exploring a haunted forest to learn about a "forgotten disappearance near the lake." Then at nighttime, players have to prepare themselves for the "danger [that] lurks beneath the water."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvlX8LzExoc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nvlX8LzExoc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Out Fishing is developed by a single person at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/developer/munmungames?snr=1_5_9__2000" rel="nofollow ">Mūn Mūn Games</a> and the developer said it's inspired by Alan Wake, Silent Hill, and Mundaun.</p><p>"Explore a calm yet unsettling wilderness. Search for rare fish and scattered remnants of the past. Time is your enemy, but the farther you go, the closer you get to the truth. Fish, sell your catch, upgrade your gear, and build up your camp--a fragile safe zone where the line between memory and hallucination starts to blur," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>The entire goal of the game is to "reel in the one thing that was never meant to be found," but that's all the developer had to say.</p><p>Out Fishing is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660260/Out_Fishing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to wishlist now on Steam</a> but there is no word on a release date yet. If you enjoy fishing games, it's your lucky day, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hook-some-trout-in-steams-fishing-fest-sale/1100-6532465/" data-ref-id="1100-6532465">Steam is hosting a Fishing Fest sale now</a> with loads of fishing games on sale until June 23.</p>

However, unlike 8BitDo's original Ultimate Mobile Controller and similar models that use Bluetooth to connect to your phone, this uses USB-C 3.0, and features an additional USB port for connecting the Viture XR and Pro XR glasses for zero-lag gameplay. The $79 controller is available now at Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">While it currently only supports Android, Virtue says an iOS model will be available soon as well. A bundle that includes the Viture Pro XR Galsses and 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is also available for $468.</p><div title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532520 - Viture x 8BitDo ultimate controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Viture X 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$79</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller is an all-in-one mobile and XR gaming setup that utilizes USB 3.0 for a plug-and-play experience. As the name implies, it uses the excellent 8BitDo Ultimate--one of our favorite third-party controllers available on all consoles--as the basis for the design and features, including Hall Effect thumbsticks and triggers, two extra back buttons, and support for button remapping and other customization settings via the 8BitDo Ultiamte Software V2 app on mobile and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller's direct USB 3.0 connection is important because it eliminates the input lag present on some Bluetooth mobile controllers and prevents interference from other wireless signals.
