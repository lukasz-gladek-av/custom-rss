                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>

                <p>The last couple of years have seen several well-received Godzilla movies released, and parent company Toho is looking to grow that success beyond the silver screen. The Japanese studio has announced that it will invest $830 million in new games, anime, and other projects based on its IP, including Godzilla console games.</p><p>Toho plans to spend $490 million on content development alone, which will focus on a broad range of media as it pivots toward growing its brand overseas (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-14/-godzilla-studio-toho-to-invest-830-million-in-global-push" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>). In addition to an undefined number of Godzilla console games, the studio will also focus on animation, theme park attractions, and mobile games as part of its brand expansion strategy.</p><p>While Godzilla appeared in numerous video games over the decades, the last couple of years have seen the kaiju king relegated to crossovers and cameos. Games like Fall Guys have offered Godzilla cosmetics to players, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> featured Godzilla as an environmental hazard and enemy as part of its Operation Monarch event.</p><p>Recently, Godzilla has starred in several mobile games--and a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Into the Breach in 2022 called Godzilla: Voxel Wars--but the last big game featuring the titan was 2014's Godzilla for the PS4, which was later released in Europe and the US in 2015. That game was met with negative reception upon release, and it has an average critic score of 38 on GameSpot sister site <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/godzilla/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metacritic</a>.</p><p>"Godzilla commits so many game design sins that they become impossible to count, but the greatest horror of them all is that such giant monsters could be so boring," Kevin VanOrd wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/godzilla-review/1900-6416191/">Godzilla review</a>, scoring the game 3/10.</p><p>While it'll be a long time before Godzilla stomps his way back onto consoles, the cinematic future of the King of the Monsters looks bright. As mentioned above, a sequel to the Oscar-winning Godzilla Minus One is in development, and Legendary Pictures' Monsterverse will see the Godzilla and King Kong franchises team up for a third time in a movie that is scheduled to be released on March 26, 2027.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has been rolling out its RTX 50-Series graphics cards over the past few months, and today marks the arrival of the GeForce RTX 5060 Ti. <strong>Available in 8GB ($379) and 16GB ($429) formats</strong>, early reviews are calling it a solid addition to the Nvidia catalog and worth considering if you’re seeking a versatile mid-range card. Unsurprisingly, the new RTX 5060 Ti is a hot commodity, with retailers already selling out, though new stock is likely to return soon. To help track availability, we’ve put together a short list of major retailers most likely to have the RTX 5060 Ti in stock.

The end result is faster performance than its predecessor and the ability to upscale lower resolutions to 1440p and 4K resolutions. According to Nvidia, the RTX 5060 Ti offers double the performance of the old RTX 4060 Ti when DLSS 4 is enabled (it's worth noting that the RTX 5060 Ti's performance uplift over the 4060 Ti <em>without</em> DLSS 4 is closer to about 15% faster). You’ll find the GPUs to be much slimmer than the RTX 4060 lineup, too, thanks to AI technology that allows the hardware to hit better benchmarks without requiring the same raw horsepower.</p><p>A variety of 5060 Ti models (including overclocked variants) are available from third parties.

                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>
