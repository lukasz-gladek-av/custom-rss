                <p>Nintendo is bringing another beloved GameCube title to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service next week. The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luigis-mansion/" data-ref-id="5000-3596">Luigi's Mansion</a> is joining the classic games lineup on October 30.</p><p>Originally released alongside the GameCube in November 2001, Luigi's Mansion sees Mario's cowardly brother exploring a haunted mansion he won in a contest he never entered. With the help of Professor E. Gadd and his vacuum-like Poltergust 3000, Luigi must work his way through the mansion's many rooms and capture all the ghosts that lurk within.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvN4hHpfVqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvN4hHpfVqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Luigi's Mansion marks the sixth title to arrive on Switch Online's GameCube collection. The library launched alongside the Switch 2 with three games--The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur II--while Super Mario Strikers and Chibi-Robo were added to the lineup in July and August, respectively.</p><p>Nintendo will be bringing more GameCube games to the service in the future. The company has already confirmed that additional classics like Super Mario Sunshine, Pokemon Colosseum, and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance are on the way, although it hasn't yet announced when those games will be added.</p><p>The GameCube collection is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks available to Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Members can also download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free.</p><p>An individual subscription for the base Nintendo Switch Online service runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p>
