                <p>Sony San Diego has <a href="https://theshow.com/news/dude-perfect-cotw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that MLB The Show's Challenge of the Week has players trying to hit a 200MPH fastball. Those who earn the most points after the challenge concludes will be rewarded with prizes.</p><p>Sony San Diego has collaborated with the American sports and comedy group Dude Perfect for this week's Impossible Fastball Challenge of the Week. It'll run from April 4 at 12 PM PT / 3PM ET to April 11 at 11:59 AM PT / 2:59 AM ET. Players will need an internet connection and must be at least 18 years old to win the prizes:</p><ul><li>1st place: Paul Skenes autographed The Show ball</li><li>2nd place: Elly De La Cruz autographed The Show ball</li><li>3rd place: Gunner Henderson autographed The Show ball</li><li>4th – 10th place: 50,000 Stubs</li><li>11th – 20th place: 40,000 Stubs</li><li>21st – 40th place: 30,000 Stubs</li><li>41st – 100th place: 10 Challenge of the Week Exclusive Packs</li></ul><p>Players will play as Elly De La Cruz against a CPU-controlled Paul Skenes who throws a 200MPH fastball and rack up as many points as possible within three outs. GameSpot has attempted this challenge and it seems like players will literally need to swing the instant the pitch leaves Paul Skenes' hand in order to make contact with the ball.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 is now available on PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-25-review-still-the-mvp/1900-6418347/" data-ref-id="1900-6418347">MLB The Show 25 review</a>, we said, "MLB The Show 25 adds a number of impactful new features while tweaking its already excellent on-field action."</p>

                <p>TikTok's fate in the US will not be decided just yet. US President Donald Trump said today that he will sign an executive order that will keep the social media site running in the US for another 75 days. This is coming about amid reports of Amazon and Walmart reportedly gearing up to make bids to buy the company.</p><p>In January 2025, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-states-supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban/1100-6528877/" data-ref-id="1100-6528877">US Supreme Court upheld TikTok's ban</a>, and the platform briefly went dark. At the time, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find a US buyer until April 4, and now he's extended this again for another 75 days, ending June 18.</p><p>Today, Trump said he wants to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-china-bytedance-social-media-tariffs-665e46fd5bb555e97c4d7301e07230df?taid=67f01fc15dd9020001502013&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"save TikTok"</a> and that there has been "tremendous progress" thus far in the process of trying to find a buyer. However, he said a deal needs more time to come together, so he's signing a new executive order that will keep TikTok online in the US for at least another 75 days.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about national security over TikTok based on the company's ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. How a potential sale of TikTok might come together remains a mystery, whether it comes as a sale of TikTok's US operations, the platform entirely, or some other kind of deal beyond a total divestiture by ByteDance.</p><p>ByteDance is holding steady and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban-if-not-sold-by-chinese-trump-has-promised-a-solution" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying over and over that it will not sell.</a></p><h2><strong>Who Could Buy TikTok?</strong></h2><p>If TikTok were to be sold, who might buy the company? It was previously reported that Activision founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980?AID=11557093&amp;PID=5835937&amp;SID=01HW8CZB4VGN2YZN49J1WFXY5Q&amp;subid=digidip&amp;cjevent=c4115b2d025211ef810600720a82b824&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=digidip&amp;tier_4=3743973&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fwhy-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bobby Kotick was assembling an investment group to buy TikTok</a>. The AI company Perplexity has also <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tiktok-bytedance-trump-perplexity-87988733973760927bb5681f7de9b9af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discussed a potential deal</a> that would give the US government a 50% ownership stake in TikTok. Microsoft, meanwhile, is apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trump-says-microsoft-is-one-of-multiple-companies-eyeing-tiktok-purchase/1100-6529061/" data-ref-id="1100-6529061">interested in trying--again--to buy TikTok.</a></p><p>More recently, it emerged that Amazon and Walmart were entertaining making bids, or joining coalitions of companies in making bids, to buy TikTok. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/walmart-buying-tiktok-sources/story?id=120494441" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News reported</a> that Walmart was motivated to jump into the mix after Amazon, in part to obtain access to TikTok's massive userbase that Walmart could, in theory, sell products to.</p><p>Trump's messaging around TikTok is just the latest big story about how his policies are impacting entertainment products and services. His newly announced tariffs, for example, have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">led Nintendo to delay Switch 2 preorders</a>, sparking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">fears that the Switch 2 could end up being more expensive than anticipated.</a></p><p>For more, check out the story below.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">Will Tariffs Increase Switch 2's Price?

This problem seems to be secluded to the single-player campaign.</p><p>As for the new content, Bill and Marlene have been added as new playable characters. Four new maps are included as well: School, Nest, Streets, and Overlook. There are also new No Return Trophies for players to unlock, and a cosmetic skin for Ellie where she dawns on the jacket of Jordan A.

Previously, there was an issue where the Speedrun Mode timer would revert back to the most recent checkpoint if the player manually closed the game or if the game crashed. In No Return, there was a problem where Manny would lose 50 HP when he activated the Momentum ability.</p><p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is now available on PS5, as well as PC as of this week.
