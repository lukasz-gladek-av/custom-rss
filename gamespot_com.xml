                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to announce an ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, according to a new report. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's sources</a> said Microsoft is now testing an ad tier for the streaming service, with employees trying it out now before it may launch publicly for everyone.</p><p>The report said the free ad-based tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming will allow players to stream "some" of the games they already own, along with select titles from the "Free Play Days" promotion that allows people to play select titles on weekends at no cost. Xbox Retro Classics titles may be included, too.</p><p>In terms of the ads themselves, the report said the current iteration has people watching two minutes of preroll ads before jumping into a game. The report also mentioned that there could be streaming limitations, including a cutoff of one-hour sessions each and up to five hours for free each month. It's possible things change before the ad-based program goes live, if it does at all.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming version with ads is said to be in the works for PC, Xbox, handheld devices, and internet browsers. Prior to this report, an industry analyst said Microsoft might look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">offering people the ability to play games for free in exchange for watching ads.</a></p><p>An ad-based tier is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-for-free-microsoft-is-experimenting-with-ad-views-for-access-to-hundreds-of-xbox-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox boss Tim Stuart first hinted at it some time ago</a>. In August this year, Xbox boss Jason Ronald teased an evolution of Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on a podcast</a> that Microsoft was looking for a way to make the service "more affordable" and "accessible," and dropping the price to $0 is in line with that ambition.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">Xbox Cloud Gaming left beta and added more improvements.</a> Additionally, Microsoft announced that the highest-quality streaming, 1440p, will be locked behind the Game Pass Ultimate paywall, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">the price just went up to $30/month.</a></p><p>Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p>

                <p>So, you're bored at work, probably sitting in front of your computer scrolling nothing to look busy. (Did I just snitch on myself?) Maybe you'd rather be playing Sucker Punch Productions' new samurai fantasy sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, but you've got however many hours until you get home. Well, if you wanted to make the wait easier, you should definitely check out the recently released "Music from Watanabe Mode" soundtrack. It's a total vibe.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is the PlayStation 5-exclusive sequel to 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Many things in Yotei are similar to Tsushima, but there are a few differences. One of them is the newly introduced Watanabe Mode, a collaboration with Samurai Champloo director Shinichir≈ç Watanabe that features original lo-fi music created under his direction. You could only listen to these beats on your PS5 if you selected Watanabe Mode--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">one of three playable options</a> based on samurai film directors like Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike--but now, Sony has dropped the soundtrack on music streaming services.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EoEz8oFso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4_EoEz8oFso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released on October 3--one day after Yotei hit PS5--<a href="https://ghostofyotei.lnk.to/watanabe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "Ghost of Yotei - Music from Watanabe Mode - EP"</a> houses nearly 30 minutes of chill beats to kill (time) to. You can listen to it just about everywhere: Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube Music, and a streaming service I've never heard of called Deezer.</p><p>It's a real chill vibe. If you're familiar with Samurai Champloo and the artists Watanabe collaborated with for that legendary anime's soundtrack, then you know what to expect from this brisk but banging EP. It could fit right in with an episode of SamCham, and really brings that lowkey energy to Yotei's vengeful scenarios. It's a nice juxtaposition between the serious and the calm.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched on PlayStation 5 to generally favorable reviews from critics. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling awarded it a 9/10, saying it "builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist." Now that it's finally out, we've been busting ass on a bunch of guides to make your time in 1600 Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido, Japan) easier. This includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-weapons-locations-guide/2900-7098/" data-ref-id="2900-7098">where all the weapons are</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-best-skills/2900-7091/" data-ref-id="2900-7091">the best skills to unlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-wolf-den-locations/2900-7102/" data-ref-id="2900-7102">how to find all the wolf dens</a>, and more, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/which-ghost-of-yotei-mode-should-you-play/2300-6466416/" data-ref-id="2300-6466416">which mode you should play</a>. (You want my opinion? Play Watanabe Mode. It's perfect.)</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab is at it again with another frenetic physics-based cooperative game. After taking the gaming world by storm with Peak, which Aggro Crab co-developed with Landfall, the studio has given a first look at its next title, a four-player forklift co-op game called Crashout Crew. A demo for the game will be available during this month's Steam Next Fest.</p><p>The announcement trailer showcases four players attempting to fulfill warehouse orders, driving unusually fast forklifts that drift and boost, yielding predictably hilarious results as they spin out and bounce around.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">welcome to üí•CRASHOUT CREWüí¢<br>form a crew of up to 4 overworked friends and drift into a frantic co-op forklift experience where teamwork is key, disaster is inevitable and managing stress is all on you.<br>DEMO drops Oct 13th as part of Steam Next Fest‚ÄºÔ∏è<br>it's time to clock tf in. <a href="https://t.co/xZFL9ezwPT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xZFL9ezwPT</a></p>  ‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1973794973847072977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3583210/view/524229329545071235?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Community post</a>, Aggro Crab describes the warehouse as a "full-blown raceway" in which players aim to fulfill contracts that have unique and unusual boxes to ship. The trailer shows off a couple of examples, such as fragile eggs that will break if run over and crates filled with bees that will unleash a swarm if mishandled.</p><p>The Steam Next Fest demo, playable from October 13-20, will feature three of these contracts, which can be modified with "safety violations" to add layers of difficulty. Crashout Crew has a broad 2026 release window.</p><p>Aggro Crab began work on both Crashout Crew and Peak after canceling a sequel to the studio's dungeon-crawler roguelike Going Under. While some at Aggro Crab worked on Peak with Landfall, the rest of the studio "locked in" on Crashout Crew, which was conceptualized at a game jam.</p><p>So fret not, Peak fans, as Aggro Crab promises that Peak is still receiving updates. Last month, the climbing co-op game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peaks-latest-patch-brings-major-fixes-and-color-blindness-mode/1100-6534562/" data-ref-id="1100-6534562">received some major fixes</a>, most notably a colorblindness mode, and a recent update even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-players-are-passing-time-at-the-airport-in-increasingly-elaborate-ways/1100-6535123/" data-ref-id="1100-6535123">added activities to the airport lobby</a>.</p>

During the conversation, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hosted on Dring's The Game Business Show website and podcast</a>, the two discussed Battlefield 6's highly successful beta--which attracted an estimated 25 million players, surpassed 2.4 million Steam wishlists, and has 1.7 million Steam preorders. These figures, according to van Dreunen and London-based market researchers Ampere Analysis, suggest that Battlefield 6 could absolutely dominate at launch.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"However, Battlefield 6 clearly has huge momentum," Dring wrote. "Ampere believes the game will sell five million units in its first week, and the excitement for the game is growing as we near its October 10 launch. It's pretty much guaranteed a big day one, and if it can deliver a strong start, that will likely have a knock-on effect on Call of Duty (which arrives over a month later)."</p><p>For reference, <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2021/12/03/insider-battlefield-2042-reportedly-sells-over-4-million-copies-in-first-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reports suggest</a> that 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2024</a> sold 4.23 million units within its first week.</p><p>Call of Duty and Battlefield are fairly different beasts, with the former focusing mostly on smaller engagements and direct firefights while the latter is known for its enormous maps and blend of infantry and vehicular combat. However, they nevertheless fight for a similar audience, and we've often seen them matched up against each other during the fall gaming blitz. Perhaps the most notable was in 2011, which saw the release of Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3. </p><p>Battlefield 6 had a couple of betas in August, which were apparently so optimized that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/many-battlefield-6-fans-played-beta-using-minimum-specs-says-ea/1100-6534385/" data-ref-id="1100-6534385">according to EA</a>, many players jumped into the military-shooting action with minimum PC specs. And now that we're a week away from the game's full launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-pre-loading-on-xbox-is-live-now/1100-6535142/" data-ref-id="1100-6535142">you can pre-load the game on PlayStation and Xbox right now</a>. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">first season kicks off on October 28</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-achievements-trophies-revealed-see-all-50-here/1100-6535170/" data-ref-id="1100-6535170">the Achievements/Trophies have been revealed</a> if you're curious what it takes to get them.</p>
