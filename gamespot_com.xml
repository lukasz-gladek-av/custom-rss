          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000162828025047811/ea-20250930.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new regulatory filing</a>, Electronic Arts outlined a number of the risks the company faces, and one of them is the company's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion sale</a> to a private investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose risks to its business activity in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly 10-Q filings</a>. EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues. Already, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">a group of EA employees wrote a letter to jointly speak out against the proposed sale</a>, expressing a range of issues and concerns about it, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures. The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.

                <p>Rapper Soulja Boy is once again trying to sell a game console, this time selling what looks to be a rebranded Retroid Pocket Flip 2 under the name SouljaGame Flip.</p><p dir="ltr">In a post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/souljaboygame/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=aec8034c-b1b7-449b-ae69-bc2e82cd594a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> (spotted by <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Dodo</a>), the artist known for his 2007 hit song "Crank That (Soulja Boy)" can be seen showing off what appears to be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2. He said the device is actually a new SouljaGame Flip console that is "out right now" and can be bought from his website. He said it has "all the games you need," a "fast processor," and "good graphics."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulja Boy was originally selling "his" console for $436, over twice the $209 price the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 currently goes for on <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retroid's official website</a>. But since news began to circulate about the rebranded device and its hefty price tag, the price seems to have been slashed to $200, actually making it cheaper than buying the device directly from Retroid.</p><p dir="ltr">The website where the SouljaGame Flip can be ordered shows images that look to be taken straight from Retroid's own website, only with some additional images showing white packaging that say SouljaGame. Even the names of the different console colors on the Soulja Boy website are the same as that of the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, including the GameCube-inspired GC color scheme. The console's store page description states the SouljaGame Flip is "the ultimate handheld gaming console endorsed by Soulja Boy."</p><p dir="ltr">Retro Dodo reached out to Retroid about the whole affair, and received an official statement that made clear Soulja Boy selling repackaged Retroid Pocket Flip 2s is not any kind of official partnership.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is not any kind of official licensing deal," Retroid said. "He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the US by ourselves."</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if Retroid will pursue legal action, but it's not the first time Soulja Boy has tried to sell game consoles. In 2018, the rapper sold Chinese emulators under his own label, and again in 2021 with a rebranded Game Boy-inspired handheld called the TRDR Pocket.</p><p dir="ltr">The handheld gaming market is currently booming, with a growing retro emulation device market and the release of the Nintendo Switch 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/" data-ref-id="1100-6535471">Xbox-branded ROG Ally</a>.</p>

                <p>One of the recurring themes from a vocal segment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> fans before and after launch was a desire to see the game free of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enjoy-your-crossover-free-battlefield-6-now-because-its-naive-to-think-itll-stay-that-way/1100-6534361/" data-ref-id="1100-6534361">Call of Duty-style ridiculous skins</a>.

But after releasing the recent "Wicked Grin" skin, Battlefield Studios has quietly removed the light blue outfit from the lineup.</p><p>Much like an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-are-roasting-an-orange-skin/1100-6535592/" data-ref-id="1100-6535592">apparent orange skin</a> and an earlier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">leaked skin</a>, the response to the "Wicked Grin" outfit was largely swift and negative.</p><p>"[What do you mean?] That is classic naval camouflage, because of all that water. Just find a fountain and you are golden," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt4gwc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote one Reddit user</a>. "LMAO this is not grounded and horrible looking," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/comment/nkt5egr/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">added another fan</a>. "Doesn't even look cool. What a mess."</p><p>After the response from players, Battlefield Studios re-released this outfit in more conventional military uniform colors and left the light blue shades behind. Battlefield 6 recently received a number of new cosmetics <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-battle-pass-season-1-all-skins-weapons-and-other-rewards/2900-7179/" data-ref-id="2900-7179">in the Season 1 battle pass</a>.</p><p>EA recently announced a new mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-a-new-casual-mode-where-bots-outnumber-players/1100-6535868/" data-ref-id="1100-6535868">Casual Breakthrough</a>, which will let Battlefield 6 players earn Career XP, Weapon XP and Battle Pass XP, while also accruing points towards challenges.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>

<p>"What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have," Watkins said. "It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction."</p><p>That's not to say "novelty" skins like Ronald McDonald or something like that will never appear in Arc Raiders. Instead, if Embark Studios were to consider these out-of-place costumes, Watkins said the team would likely create a skin that alludes to a person rather than being that person. Think more color scheme and less actual appearance. So, no <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">Nicki Minajs</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-adds-snoop-dogg-as-a-playable-character/1100-6502133/" data-ref-id="1100-6502133">Snoop Doggs</a> here.</p><p>"I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus," Watkins said. "That's not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that's kind of the line you can draw. We're pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don't know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly--I don't think the novelty is worth the trade."</p><p>It would be hilarious to see Santa Claus or a T-Rex-- or even Sabrina Carpenter--tearing robots apart with a pulse rifle, but that doesn't fit the game's design language. Maybe this could happen in the future, but for now, there are no such "novelty" skins coming.</p><p>"Novelty" and silly skins have been a hot-button topic in shooters lately, particularly among the likes of Battlefield and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">admitted that the series may have strayed from its grittier identity</a>, confirming that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> won't let you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">transfer your wacky costumes</a> from Black Ops 6.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> may soon receive a new form of premium currency called Hearthsteel, one that will likely be used to buy housing-specific items.</p><p dir="ltr">A datamine by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/hearthsteel-new-premium-currency-coming-in-midnight-379087" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a> of the alpha build for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion revealed the currency and a number of icons that show increasingly larger amounts of it, reminiscent of the icons used to denote premium currency bundles. The currencies are linked to a description that states they are part of a housing market bundle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/22Nf00VN0WM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard has not yet released official details about how Hearthsteel will work or what it will be used for, it's likely it will be similar to that of Trader's Tender, another premium currency used for the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-trading-post-introduces-a-new-way-for-players-to-buy-items/1100-6511091/" data-ref-id="1100-6511091">Trading Post vendor</a>. Trader's Tender is primarily earned in-game by completing monthly challenges. The currency can't be bought on its own in the in-game shop but is included as part of other shop cosmetic bundles. It's also given out as a reward for preordering various editions of WoW's next expansion as well, with more expensive versions of the expansion granting more of the currency.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearthsteel might be used similarly in that it's something players may be able to earn by playing but also acquire by buying certain cosmetics on the store. Blizzard has already confirmed it will be selling housing related cosmetics via the shop, so Hearthsteel could potentially be included as part of those bundles for use at a specific housing-item vendor, similar to the Trading Post.</p><p dir="ltr">Until Blizzard officially outlines its plans, players will be left to speculate wildly about another form of microtransaction coming to the MMORPG, something one would think Blizzard would like to explain and justify sooner rather than later.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming Hearthsteel will be coming alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">housing early access as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch</a>, players might not have wait long to learn more. The patch is expected to arrive in December. Midnight does not yet have an official release date but is expected to arrive in February 2026 based on a datamine revealing a date for the expansion's pre-patch.</p><p dir="ltr">Midnight's pre-patch will add the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-datamine-reveals-when-player-housing-will-likely-arrive-in-full/1100-6535796/" data-ref-id="1100-6535796">entirity of WoW's housing system</a> by introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">Neighborhood events</a>.

                <p>Remember the good old days when Flash games were at their peak, and it seemed like we had an unlimited free gaming library to choose from, no matter the type of PC you had? While that gilded era is now behind us, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FXHVX3VS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a> will soon let us revisit some of the most memorable Neopets browser games when it launches for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC on March 26, 2026. The game will feature 25 classic Neopets flash games, plus an all-new minigame exclusive to this collection made by the original Neopets team, and a secret unlockable bonus minigame, for a total of 27 minigames. Each classic minigame has been enhanced for modern platforms with higher-resolution graphics and new features like local co-op modes. Preorders are available now for just $30, and securing an early copy gets you some cool physical extras and bonus DLC.</p><h2>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p>The physical PS5 or Nintendo Switch versions of Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection come with an exclusive set of extra items, including a double-sided poster, two sticker sheets, three art cards, and DLC for the Neopets website. While not strictly preorder bonuses, preordering your copy is a wise decision if you want these extras, as they may sell out soon after launch. Note that these bonus items are only included in the physical edition of the game. There are no preorder bonuses included in the digital edition.</p><div title="6535854 - Neopets Mega Mini Games Collection" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4860" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535854 - Neopets Mega Mini Games Collection" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FXHVX3VS,B0FXHX2XJ7&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$30 | Releases March 26, 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection includes the base game on your platform of choice, plus the extra items listed above if you grab the physical edition.

Local co-op play is enabled for select games in the collection, including Snowball Fight, Jumpin’ Gem Heist, Jubble Bubble, and more, which means you can bring a friend along for part of your journey. The game also syncs with Neopass so you can unlock cosmetics, currency, and other rewards for the official Neopets website.</p><p>Physical PS5 and Nintendo Switch editions are available for preorder at Amazon. Digital preorders are also available.</p></div>                      </div><p>While Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection isn't getting a dedicated Switch 2 release, it will be playable on Nintendo's new console thanks to backward compatibility.
