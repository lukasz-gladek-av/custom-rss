                <p dir="ltr">Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-tmnt-crossover-could-be-coming/1100-6529089/">recent leaks</a>, Activision has officially confirmed Call of Duty's next big IP collaboration is with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Season 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is themed around ninjas, so there's no better time to bring in the heroes in a half-shell.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision made the TMNT crossover announcement with a <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1890098739915768252" rel="nofollow ">brief teaser clip</a> for Call of Duty, which shows Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo peeking out from a sewer manhole. This likely means there will be operator skins for all four turtles. Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab for 2022's Modern Warfare 2</a>, but the only character featured was Shredder.</p><p dir="ltr">The video doesn't give a specific date for the TMNT collaboration, teasing only that the turtles will be "coming soon." However, the Season 2 Reloaded update is set to include a set of melee weapons, which is rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard. Leonardo's katanas were previously teased in the promotional art for the launch of Season 2. This means the turtles will likely appear with the midseason "Reloaded" update or sometime shortly after.</p><p dir="ltr">Leakers suggested the crossover will include a limited-time event and a special TMNT-themed game mode, but those details haven't been confirmed by Activision. The turtles themselves will likely be included as operator shop bundles.</p><p dir="ltr">A Terminator crossover event is also currently live in Black Ops 6 and Warzone until February 20. For more on the upcoming midseason update, make sure to check out everything announced for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6529404/">Black Ops 6 and Warzone in Season 2 Reloaded</a>.</p>

In Dawnshore, you can purchase a treasure map from Sanza's Emporium for 100 Gold, <strong>Wodeica's Inheritance</strong>, which leads to the Gloves of the Strangler, a unique set of gloves. Sanza' Emporium is a ship found in Northern Paradis, which is considered a separate region from the main part of the city and is accessed via the main quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Where to find Woedica's Inheritance</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441402"></a><figcaption>Woedica's Inheritance can be found outside the eastern wall of Paradis.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4441402-woedica7.jpeg"></figure><p>To find Woedica's Inheritance, you should start at the Eastern Paradis Gate Beacon fast travel point.
