                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> fans have a lot of themed merchandise to choose from, but anyone looking for something that thematically fits the game and offers some utilitarian use will want to check out this next collaboration: an actual--and functional--exoskeleton that'll put some pep in your step.</p><p>As part of its partnership with Kojima Productions, manufacturer <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dnsys has revealed the Death Stranding 2 Z1 Exoskeleton</a>, a limited-edition co-designed by the studio's art director, Yoji Shinkawa. There's no pricing yet for the exoskeleton ahead of its December 2 release, but considering that a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dnsys/dnsys-z1-knee-exoskeleton-defy-gravity-go-beyond?ref=5r8xb1" rel="nofollow ">basic Z1 model for both legs costs $1,500</a>--and can go up to $2,800 for the model that includes hip support and other extras--that should give you an idea of what to expect here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4599552-death-stranding-exoskeleton.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599552" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4599552-death-stranding-exoskeleton.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599552"></a><figcaption>This should make carrying groceries easier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4599552-death-stranding-exoskeleton.jpg"></figure><p>Dnsys says that the Death Stranding 2 Z1 exoskeleton features visual and design elements inspired by the game, including lights that allow you to check the battery level and functionality of the robo-legs. The company added that you'll get up to four hours of continuous use with quick-swap batteries, knee pressure relief, 50% extra power to your steps, a hiking range of up to 15.5 miles, and it'll make you feel "44lbs" lighter.</p><p>In Death Stranding, exoskeletons are some of the key gear that players can equip to help them deliver packages across the post-apocalyptic world. Ranging from standard models to combat-oriented gear that makes machine-powered dropkicks especially devastating, they're worn by almost every courier in the game, including Sam Porter Bridges. Outside of exoskeletons, Kojima Productions also offers branded clothing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-death-stranding-2-fanciest-in-game-timepiece-is-real-but-itll-cost-you-1600/1100-6530011/">expensive Death Stranding 2 watches</a>, collectible figures, and even an <a href="https://kojimaproductions-store.com/products/death-stranding-cryptobiotes-key-chain" rel="nofollow ">adorable cryptobiote keychain</a>--just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-players-can-now-chow-down-on-irl-cryptobiotes/1100-6533940/">don't let Fragile see it</a>.</p><p>For something more affordable, you can check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-new-death-stranding-2-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-from-the-games-world/1100-6535766/">Death Stranding Backbone One controller</a> for smartphones or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hot-toys-reveals-death-stranding-2-higgs-figure-that-looks-impressively-realistic/2900-7200/">Higgs figure from Hot Toys</a> that has wool-implanted hair.</p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">crossover event with The Simpsons</a>--which includes multiple Simpsons-themed skins and a new map inspired by Springfield--is one of the game's most successful events ever, with over three million concurrent players logging in over the weekend. A new short, uploaded today on the official Fortnite YouTube channel, shows how Epic Games will up the ante in tomorrow's update--if you plan to log in, keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awAmdYB6Xuc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the skis...er, skies</a>.</p><p>The short features Homer and Professor Frink speaking about the shard Homer has installed into his TV remote. Frink wants to analyze it, but Homer isn't through using it, as he immediately transforms a nearby round cloud into a massive donut, which falls from the sky. Homer then transforms Frink into a new version of Peely dressed as the professor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYY9ghy8EQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GaYY9ghy8EQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video then shifts to gameplay footage, which showcases massive donuts falling from the sky all over the Springfield map. We also get new glimpses of some upcoming skins: Lisa Simpson, who is riding in a mech like her brother Bart; Moe Szyslak, the grumpy bartender; and Peely dressed as Professor Frink from the animated short, which seems to be the second skin available in the Springfielder Peely portion of the current battle pass.</p><p>Finally, the trailer shifts back to another animated scene, with the aftermath of Homer's antics in full view. The town is complaining to Mayor Quimby about the food raining from the sky, and the town agrees to put a stop to it. Meanwhile, Homer disposes of the shard by throwing it into nuclear waste, then falls into the waste himself--only for multiple Homers to appear, seemingly teasing the next major change coming to the Fortnite Simpsons event.</p><p>Fortnite is free to download and play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices. The current Simpsons-themed season is scheduled to run until November 29.</p>
