                <p>A veteran high-ranking game developer has sounded off on the use of artificial intelligence systems in gaming, saying developers who fail to adopt the technology run the risk of selling themselves short. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN</a>, former Sony Santa Monica director of product development Meghan Morgan Juinio said AI is a "tool" and "something that will augment" human creators, not replace them.</p><p>"At least for right now, that's how I see it. It's going to evolve whether you're on board with it or not, so I want to be at the forefront of helping to guide how that goes and how we use it," Juinio said.</p><p>She added: "I think if we don't embrace it, I think we're selling ourselves short."</p><p>Juinio went on to say that developers in the video game industry have been using forms of generative AI for decades already, singling out the SpeedTree tool that was used all the way back in 2006 to help populate the foliage in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Developers have used procedurally generated and handcrafted assets in development processes for a long time already and generative AI could be the next evolution of that, she said.</p><p>Just because a developer can use generative AI doesn't necessarily mean they should, however, Juinio said.</p><p>"I think as leaders in the video game industry it is on us to figure out not just <em>can </em>we do it with AI, but <em>should </em>we? And it's a case-by-case type of decision making process and what's true for game X might not be true next year for game Y," she explained.</p><p>Finally, Juinio said games today absolutely need human developers to form the ideas of a given project, mentioning that God of War's story is a "human story that is based on human experiences."</p><p>Juinio is not the only prominent game developer to believe that adopting AI can help the video game industry. Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p>

                <p>With the PS5 turning five years old in November, discussion about its successor has begun to intensify. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">Sony and AMD recently spoke about new technological breakthroughs</a> that it was pioneering, and former SIE Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">rumored PS6</a> and how Sony needs to do more than just chase graphics for its next-generation console.</p><p>Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/bs7KLs8krho?t=4033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Yoshida explained how the graphical capabilities of current-gen hardware were starting to hit a wall and that the company needs to start thinking beyond pure graphical power to attract a wide audience. "PlayStation--in my mind--they can't do the same thing they have been doing, increasing the graphics power and providing the high-end experiences," Yoshida said. "They might just do that, but still, that feels like a niche audience right now."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs7KLs8krho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bs7KLs8krho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Yoshida doesn't know what he'd do to make the PS6 stand out if he were still at PlayStation, he did stress that he was confident that the current leadership of the company--led by CEO Hideaki Nishino--is capable of bringing something "disruptive" to the industry, thanks to them being relatively young in comparison to the previous management generation.</p><p>What the proposed PS6 will eventually look like remains to be seen, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">but it has been reported that Sony is considering</a> a detachable disc drive option for it, similar to the one that can be attached to the current PS5 Pro Digital Edition and PS5 Pro consoles. One area where Sony is also looking to keep things old school is the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software for it installed on the SSD. Sony says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a> in this area of console design.</p><p>Sony's rival, Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">is banking on a powerful next-generation Xbox</a> to win fans over, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">Xbox President Sarah Bond teased</a> a "high-end curated experience" for users.</p>

                <p>PS5 console owners can grab a fresh firmware update for the console--Version: 25.07-12.20.00--and alongside the usual stability upgrades, there are also a few other tweaks being made to the hardware. Anyone who wants to check the serial number of their console and DualSense controller can now do so, as Sony says the update adds this option.</p><p>Beyond that, stability improvements have also been made to the DualSense Edge wireless controller, messages and usability on some screens have been enhanced, and system performance has also been brushed up.
