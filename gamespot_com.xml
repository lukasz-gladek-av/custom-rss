Players who have preordered the game's Midnight expansion and log in after the release of the MMORPG's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">11.2.7 patch</a> will automatically receive a quest that will lead them straight into the housing tutorial. If players somehow lose the tutorial quest, they can easily start it again by clicking on the new housing icon in the game's micro menu.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft - Housing 101 Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The tutorial will show players around the neighborhood, the basics of decorating, and answer some common housing-related questions players may have. As noted in the video, housing is available almost immediately, even for entirely new players. After doing the first few quests in the tutorial zone Exile's Reach, new players will be given the option of continuing with the game's introductory zone or jumping straight into the housing tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will be able to easily see which houses are available for purchase in any given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">neighborhood</a>. There's plenty of housing plot options for all kinds of players, with a variety of different biomes to choose from. Those who want to be more secluded can buy a home farther away from the center of town, while others may want to be closer to the action and have neighbors directly next door.</p><p dir="ltr">If a specific plot is taken, players can simply travel to a different neighborhood until they find one where it's available. A house typically costs 1,000 gold but that already-small fee is waived for brand-new players. Players aren't locked into a specific neighborhood or plot, and can pick up their house (as well as all of its interior and exterior decorations) and move to a new plot or neighborhood at any time for a fee.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorating, Blizzard is giving players plenty of options</a>. All players will receive a housing starter pack of decor items to get going. Both the inside of a home and the outside plot can be customized with decor items gained from quests, raids, professions, vendors, and more. There are both simple and advanced tools for placing and customizing decor items for those who want to get lost in the details. As players increase their housing level over time, they'll be able to add more rooms to their home and place even more decor.</p><p dir="ltr">For those worried about what happens to their home if they take a break from WoW and let their subscription lapse, the home is never lost. It will be saved as it last was with all of its decorations and customizations and put into storage after a certain amount of time, freeing up whatever neighborhood plot it occupied. Once that player resubscribes to WoW, the home can then be placed back down in a new plot or neighborhood.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out Blizzard's Housing 101 video above for a more in-depth look, but housing in WoW looks to be remakarbely straightforward compared to how it can be in some other MMOs, where players need to enter a house lottery or pay taxes on their virtual real estate. Housing will be available early for those who preorder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight, with the expansion proper coming on March 2, 2026</a>. Completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-gets-you-rewards-in-other-blizzard-games-including-an-overwatch-2-skin/1100-6536542/" data-ref-id="1100-6536542">WoW housing tutorial will score players some additional rewards</a> in other Blizzard games, including an Overwatch 2 skin.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder and ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has given more opinions on artificial intelligence, claiming that we're not too far off from a future in which the controversial technology eats itself in some sort of ouroboros way that gives us mad cow (AI?) disease.</p><p>Speaking to Chris Evans (not the actor) for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4RTTcvFxJU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his Virgin Radio UK Breakfast Show on November 26</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/rockstar-co-founder-compares-ai-to-mad-cow-disease-and-says-the-execs-pushing-it-arent-fully-rounded-humans/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Houser was asked about his gaming origins, the founding of Rockstar Games and the creation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto/" data-ref-id="5000-1060">Grand Theft Auto</a>, and his new sci-fi thriller novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise</a>. During the nearly 30-minute chat, Evans questioned Houser about the technodystopia he laid out in A Better Paradise and whether AI is as amazing as C-suite executives want us to think it is. Houser isn't fully convinced.</p>

<p>"I personally don't think it will because AI is going to eventually eat itself," Houser said. "As far as I understand it--which is really a superficial understanding--the models scour the internet for information, but the internet is going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So, it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information will get better if they're running out of data. [AI] will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly, and it's going to become this sort of mirror of itself."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Houser is possibly hinting at the "dead internet" theory, or the idea that the internet is largely made up of bots and AI-generated content engaging with and scraping itself. A <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/-the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">May 2024 paper by the University of New South Wales</a> purports that the implications of this theory--and the evidence we're seeing with the proliferation of tools like chatbots and LLMs--suggest a more sinister undertone of politicking and profiteering.</p><p>Houser admitted that AI can "get you some information very quickly" if you ask it to perform specific tasks, but he noted that it's still "random and wrong a lot of the time." He also clarified that, particularly as an underscore to his novel, the "human element" can never be replaced by AI, no matter how hard billionaires want it to.</p><p>"Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people," Houser said. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. That's one of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans."</p><p>Houser's latest AI criticism follows his previous comments about the controversial technology. While touring his novel, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">AI is overrated</a> and claimed the games industry is at a tough crossroads.</p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," Houser said on a November 23 episode of Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>Dan Houser is no longer with Rockstar Games, but development continues at the studio on Grand Theft Auto 6. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently suffered a delay</a> to November 19, 2026, and has found itself at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">the center of controversy over the firing of staffers</a>.</p>
