                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that a new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> will be shown off at The Game Awards this week. On Twitter/X, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford teased</a> that the next look at the upcoming game will contain a mix of gameplay and a "never-before-seen original cinematic sequence" set halfway between the end of Borderlands 3 and the beginning of Borderlands 4.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Yes, there is GAME PLAY in the trailer! Also, in addition to a lot of in-game footage, I will share a sick, never-before-seen original cinematic sequence depicting a moment that occurs about half way between the end of Borderlands 3 and the beginning of Borderlands 4. I AM… <a href="https://t.co/yV7r7WUlRt" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/yV7r7WUlRt</a></p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1866166033465106733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Although Pitchford has regularly teased the game, little is known about Borderlands 4 so far. While there has been a trickle of information--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">like one of the new planets</a> being shown off in concept art--details on the playable Vault Hunters, the next big villain, or if Claptrap will ever get people to attend his pizza party have been kept locked up tighter than an Eridian vault.</p><p>One snippet of information that Pitchford did confirm was that the antagonist for the game won't be Handsome Jack, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">as something "far more dangerous"</a> than the legendary Hyperion CEO will be threatening players. While this will be a first look at the game for many fans this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terminally-ill-fan-was-able-to-play-borderlands-4-early-and-he-says-its-amazing/1100-6528091/" data-ref-id="1100-6528091">a terminally ill Borderlands fan</a> named Caleb McAlpine managed to get a sneak peek at the game after Gearbox heard of his request to see it.</p><p>Borderlands 4 was officially revealed during the opening night of Gamescom in August, and the game is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025. Publisher Take-Two Interactive plans to have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">comfortable gap between Borderlands 4 and Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, as it wants to avoid cannibalizing potential sales.</p>

                <p>Surprise! CD Projekt Red still has more updates planned for Cyberpunk 2077, months after the Polish studio said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no longer had anyone working on the game</a>. The studio has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which will introduce "new features" to the role-playing game.</p><p>CD Projekt Red isn't ready to disclose what these features are but said it will host a video broadcast on December 10 where it will "dive deep" on what's coming to the game. The broadcast takes place at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET / 5 PM CET on December 10, and it will be streamed live on Twitch and YouTube.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 REDstreams alert 📢<br>Join us for a new episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REDstreams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#REDstreams</a>, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2!<br>See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel.… <a href="https://t.co/gxABDNpQN2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gxABDNpQN2</a></p>  — Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At the end of May 2024, CD Projekt Red confirmed that, for the first time in 10 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no one at the studio was working on Cyberpunk 2077.</a> Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion came out in September 2023, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-big-cyberpunk-2077-update-launches-december-5/1100-6519672/" data-ref-id="1100-6519672">final major update landing in December 2023. </a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 originally launched in December 2020.

                <p>Considering that it's taken over a decade for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to reach players, expectations are sky high for Rockstar Games' next GTA installment. That anticipation and the hype behind it are being parodied on PlayStation Store with a page for Grand Taking Ages 6, a game that may or may not actually exist.</p><p>The listing for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages 6</a> appears to have gone online around December 7, and it features what appears to be AI-generated art in the vein of GTA 6 along with a synopsis that suggests it will put players in charge of their own game studio simulation. According to the description, it allows fans to "run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses." It also claims the game will be released in May 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg"></figure><p>The page includes fake review quotes from GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer "from [a] parallel universe where the game is already out." It also features a dedication to the players who didn't live long enough to see Grand Taking Ages 6's release, before adding that "PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will."</p><p>While a game developer tycoon game like this could be an intriguing indie title, this parody doesn't seem to have a real game behind it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-vi-pops-up-on-the-playstation-store-once-again-reminding-us-that-curation-basically-doesnt-exist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> notes that the developer listed, Violarte sp. z o. O., only recently launched an official site with "fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI." In other words, this appears to be a joke, but it does call into question how it was able to pass review before it was listed on PSN. </p><p>The first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">recently had its one-year anniversary</a> without a follow-up trailer. A developer from Rockstar also promised "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-teases-mind-blowing-things/1100-6527967/" data-ref-id="1100-6527967">absolutely mind-blowing things</a>" in the sequel while accepting GTA 6's Most Anticipated Game award at the Golden Joysticks. Nearly a month ago, Rockstar confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">remains on track for a Fall 2025 release</a> onPlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
