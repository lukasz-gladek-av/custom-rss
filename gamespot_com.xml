                <p dir="ltr">Long before the Switch changed everything, I found myself more drawn to handheld gaming than the home console. I remember feeling more passionate about my Game Boy Advance library than the PlayStation 2. So it didn't come as much surprise to me when the Switch, and then the Steam Deck, captured so much of my attention and gaming time. The Steam Deck has since become my primary gaming device, due to its level of adaptability and wealth of cheap games on Steam. But even as a devoted Steam Deck acolyte, the ROG Xbox Ally X made an impression on me. There's a lot to be seen about the quasi-Xbox handheld, but it may even make a convert out of me.</p><p dir="ltr">I was able to try the ROG Xbox Ally X briefly at the Xbox showcase adjacent to Summer Game Fest. The presentation was mostly hands-off, with a brief period in which we were allowed to play Gears of War: Reloaded on it. So my impressions are a mixture of practical experience and big promises, but so far I like what I've both seen and heard.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For starters, the actual ergonomics of the device feel very nice by default. I've equipped both my Steam Deck and my Switch 1 with third-party grips, increasing their bulk in exchange for a better feeling of holding it. The ROG Xbox Ally X cuts out the middleman and just includes the more substantial handles from the start, making it a little larger and weightier than competing devices, but no more than I've already been doing for myself with add-ons. As someone who primarily plays handheld systems at home or while traveling, I usually have a place to rest my arms while I play, so the increased weight won't be a problem.</p><p dir="ltr">The controller layout is meant to emulate the familiar Xbox controller, and to that end, it looks to succeed reasonably well. The Xbox button is no longer centered--obviously, since there's a screen in the middle--but its new placement within a ROG trapezoid shape makes enough sense. Everything else, from the sticks to the face buttons to the triggers, felt to my hands just like you were holding onto an Xbox controller, albeit one that had been stretched out in the middle to accommodate a screen.</p><p dir="ltr">The user interface, too, looks very similar to the current Xbox UI. That means the same large square icons to represent games in your library, with a sequence of panels to reach different areas of the interface. Impressively, though, Microsoft is promising that it will bring together all of your third-party libraries in one place. That means your Xbox and Game Pass library, naturally, but also storefronts like Epic and Steam. (The presentation didn't call Steam by name, but a Steam logo was prominently displayed in its slide about third-party storefronts).</p><p dir="ltr">I've gotten Xbox streaming and storefronts like Epic running on my Steam Deck, but it took a bit of setup, and I still forget which games I already own in Epic because I have to launch into its own storefront to see that library. Having all of my owned games across a variety of platforms is the kind of quality-of-life feature that makes the ROG Xbox Ally X feel more like what you would expect from the console experience: It just works the way you think it should work.</p><p dir="ltr">Likewise, elements like system performance are foregrounded in a way that feels more approachable for gamers who may not want to delve deep into system menus. Tapping or holding the Xbox button brings up different contextual menus showing things like power, RAM usage, and more. This is similar to the "..." button on the Steam Deck, but being tied to the main Xbox button makes it feel less like an afterthought.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Xbox representatives handed the ROG Xbox Ally X systems for us to demo, they were being treated very delicately, and our time was fairly short. It does feel like this is a piece of in-development tech and we were warned there could be hiccups. I didn't experience any, but the warning itself goes to show that the product isn't finalized. And later in the day when I went to play an extended Gears of War: Reloaded demo, the ROG option was just there alongside the Xbox and PS5 versions, so that gave me a bit more time with it.</p><p dir="ltr">Gears of War: Reloaded is, at its heart, still a game from the Xbox 360 era, but it's gotten a series of visual improvements that really stand out when shown side by side to the original. Everything is cleaner, and while the world is still grim, both Ultimate Edition and Reloaded have made it less muddy and brown. So it's hard to know how this should be judged as a benchmark compared to more modern performance-pressing games like Cyberpunk 2077. But the game looked and ran beautifully, and on top of that, the fan was nice and quiet.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of unknown elements to the ROG Xbox Ally X, not least of all being its price tag. The 2024 Rog Ally X, sans Xbox elements, starts at a whopping $900, so we can probably expect the ROG Xbox Ally X to demand a similar price tag, if not more. Still, my brief hands-on did something that I haven't experienced since falling in love with my Steam Deck in 2022. It made me feel jealous.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 2042 was released back in 2021, but it's still getting new DLC, and the newest batch of add-on content is a crossover with another popular EA franchise: Mass Effect.</p><p>The Galactic and the Scoped &amp; Dropped bundles are now available to purchase in Battlefield 2042. They include new cosmetics that make your character look like a soldier from the Mass Effect series. These items came to Battlefield 2042 as part of the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-8-9-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8.9.0 update</a> that arrived today, June 17.</p><p>The Galactic bundle costs 1750 BFC and the Scoped &amp; Dropped bundle is priced at 2,000 BFC. Alternatively, players can buy them together in the Citadel bundle for 3,000 BFC, which represents a savings compared to buying them individually. BFC can be purchased with real money or earned by progressing through Battlefield 2042's battle pass.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 is also rolling out a mode called "Conquest Ascension," which is inspired by Mass Effect. "<span>Rise above the rest and train for a new century of warfare. Use Ascension tactics with added crawl and squad spectating mechanics to assure the future for humanity that any commander would be proud of," reads a line from its description.</span></p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-crosses-over-with-dead-space-bringing-necromorphs-to-the-military-fps/1100-6524681/" data-ref-id="1100-6524681">Battlefield 2042 had a crossover with EA's Dead Space franchise in 2024.</a></p><p>While there are still people playing Battlefield 2042, many are eagerly awaiting the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, or whatever the next entry in the series is called. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">EA will officially reveal the game this summer</a>, but it remains to be seen exactly when that might happen.</p><p>As for the Mass Effect franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">BioWare is now working on the next game</a>, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-show-brings-on-one-of-its-most-important-creative-roles-report/1100-6532187/" data-ref-id="1100-6532187">Mass Effect TV series is also in the works. </a></p>

                <p>One of the Switch 2's features is a much-improved kickstand, providing a more sturdy and durable way of propping the screen up in comparison with the original Switch. Some Switch 2 owners have realized that this kickstand can essentially be used as a mounting arm, leading to the creation of ways to attach the consoles to increasingly ridiculous places.</p><p>Some of these mounting methods are genuinely cool and useful, such as clamping the kickstand in between a tray table and a seatback in an airplane seat, as shown by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l9rqno/new_use_for_the_switch_2_kickstand_on_a_plane/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/NintendoSwitch2 user Lokeze</a>. While many people will have no problems using the Switch 2 on a tray table, having the screen higher up and further away might be slightly more comfortable.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>As <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/player-finds-new-way-to-use-the-nintendo-switch-2-on-a-steering-wheel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> reported, though, there are also some people coming up with downright dangerous places to mount the console. One player figured out how to attach it to a car steering wheel--leading to a "setup" that, if driving, is almost certainly illegal throughout the United States and is definitely not something to try. I can imagine that it might be useful if you find yourself sitting in the driver's seat while parked for a long period of time, such as waiting in an airport cell phone lot... But be 100% certain that the car is not moving if you decide to check this out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4515996-new-hollow-kickstand-is-perfect-for-car-mode-v0-22tuub5a9b7f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4515996"></a><figcaption>Don't try this while moving.

Many reviews have less than an hour of playtime, meaning they either didn't spend much time in the game, they bounced off of the gameplay quickly, or some combination of both. Other reviews give positive feedback while calling other reviews disingenuous. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">FBC: Firebreak preview</a>, Mark Delaney called the FPS "a defiant, punk rock take on co-op shooters."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak is the first multiplayer game from the studio behind Control and Alan Wake. It features teams of three--each person has their own distinct kit--taking on hordes of enemies while trying to accomplish a variety of objectives. There are three jobs available at launch, each with a number of difficulty settings that expand the length of the job and number of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001" data-ratio="0.56884057971014" data-width="828" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001"></a><figcaption>FBC: Firebreak post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg"></figure><p>Many reviews cite a lack of content as a reason for their disappointment. Remedy has detailed two future updates, including additional jobs and maps that will come to the game this Fall and Winter. Fans looking for more from FBC: Firebreak could check back in after those updates are released.</p>
