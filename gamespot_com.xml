                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 had an update that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">teased the return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a>. In a skate park map called The Grind, there is a banner with the THPS logo and the date "03.04.25." Now, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> has a countdown clock to March 4, 2025, which may mean an announcement is imminent.</p><p>The very first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game was released by Activision in September 1999. Although the 25th anniversary has come and gone, Hawk revealed last year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he has been in contact with Activision</a> about doing something to celebrate that quarter century milestone. Hawk later confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the long-running franchise will continue</a>.</p><p>If there's news coming soon regarding the future of THPS, there are two likely options. The first is another remake like 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which helped revitalize interest in the games. There have been some predictions that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 could follow. However, a more enticing prospect would be a brand-new Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. The last fully original game in the series to hit consoles was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5. Additionally, there was a previous report that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">the next Tony Hawk game could arrive as soon as this summer</a>. Given the timing of the announcement, that seems very plausible.</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. Hawk has obviously moved on to better accommodations since then, but we're eager to see where the video game series can go with the full power of the current gen consoles.</p>

As a heavy sleeper, I use this setting.</p><p>Nintendo Alarmo displays scenes from the following games:</p><ul><li>Super Mario Odyssey</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</li><li>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</li><li>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</li><li>Splatoon 3</li><li>Pikmin 4</li><li>Ring Fit Adventure</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>Alarmo has several cool interactive features, too. The built-in motion sensor lets you snooze your alarm with a gesture or a button press (it's your choice). Nintendo characters from the games above can also respond to motion-detected gestures.</p><p>Throughout the day, Alarmo can be used to remind you what time it is by setting it to play music at specific intervals. It can also track your sleep and let you know how often you're tossing and turning, which provides a general idea of the quality of your sleep.</p><p>Alarmo is powered with the included USB-C cable. While it doesn't work wirelessly, the included coin battery saves your settings, so if you need to move the clock to another room or your power goes out, you can plug it back in without needing to set it up again.</p><p>Nintendo plans to release more updates, including new scenes, for Alarmo in the future. Updates are free, but you need to connect the device to Wi-Fi to download them.</p><p>In the world of very unofficial updates, it's <em>technically</em> possible to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hacker-puts-playable-version-of-doom-on-nintendo-alarmo/1100-6527574/" data-ref-id="1100-6527574">play Doom on Nintendo Alarmo</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">Although a big playtest similar to the 2XKO Alpha Lab 1 playtest now won't be coming until later this year, the update isn't all bad news. Rivera also officially revealed some new features coming to 2XKO. One major change will see the game's Pulse Fuse (which enables beginner-friendly autocombos) removed. However, autocombo functionality will instead be added as a toggleable option in the game's settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Rivera said this was done for two reasons. The first was so players could take advantage of the game's powerful Fuses while still using autocombos. The other reason is so that when playing as a team, each player could go with their own autocombo preference instead of being locked into using them or not via the Pulse Fuse.</p><p dir="ltr">There is also an entirely new Fuse coming, Sidekick, that will actually remove the tag functionality from Riot's tag-based fighter. Sidekick makes it so a team's point and assist character can't swap places, with the point character gaining bonus health to make up for the fact that they can't be tagged out. It essentially turns one character, or one player if playing co-op, into a support character only capable of using assist attacks, in a way channeling one of the core roles from League of Legends itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We received a ton of feedback from players who wanted an experience that felt like more of a support role where they could learn the game at their own pace, and we are excited to hear what you all think when you get a chance to check it out in the future," Rivera said.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO, which will be free-to-play, is slated to release sometime in 2025 but does not have an official release date. Players got their first major hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-alpha-lab-playtest-players-can-expect-a-decent-amount-of-jank-riot-says/1100-6525611/" data-ref-id="1100-6525611">2XKO as part of its Alpha Lab playtest in August 2024</a>, which was live for a little over a week. At the time, Riot warned players the playtest would have a "decent amount of jank" and work-in-progress elements. Those interested in joining future playtests can sign-up on the 2XKO <a href="https://alpha.2xko.riotgames.com/en-us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

                <p>Neil Druckmann is one of gaming's biggest names, and he's helped write and direct games in the critically and commercially successful franchises like The Last of Us and Uncharted. But Druckmann isn't always confident in what he's making while he's making it--with one exception.</p><p>During a speech at the DICE Summit recently attended by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/the-remarkable-banter-of-cory-barlog-and-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Druckmann said only with 2009's Uncharted 2: Among Thieves did he feel "confident" throughout the process. "Every other project where I was at the head of it, I was sure at many points that we were not going to succeed. You just have to power past that feeling," he said.</p><p>Part of what creates anxiety for Druckmann is the scope and scale of any given project, including staff and large budgets. "There's all this pressure," he said. "There's no formula for how to succeed. You can never guarantee success. All you can do is follow your instincts, follow the advice the team gives you, trust the process," he said.</p><p>The "process" for Naughty Dog is how the studios works together and vets ideas, Druckmann said, as well as iterating again and again.</p><p>"We know that our first idea is never the best one. We have to get to the seventh one to get something interesting, something unique. The first few, you've heard of it. It's something you've seen before," he said. "That's how you start to dig deeper. We know we’ll have to throw work away. That's part of our process. At times that can be frustrating for people, members of the team, ourselves. But going through it over and over again, that's how you get past your doubts. Doubt will always be there."</p><p>Druckmann also mentioned how having a schedule is critical to his working process, even if he might not personally enjoy sticking to a strict schedule. "I need it. The team needs it as well, because--it's not unique to me. It's just Naughty Dog. We're perfectionists. Without it we would just keep iterating," Druckmann said.</p><p>Druckmann is now directing Naughty Dog's new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while he may also be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us 3</a>. Beyond games, Druckmann worked alongside Craig Mazin on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hbo-finally-sets-a-date-for-the-last-of-us-season-2/1100-6529601/" data-ref-id="1100-6529601">The Last of Us Season 2, which comes to HBO in April.</a></p>
