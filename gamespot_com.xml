                <p dir="ltr">After a surprise unveiling during the Xbox Showcase last month, Invincible VS--a 3v3 fighting game from Skybound and Quarter Up, a new studio made up of multiple fighting game veteran devs--hadn't seen any new information come to light. Today, that drought ended with an explosion, as the abrasive Guardian of the Globe known as Rex Splode officially joins the playable roster.</p><p dir="ltr">Rex Splode's intro trailer shows off a few of his main combos and special moves, which utilize his ability to make anything he touches explode with kinetic energy. He's seen throwing exploding projectiles, turning himself into an explosive ball for multiple hits, and shoving two exploding sticks into an opponent's body before sending them off with a "polite" message.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Given that Elden Ring Nightreign already has a procedurally generated system, the modder notes that players may only notice the difference of the randomizer with variations of Night Bosses. "Under the hood, it's creating map patterns nearly from scratch and has a tremendous amount of freedom in its placements," they write. "In the future this can be extended to randomizing enemies and bosses within maps and in-depth placement customization."</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to the vanilla maps, the map randomizer has three option presets. One is similar to the base game, another adds randomization to item rewards, as well as the circle timing and size, while reducing repeating camps in consecutive runs, and another is "extra random" by removing certain guardrails.</p><p>The randomizer mod is also compatible with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/">Seamless Co-op mod</a> that enables two-player co-op, a feature that is missing from the base game, which can currently only be played solo or as a group of three. From Software has confirmed that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-co-op-confirmed-coming-at-a-later-date/1100-6532013/">official two-player mode will be coming</a> to Elden Ring Nightreign, although there is no date for when this will be. The developer's focus instead has been on an update that rolled out earlier this month to address <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1-01-4-is-here-and-delivers-even-more-bug-fixes/1100-6532907/">bug fixes</a>, with also no news yet on balance adjustments.</p>

                <p>It sounds like big changes are on the horizon for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>. A group of Diablo 4 content creators recently took to social media to announce they'd seen the future of developer Blizzard's ARPG after attending a special presentation, and that Blizzard has "been cooking" with what it has planned.</p><p dir="ltr">Content creators like Maxroll's <a href="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wudijo</a> and <a href="https://x.com/LuckyLuciano610/status/1943739809945534558" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lucky Luciano</a>, as well as <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944097949648114097" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Warlugtv</a> from Mobalytics, took to social media over the weekend to share their excitement and give Diablo 4 players some hope for the future based on what they had seen during a closed Blizzard presentation. Actual concrete details on what was shown weren't shared, but the social media reactions hint at updates or changes to Diablo 4's core systems as opposed to new features related to the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">second expansion slated to arrive in 2026</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth keeping in mind that some of these content creators have officially worked with Blizzard in the past, and it is currently unclear if any of them were compensated for attending the meeting and offering feedback.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Last night some people including myself got a glimpse of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DiabloIV?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DiabloIV</a> 's future. Take all the stuff I have been complaining about for the past 1.5 years and imagine I ACTUALLY felt heard 👀</p>  — wudijo (@wudijo) <a href="https://twitter.com/wudijo/status/1943990268035830074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Wudjio, for example, said he "felt heard" after seeing what's coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"Last night some people including myself got a glimpse of Diablo 4's future," Wudijo said. "Take all the stuff I have been complaining about for the past 1.5 years and imagine I actually felt heard."</p><p dir="ltr">Other reactions, like Lucky Luciano's, were more vague, but did allude to upcoming changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just got off a call with the Diablo team on upcoming changes to Diablo 4…Keep an eye out because they have been cooking and have a lot planned."</p><p dir="ltr">Warlugtv's reaction was largely positive as well, stating the presentation got them "super excited."</p><p dir="ltr">"I just got off a call with the Diablo 4 team! Look forward to a lot of stuff coming, let's hope it pans out the way it was discussed," Warlugtv said. "Super excited and actually makes me want to log in."</p><p dir="ltr">When asked on X if the plans Warlugtv saw during the presentation were intended for this year or for 2026, Warlugtv in a <a href="https://x.com/WarlugTv/status/1944135837450416160" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply</a> said "not sure."</p><p dir="ltr">What all changes are coming to Diablo 4, and when they will be arriving, are still largely a mystery then. However, we know one aspect of the ARPG likely to receive an update. Blizzard recently confirmed it was looking to "fix" the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-are-plans-to-fix-diablo-4-annoying-invulnerable-boss-fight-mechanics-blizzard-says/1100-6533029/" data-ref-id="1100-6533029">annoying invulnerable-boss mechanics</a>. The social media reactions also line up with a recent statement from Diablo's director of content and social marketing Adam Fletcher, who had this to say after Diablo 4's Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" rel="nofollow ">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9, which brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">permanent changes to Nightmare dungeons</a>, is live now, with its most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-patch-notes-reveal-increased-rewards-and-big-barbarian-buffs/1100-6533122/" data-ref-id="1100-6533122">patch bringing major Barbarian buffs</a> and increased rewards from certain activities.</p>

This stemmed from the game's newest client update for the Battlefield Labs test. This kind of thing is never meant to be seen by the public, so it's possible "Battlefield 6" is a placeholder name, or that there is no open beta and that the text itself is a placeholder.</p><p>Previous datamining efforts have revealed things like the first glimpse at a<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> rumored Battlefield battle royale mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alleged-battlefield-6-leak-shows-first-look-at-single-player-campaign/1100-6532642/" data-ref-id="1100-6532642">the game's campaign.</a></p><p>The Battlefield Labs test is closed, so you have to hope to be chosen to gain access. Tests are ongoing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">you can sign up right now.</a> EA has said it wants to invite more people to play Battlefield 6 before launch, but so far the company has not made any official announcements about an open beta. It wouldn't be surprising, though, a Battlefield 2042 and other entries in the series had open betas prior to launch.</p><p>EA will formally reveal the next Battlefield game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">at some point this summer</a>. Some fans thought there might be a reveal in June to join in with the numerous other gaming industry events, but that didn't happen. Now, some are theorizing that the official Battlefield 6 reveal might be accompanied by an announcement of an open beta, but none of this is confirmed as of yet.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new entry in the franchise since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a poorly received entry in the series that EA management said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">suffered in part due to the remote-working experience during COVID.</a> It was, however, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">No. 5 best-selling game in the US in 2021.</a></p><p>In other news, EA and DICE have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-add-something-close-to-an-ultimate-ability-for-each-class/1100-6533119/" data-ref-id="1100-6533119">discussed ultimate-like abilities coming to Battlefield 6</a> and defended the decision to not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-brings-back-controversial-change-from-battlefield-2042/1100-6531734/" data-ref-id="1100-6531734"> class-locked weapons</a>.</p>

                <p>Following observations last week that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blue-archive-pc-release-appears-to-break-steam-rules/1100-6533084/" data-ref-id="1100-6533084">Blue Archive PC release</a> could be breaking Steam policies, Nexon has announced that it has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3557620/view/514089434949353483?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">terminated a controversial in-game event</a>. The Steam event incentivized players to leave reviews for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-archive/" data-ref-id="5000-527462">Blue Archive</a> on Valve's storefront, which goes against the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steamworks documentation</a>. Alongside the event's termination, no rewards earned for reaching the goal will be distributed.</p><p>In a statement posted to the Steam news section for Blue Archive, Nexon says that "following the launch of the Steam client, we prepared this event and rewards for all Senseis as a way to create a better service together through your valuable feedback. However, during the process of announcing the reward distribution linked to review submissions, we discovered that certain aspects could potentially conflict with platform policies. As a result, we have decided to terminate the event early."</p><p>It continues, "Please understand that, in order to comply with platform policies, the rewards for this event will not be distributed." Nexon goes on to promise that it will "take even greater care" when planning future events to ensure it is not going against any other platform policies, while striving to "provide a better service" for its players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531901" data-ratio="0.635" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4531901"></a><figcaption>The Blue Archive Steam event has been terminated early.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4531901-blue-archive-steam.jpg"></figure><p><span>Blue Archive was released on Steam last week, where it peaked at over 22,000 concurrent players. Alongside the reward event, it also amassed more than 10,000 Steam reviews, and despite the review event being terminated this number continues to rise. The game maintains a "very positive" overall rating on Steam so far.</span></p><p>The cute anime characters of Blue Archive are also collaborating with World of Warships soon, bringing new ships, camouflages, and voice-acted captains to the game.
