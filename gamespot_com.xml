                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> servers are down, but don't worry. It's all part of the plan. Fortnite servers will be back up soon; here's what you need to know.</p><p>With Fortnite's latest all-Marvel season coming to an end, it's time to look ahead to what's next, and it's poised to be another nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans. Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 is imminent. Like Fortnite OG last November, this is poised to be a return (and remix, of course) of the original Chapter 2 island, complete with skins, weapons, loot, and more all fitting of that era of Epic's massive game.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in this year's massive Remix season, though Epic has already revealed it will unfold for just one month before another Chapter finale event ushers in another new island in December.</p><p>The Chapter 2 map coming back will be, for some players, a bigger deal than the OG map last year, but all we can do now is wait until Epic brings Fortnite back online. But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, November 2--though there have been major exceptions.</p><p>Earlier this year, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day. But that was a very unusual situation and shouldn't be expected to be repeated often.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751"></a><figcaption>A new blast from the past is coming very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg"></figure><p>Once the game does return, Remix Chapter 2 will introduce a whole host of changes such as a new (well, <em>returning</em>) map inspired by Chapter 2, vehicles fitting of that era--or perhaps no vehicles at all at first, since cars weren't added until Chapter 2 Season 3--as well as a new Remix Chapter 2 Pass that is likely to celebrate some of that era's favorite characters with mash-ups, such as Meowscles and Midas being combined into one character.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 right here.</p>
