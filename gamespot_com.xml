The new mode allows players to choose from two heroes as voted on by their team, letting players hit the field as one of them. This means that you can field an entire team of Iron Men or Venoms, and some of the other combinations here are <em>wild</em>.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="778581427" data-promo-id="0"

                <p>PlayStation has unveiled a new beta program that will make it easier to access game betas, test out new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a> and PlayStation App features early, and more.</p><p>Aptly called the "Beta Program at PlayStation," this new initiative is similar to the Xbox Insider program Microsoft currently runs for its gaming hardware and apps. Sony Interactive Entertainment's Sid Shuman describes this program as "an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas" in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>. Essentially, players can now register at the program's official website and be in the loop on future beta initiatives by Sony.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="1077" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759"></a><figcaption>The official key art for the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg"></figure><p>By signing up for the Beta Program at PlayStation, players will essentially be enrolled for a chance to gain beta access to future software betas that Sony holds for PlayStation. The PlayStation Blog post specifically calls out beta tests for PS5 and PC games, new PS5 console and PlayStation App features, and new UI capabilities on PlayStation.com. Companies like Sony need to thoroughly test games and software updates before they release them to the masses. This new program gives Sony a way to involve fans in that process.</p><p>While the website is down as of the writing of this article, the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a website of its own </a>where interested PlayStation fans can sign up for free. All you need is to meet the age and region requirements and to have an active PlayStation Network account with no restrictions or violations currently applied to it.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Spring is almost here, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hello-kitty-island-adventure/">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a> is kicking things off early via the annual sakura-themed Springtime Celebration. The Springtime Celebration--which is live now on all platforms--allows players to join Kitty White (and her friends) to collect sakura petals, which can be found all over the island.</p><p dir="ltr">But with winter's chill still in the air, the game has also dropped a new content update for Apple Arcade players: Update 2.4: Snow &amp; Sound. Players on other platforms will have to wait a while before they gain access to this update.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YgYMYXoBmg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_YgYMYXoBmg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Hello Kitty Island Adventure Springtime Celebration runs through April 7 and allows players to exchange sakura petals--which can be found all over the island--for new outfits and decor items. Tuxedosam's Shop and My Melody's Gift Shop will also be stocked up with unique Spring-themed clothing and furniture for players to peruse and purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.4: Snow &amp; Sound is now live on Apple Arcade, but developer Sunblink Entertainment says the update will be "coming soon" to players on Nintendo Switch and PC. Players who have access to the Snow &amp; Sound update will notice something new atop Icy Peak: houses! Players can work to repair Snow Village, building warm little cabins and discovering new collectible critters, fish, and furniture.</p><p dir="ltr">The Snow &amp; Sound update is also introducing some changes to City Town, including new quests from Usahana, the ability to open a music store, and opportunities for players to increase their friendship with Usahana, adding more light and color to City Town. Players can also decorate the cabins they build, which will provide them with a chance to meet new friends like Ganta, Kyorosuke, Noberun, and Washimi.</p><p dir="ltr">Sunblink has not yet announced an official Snow &amp; Sound release date for players on PC and console.</p>
