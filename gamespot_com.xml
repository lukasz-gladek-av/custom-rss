                <p>Riot Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/league-of-legends-retail-launch-review/1900-6239387/" data-ref-id="1900-6239387">League of Legends</a> has been around since 2009, and it has attracted a large group of fans from around the world since its release. And when those fans aren't happy, they aren't afraid to be vocal about it. Some of Riot's most recent moves--including the removal of Hextech chests--angered players so much that the company is now walking back that decision as well as a few other unpopular changes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAVa467pHl8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sAVa467pHl8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video above--and in the accompanying <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-hextech-chests-getting-champs-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Riot's site</a>--Senior Vice President Andrei Van Roon and League of Legends executive producer Paul Bellezza explained why the company is reversing its recent decisions. Bellezza noted that their choices had eroded some of the trust that fans had for Riot, and they want to fix that.</p><p>The first step in rebuilding that trust is coming in next week's patch, which will restore Hextech chests to the game. Eight chests will be available through the free seasonal pass, while players can earn two additional chests through the game's Honor system. The dev post notes that the Honor system is still being worked out, but it's meant to reward players who are good teammates and respectful opponents.</p><p>League of Legends' Exalted skin for Sahn Uzal Mordekaiser is also being delayed to give the developers more time to "deliver on its core fantasy." Fans have been very critical about the Radiant Serpent Sett and Fractured Arcane Jinx Exalted skins, which is why Riot plans to put greater effort into future Exalted skins to meet players' expectations.</p><p>Riot is also reducing the cost of unlocking champions through League of Legends' in-game currency, Blue Essence. As of the next patch, the price for all champions will drop by 50% in the hope that players can more easily expand their roster with new and older characters.</p><p>Earlier this month, Riot announced that the League of Legends fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/2xko/" data-ref-id="5000-503365">2XKO</a>, won't be getting the large playtest in March that was originally planned. Instead, a smaller playtest will be held while the company builds its infrastructure for a larger test later this year. League of Legends also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcanes-mel-officially-joins-league-of-legends-with-a-new-noxian-look/1100-6528699/" data-ref-id="1100-6528699">added Mel Medarda to the roster</a>, following her larger role in the second and final season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a>. Mel was also featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-cinematic-from-arcane-studio-continues-shows-story/1100-6528678/" data-ref-id="1100-6528678">a recently released cinematic</a> that appears to take place after the series finale of Arcane.</p>

                <p>Since the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">Sims 4</a> update released, players have noticed some odd bugs--even by the Sims' standards. As of the latest patch, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-update-adds-burglars-back-to-the-series/1100-6529708/" data-ref-id="1100-6529708">burglar Robin Banks</a> to the game, child and baby Sims may appear pregnant, have beer-bellies, or be oddly muscular.</p><p>Some players on The Sims subreddit, as picked up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-latest-patch-makes-some-children-appear-pregnant-players-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, noticed that some of their child sims were suddenly appearing pregnant--in one case, the user claimed the bug was affecting every male child in their game.</p><p>The bug appears to be visual only--the child Sims have thankfully not been given the actual pregnancy state and are not about to give birth to other Sims--but in a game like this, visuals are important to most players.</p><p>Other posts on the Sims subreddit suggest there are more visual glitches affecting young Sims, with one post showing a collection of strangely buff babies, and another showing a child Sim who looks like he's been hitting the gym.</p><p>One Reddit user theorized that the game is somehow mixing up child and adult body types, mistakenly applying adult musculature, beer bellies, or pregnant bellies to child and infant Sims. While it's easy to fix an adult Sim who's been assigned the wrong body type, child Sims' bodies can't be customized, making this bug difficult to get around. Even aging up and then regressing the Sim doesn't appear to reset the body-distorting bug, according to players' experiments.</p><p>The Sims has a history of unintentionally hilarious bugs, like the one that gave infants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-bug-is-turning-babies-into-monsters/1100-6512406/" data-ref-id="1100-6512406">freakishly long limbs</a> back when the new life state was first introduced, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-years-into-the-sims-ea-is-still-making-the-same-mistakes/1100-6529270/" data-ref-id="1100-6529270">EA's poor track record</a> of fixing bugs means players are often anxious about how long disruptive bugs will stick around. While this bug hasn't been officially acknowledged yet, EA encourages players to report bugs through its forums, where <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/toddlerinfantschild-body-and-face-distortions/11928891" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a thread</a> has been started to catalogue body distortion in child Sims.</p><p>EA recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-and-sims-2-legacy-editions-are-full-of-bugs-according-to-players/1100-6529205/" data-ref-id="1100-6529205">re-released The Sims and The Sims 2</a> as legacy editions, including all their DLC packs. However, these re-releases also launched with a number of bugs that have frustrated players. A Sims community manager has said that the legacy game bugs are currently being investigated.</p>
