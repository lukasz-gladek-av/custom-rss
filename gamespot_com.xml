                <p>From Software's games tend to be challenging for most players, and the developer is making things even harder with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">Deep of Night</a> mode. Before that launches later this week, Elden Ring Nightreign has received patch 1.02.2 with new bug fixes and gameplay tweaks. From Software has also shared a video that breaks down some of the changes coming in Deep of Night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-qY-Lb37eE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M-qY-Lb37eE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>One of the ways Deep of Night will keep players on edge is that they won't know which Night Lord they're actually facing until the battle begins. Flexibility is going to be the key to overcoming those battles, and the video suggests preparing relic presets before going into those fights.</p><p>More powerful enemies will appear throughout Deep of Night, and players will have the opportunity to pick up weapons that can dispatch them. However, those weapons will have a detrimental effect on player characters that may make battles even more grueling. As players go deeper into Deep of Night, their enemies will become increasingly difficult.</p><p>In the patch notes, From Software indicated that Everdark Sovereign Libra may be a little easier going forward because his Condemned warriors will now have less damage negation and they will drop items that can help players in-battle.</p><p>Guardian class heroes will be receiving increased strength and dexterity when leveling up, as well as a larger range for their ultimate art's attack. The patch also appears to penalize players who drop out of matches, even if their connection was disrupted. But players can remove the penalty if they rejoin the session.</p><p>Deep of Night will go live on September 11.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> latest update just introduced a fan-favorite game mode that will have players nostalgic for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-43545">Halo: Reach</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, Invasion has made its Halo Infinite debut, just in time for the 15th anniversary of Bungie's last Halo game on September 14. The asymmetrical, one-sided objective mode originally saw Spartans and Elites attacking or defending in Halo: Reach, with the objective for the attackers changing depending on what phase of the map was currently being played. Each team also sported unique weapon loadout options depending on whether they were on the Spartan or Elite side, further emphasizing the mode's asymmetrical nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXwreSlUctI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CXwreSlUctI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As broken down in a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/invasion" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo Waypoint blog</a>, the Invasion in Halo Infinite is mostly as players remember, minus the ability to play as Elites. Instead, one team will play as Spartans affected by a malignant Banished AI and will sport more Banished/Covenant weapon loadouts similar to that used by the Elite team in Halo: Reach. The mode also originally featured the ability to spawn on a "buddy" on the same team, a feature returning for Halo: Infinite's version of the game mode.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be six Invasion maps made by the game's Forge community, two of which, Breakpoint and Recovery, are remakes of Halo: Reach Invasion maps.</p><p dir="ltr">Invasion is part of Halo Infinite's Warpath update, which additionally adds a new Operation Pass that includes the new Lancer armor set and additional weapon cosmetics. The Operation Pass is available for free until October 7, though the paid premium version of the pass doesn't expire and can be worked towards after that date.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, developer Halo Studios added the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-update-brings-back-something-missing-for-15-years/1100-6533677/" data-ref-id="1100-6533677">Falcon to Halo Infinite as part of its Fall Update 2025</a>, a flying vehicle that last appeared in Halo: Reach. That update additionally added a new weapon, the Vestige Carbine, that is in some ways similar to Halo: Reach's Needle Rifle.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the next entry in the Halo franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">Microsoft has confirmed multiple new Halo games</a> are in the works but haven't shared more details. Halo Studios (formerly 343) revealed last year that future games in the series would be built using Unreal Engine 5. Halo Studios has <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/06/halo-studios-confirms-major-reveal-to-take-place-later-this-year" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased some kind of announcement for later this year</a>, but it remains to be seen what it could be.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> in June saw Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer allude to a new Halo title in 2026 as part of Xbox's 25th anniversary, stating fans would see "the return of a classic that's been with us since the beginning." Many believed Spencer's comments to be referring to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">long-rumored remake of Halo: Combat Evolved</a>.</p>
