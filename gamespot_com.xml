          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty's Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p>Extremely early development on Cyberpunk 2 began several years ago, and pre-production generally means that more pieces need to fall in place--from concept art to staffing and multiple other crucial factors--before work kicks off in earnest.</p><p>The game title could also change in time, but that's hardly uncommon in the industry today. The Cyberpunk 2 title reveal was done during an investor announcement after all--suggesting that this is in fact a working title that doesn't give away any concrete details--and a formal reveal for the game could see that title altered to better reflect what the sequel is about.</p><p>CDPR described Cyberpunk 2 as being in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-an-update-on-how-its-coming-along/1100-6520849/">"early stages of development,"</a> back in 2024, as the company first focused on building a strong foundation for the people tasked with producing it. Senior staffers from the original game--including game director Gabriel Amatangelo and associate game director Paweł Sasko--are leading development at CDPR's new Boston studio, and the company has hired experienced people from Blizzard, IO Interactive, and Massive Entertainment to join the Cyberpunk 2 team.</p><p>Details are slim at this point in the game's development journey, but what we do know is that it will be built inside of Unreal Engine 5--Cyberpunk 2077 was developed in CDPR's internal Red Engine--and Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/">players will get to explore a second city in some capacity</a>.</p><p>While Cyberpunk 2 is still a long way from being seen, the first game and its award-winning expansion Phantom Liberty are being bundled together as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, which will likely add to the game's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-much-cyberpunk-2077-has-earned-so-far/1100-6522250/">impressive lifetime sales figure of 25 million units sold</a>.</p>

That future for Season of Discovery is somewhat bittersweet, as we've made the decision to slow down on Season of Discovery and begin work on our next major project in the original WoW design space."</p><p dir="ltr">He said Blizzard has "big plans and big ambitions" for its next WoW Classic project, plans that will require Blizzard to take the time to "get in the proverbial kitchen and cook," he said. Blizzard will use that time to further shape and iterate on ideas from Season of Discovery into "something truly exciting."</p><p dir="ltr">What that next major project will be is still unclear, but many WoW Classic fans are assuming (and hoping) it's what the community, and even Blizzard itself, has for years referred to as Classic+. It's an idea that calls for essentially a new version of WoW Classic with new content like class changes, raids, and zones. Rather than progress to a new expansion and landmass as was the case originally, Classic+ would remain in the core regions of Azeroth and explore locations that never made it into the original version of WoW, like Mount Hyjal and others. In theory, it's something that would be similar to Season of Discovery, but less radical in some of its class changes and intended to continue as an ongoing game rather than a seasonal server meant to run its course.</p><p dir="ltr">Greenfield said the original plan for Season of Discovery, which added new abilities and content to the over 20-year-old original version of WoW, was for it to end with the release of the game's retooled Naxxramas raid and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-wow-most-famous-pieces-of-cut-content-is-playable-today/1100-6529076/" data-ref-id="1100-6529076">introduction of a new dungeon, the Karazhan Crypts</a>, in January 2025. Instead, the team decided to realize one more unfulfilled dream, releasing an entirely new raid several months later, the Scarlet Enclave.</p><p dir="ltr">It's that new raid where Blizzard is now offering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-away-free-wow-classic-mists-of-pandaria-boosts-but-youll-have-to-earn-it/1100-6531833/" data-ref-id="1100-6531833">free level 85 character boost to use in the upcoming Mists of Pandaria Classic</a> for players who defeat its first boss. Greenfield said the character boost serves as a "capstone" for Season of Discovery and a way for players to jump straight into a new version of Classic now that Season of Discovery development is winding down. While development is slowing for Season of Discovery, Greenfield said it has no plans to shut down servers, and that they will remain online for many months if not years to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we think of the impact that Season of Discovery will ultimately have on World of Warcraft, we think about how it helped prove something that a lot of us already knew: there is an enormous appetite for new experiences set against the backdrop of original World of Warcraft," Greenfield said.</p>

The battle royale's next live event, titled Death Star Sabotage, kicks off on Saturday, June 7, at 2 PM ET // 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, and it will have players participate in an organized assault against the planet-killing space station, which has its sights aimed at the island.</p><p>Developer Epic Games doesn't detail what the event will entail in a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, but players can queue up for the event two hours before it begins, flying around in X-wings or TIE Fighters as a countdown ticks down. The event will support parties of up to four players.</p>

<p>In the lead-up to the event, Epic Games is providing players with several new goodies and toys to use in battle. Following an update scheduled for May 29, players can enter rift gates in Battle Royale or Zero Build modes to take control of a Star Destroyer's Turbolaser. Players will fire the destructive weapon from orbit, destroying any structures and damaging opponents that its lasers hit.</p><p>Players can redeem an "Assault on the Death Star" loading screen and Captain Phasma's "Quicksilver Baton Spear" as a pickaxe as login rewards between June 3 at 9 AM ET and June 10 at 9 AM ET. Fortnite fans can also nab rewards through Twitch; starting May 29, viewers of any streams by creators with the "Galactic Battle" Twitch extension can earn a bundle of five sprays, each representing a different Star Wars faction, to use in-game.</p><p>Additionally, simply linking your Epic and Twitch accounts will yield you a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a> emoticon. Participants of the Twitch event will also get a loading screen if a community goal is met, and according to Epic, those players "might get a jump on what's coming in Death Star Sabotage."</p><p>Despite its relatively short length, this Star Wars mini-season of Fortnite has been quite eventful, introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">controversial Darth Vader AI character</a> and welcoming mobile players back to the game after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">its return to the iOS App Store</a>. It's unknown what the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next season of Fortnite</a> will look like, but rumors suggest the battle royale is shifting from a galaxy far, far away to superhero-themed antics.</p>

                <p>Former Grand Theft Auto lead developer Leslie Benzies had an ugly exit from Rockstar Games nearly a decade ago when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-gta-5-exec-suing-take-two-claims-hes-owed-1/1100-6438762/" data-ref-id="1100-6438762">he sued its parent company, Take-Two Interactive</a>. Benzies subsequently co-founded Build a Rocket Boy and developed a GTA-like game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/" data-ref-id="1100-6529472">MindsEye</a>, which is releasing next month. Now, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a "concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</p><p>Gerhard recently took part in a Q&amp;A session on Discord (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), where he agreed with the potentially explosive allegation that the negative responses to the game "were financed by someone." Gerhard's response to that suggestion was, "100%... Doesn't take much to guess who."</p><p>Although Gerhard didn't back down from his initial implication, he later clarified that he isn't accusing any specific players of being paid to bad mouth the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbhEMXn_osc" data-width="854" data-height="480" data-video-start="23">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rbhEMXn_osc?start=23" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I just said that there is a concerted effort by some people that don't want to see Leslie or Build A Rocket Boy to be successful that are making a concerted effort to trash the game and the studio. Its [sic] pretty easy to see the bots and the repeated replies to any content that we put out."</p><p>Gerhard went on to suggest that "there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes" for MindsEye, but didn't elaborate beyond that.</p><p>MindsEye will be released on June 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game puts players in control of Jacob Diaz, a former soldier who has a implant in his head that's called the MindsEye. That device gives Jacob the ability to control drones and a few other tricks. It also shows him glimpses of a mission he can't remember, which results in an unknown faction attempting to kill him before he can piece that part of his past together.</p>

                <p>Yuri Lowenthal, a voice actor who portrayed Yosuke Hanamura in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/persona-4-golden/" data-ref-id="5000-115427">Persona 4</a>, seemingly revealed that a Persona 4 remake was in the works in a Bluesky post about not being invited back. Atlus has still not confirmed a remake of this RPG classic is in the works.</p><p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remarked on Bluesky</a>. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p>Rumors of a Persona 4 remake have been swirling ever since Persona 3 Reload launched last February. These rumors have gained traction in recent months, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jvwo7r/according_to_extas1s_gears_collection_silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers like extas1s</a> claiming that it will be revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase. Atlus has not commented on these rumors at all, though, so Lowenthal's comments are the first we've heard about a Persona 4 remake from anyone who could potentially be in the know about it.</p><p>If true, it's disappointing to hear that Lownethal won't return to portray Yosuke in a potential remake of Persona 4. It would line up with Atlus' approach to voice acting for Persona 3 Reload, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reloaded-will-feature-an-entirely-new-voice-cast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no voice actors from the original</a> portrayed their characters in that remake either. Lownethal's comments suggest that this is a deliberate choice on Atlus' part, not related to voice actor availability, and that other Persona 4 voice actors also won't be returning to portray their iconic characters.</p><p>If the rumors are true and a Persona 4 remake is real, it seems like Atlus could reveal it during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. Fans of classic RPGs also have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-screenshots/2900-6619/" data-ref-id="2900-6619">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake</a> to look forward to this year.</p>
