                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040">Fallout 76</a> dataminers discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-leak-reveals-game-is-probably-getting-a-highly-requested-feature/1100-6524749/" data-ref-id="1100-6524749">camp pets were on the way to the game</a>. Now, as part of the Gleaming Depths update going live today, pets are indeed arriving in the form of a Bombay Cat and a white German Shepherd. And while players can't keep more than one C.A.M.P. pet at a time, they can pet their adorable feline or canine companions.</p><p>The new update is Fallout 76's biggest expansion to date, and also kicks off Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This season is focused on the Enclave, a former "deep-state faction of the United States government" that is now controlled by M.O.D.U.S., an AI supercomputer. M.O.D.U.S. and its followers plan to use science to revitalize the country no matter how many experiments they have to run along the way.</p><p>The arrival of these mad scientists comes with some mad-science weapons including a Tesla Cannon, as well as the Enclave Lab Coat and a M.O.D.U.S. Terminal Vending Machine that can be set up in the player's camp. Some of the other available items include an Enclave Grill Cooking Station and Enclave Hazmat Paint. Players will also be able to use a Plasma Core Recharger instead of buying new plasma cores every time they run out.</p><p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and Bethesda teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">players will be able to control a Ghoul in 2025</a>. That feature isn't included with the new update, but it's something that's on the update calendar for March 2025 with the start of Season 20. The rest of the details about the Gleaming Depths update are below.</p><h2>MUTATED PUBLIC EVENTS UPDATE</h2><p>We have added five public events to the Mutated Public Events playlist. These events are:</p><ul><li>Campfire Tales: Volatile and Toxic Blood Mutations</li><li>Free Range: Resilient and Swift-Footed Mutations</li><li>Project Paradise: Active Camouflage and Resilient Mutations</li><li>Beasts of Burden: Freezing Touch and Reflective Mutations</li><li>Safe and Sound: Swift-Focused and Danger Cloud Mutations</li></ul><h2>PERK CARDS BALANCING UPDATE</h2><p>The Gleaming Depths update releases with some substantial balancing changes to a handful of Perk Cards.Our goal was to take generally underperforming perks and make them more interesting and easier to incorporate into your builds by removing some extra ranks, lowering the cost, and changing their effect to scale with the related primary stat.</p><ul><li>Adamantium Skeleton  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Limb Damage Reduction effect now scales with Endurance</li></ul></li><li>All Night Long  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Rank 1 Perk Point cost increased from 1 to 2</li><li>New effect: The positive effects of pre-war alcohol last twice as long</li></ul></li><li>Batteries Included  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li><li>Bloodsucker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Moved from Charisma to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 gains the effects of the former Rank 3 effect</li><li>Healing bonus increased from 150% to 200%</li><li>Additional effect: Benefits now also apply to Cannibal</li></ul></li><li>Bullet Shield  <ul><li>Moved from Strength to Endurance</li><li>Added a 4th rank.</li><li>New effect: 5% chance per rank to Deflect ranged attacks for 6 seconds when firing a heavy weapon.</li></ul></li><li>Cannibal  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Increased the healing received and hunger restored at Rank 1</li></ul></li><li>Cap Collector  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now applies to containers and corpses, not just Cap Stashes</li><li>New effect: The amount of Caps found scales with Luck</li></ul></li><li>Evasive  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Evade Chance based on Agility</li></ul></li><li>First Aid  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now affects Stimpak Diffuser</li><li>New effect: Stimpak healing scales with Intelligence</li></ul></li><li>Four Leaf Clover  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Misses in VATS contribute to the Critical Meter based on Luck</li></ul></li><li>Hard Bargain  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Rank 1 now grants +7 Charisma while bartering with NPCs</li></ul></li><li>Iron Stomach  <ul><li>Now also increases Energy Resistance</li></ul></li><li>Junk Shield  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>Now works while in Power Armor</li><li>Additional effect: Now also scales with Luck</li></ul></li><li>Lifegiver  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Improves HP gained from Endurance</li></ul></li><li>Lone Wanderer  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: AP Regen and defense bonus based on Charisma</li></ul></li><li>Natural Resistance  <ul><li>No longer increases Energy Resistance</li></ul></li><li>Night Eyes  <ul><li>Removed requirement for the time of day</li></ul></li><li>Ordnance Express  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li><li>Pharmacist  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Radiation healing scales with Intelligence</li><li>No longer required to craft Disease Cures or Water Filters</li></ul></li><li>Professional Drinker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li></ul></li><li>Ricochet  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Deflect chance based on Luck. Deflect grants a chance to reflect 100% of the damage of ranged attacks back to the attacker and reduces the damage you take from the attack by 50%. Deflect chance receives a bonus while wearing Heavy Armor or Power Armor (+50% multiplier). While in Power Armor, the amount of damage reflected is doubled (200%).</li></ul></li><li>Serendipity  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Evade Chance while under 30% life, based on Luck. Evade provides a chance to avoid all incoming damage from direct attacks. Evade can happen once every second and the cooldown is now increased by armor. Please note, Evade cannot happen when over encumbered or while in Power Armor.  <ul><li>Armor increases Evade cooldown at the following rates:</li><li>Light Armor: +0.1 second per piece</li><li>Medium Armor: +0.2 seconds per piece</li><li>Heavy Armor: +0.4 seconds per piece</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Starched Genes  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 2 to 1</li><li>Moved from Luck to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now provides the benefits of the former Rank 2</li></ul></li><li>Thru-Hiker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Moved from Agility to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li></ul><h2>ADJUSTMENTS TO EXPLOSION VFX</h2><p>We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions throughout the game. This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage is dealt.A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions). Please be sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen flashing, if there’s any additional explosions that we should adjust, or if some explosions no-longer feel impactful and satisfying to use.</p><h2>PLAYER WEAPONS</h2><ul><li>Artillery Piece (Workshop)</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher / M79</li><li>Baseball Grenade</li><li>Broadsider</li><li>Bug Grenade</li><li>Cryo Arrow</li><li>Cryo Grenade</li><li>Cryo Mine</li><li>Explosions (all types) from weapons using the Explosive legendary mod</li><li>Fatman</li><li>Fatman MIRV (from individual projectiles)</li><li>Flaming Arrow</li><li>Floater Flamer Grenade</li><li>Floater Freezer Grenade</li><li>Frag Grenade</li><li>Grand Finale (Broadsider)</li><li>Hack and Slash (Legendary Perk)</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Cryo Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Napalm Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Plasma Payload</li><li>Missile Launcher</li><li>Missile Turret</li><li>Orbital Strike Beacon</li><li>Plasma Grenade</li><li>Pulse Grenade</li><li>Troglocide</li></ul><h2>NPC WEAPONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h2><p>NPCs’ use of player weapons listed above will also be affected.</p><ul><li>Exploding Cars &amp; other Civilian Vehicles</li><li>Explosive Rounds from Turrets</li><li>Floater Freezer Death</li><li>Fusion Core Meltdown (Robots)</li><li>Gas Canisters</li><li>Invaders from Beyond UFO Missile Strikes</li><li>Mole Rat Landminer</li><li>Robot Death Explosion</li><li>Scorched Exterminator Plasma Launcher</li><li>Super Mutant Suicider Mini-Nuke</li><li>Turret Death Explosion</li><li>Various destructible objects such as machinery in Grafton Steel and The Foundry (The Pitt)</li><li>Vertibird Death Explosion</li><li>Vertibot Death Explosion</li></ul><h2>COMBAT BALANCE</h2><p>The notes you see below are a continuation of the combat rebalancing work that we began during the Skyline Valley patch. This is an ongoing process we will continue to do combat rebalancing work into next year.</p><ul><li>The cooldown of evade effects now scales based on how much damage was avoided</li><li>The durability of armor has been increased</li><li>Slightly increased the chance to learn to craft weapon mods via scrapping</li><li>Slightly increased the amount of Steel and Ballistic fiber that weapon-using enemies can drop</li><li>Balance adjustments for Communist and Liberators</li><li>Added additional information about Damage Types and Damage over Time effects to the Help menu</li><li>Reduced the damage of the Auto Axe: 31 --&gt; 24</li><li>Adjusted the damage of the V63 Zweihaender: 85/45 --&gt; 64/64</li></ul><h2>ARMOR</h2><ul><li>Brotherhood Recon and Secret Service are now classified as Heavy Armor</li><li>Civil Engineer, Arctic Marine, Marine Armor, and Trapper Armors are now classified as Medium Armor</li><li>Covert Scout Armor, Solar Armor, Thorn Armor, Urban Scout Armor, Forest Scout Armor, and Wood Armors are now classified as Light Armor</li><li>Botsmith armor is now classified as Heavy Armor</li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><p>We have made changes to Damage and AP Costs for many weapons which primarily focuses on improving cases where weapons don’t perform well enough to meet players’ expectations.</p><h2>DAMAGE BUFFS</h2><p>These values represent the weapon at its maximum level (45 or 50, depending on the weapon). Lower-level values have similar increases in damage. Damage for the following weapons has been increased:</p><ul><li>10mm Pistol: 28 -&gt; 31</li><li>44 [revolver]: 60 -&gt; 72</li><li>Black Powder Pistol: 176 -&gt; 216</li><li>Black Powder Rifle: 180 -&gt;

14  <ul><li>Dev Note: The Anchorage Ace no-longer gains an additional AP cost benefit beyond the Reflex Sight’s 15% reduction.</li></ul></li><li>.50 Cal Machine Gun: 30 -&gt; 12</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher: 30 -&gt;

This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</p><h2>HUMAN(ISH) CREATURE &amp; WEAPON BALANCE</h2><p>Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to account for this change (see notes below).When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon alongside some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that players can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons. Increases have also been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world, so now you will also have more components at your disposal.We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to account for the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance to learn Legendary weapon mods.</p><ul><li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants):  <ul><li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures whose attacks already could scale to level 100.</li></ul></li><li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player grenades is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases, at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.</li></ul></li><li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li></ul></li><li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li><li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.  <ul><li>Dev Note: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li></ul></li><li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>CREATURE BALANCE</h2><p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates:</p><ul><li>Floater Freezer  <ul><li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core damage).</li></ul></li><li>Floater Flamer  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li></ul></li><li>Floater gnasher  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li></ul></li><li>Alien Invader  <ul><li>Reduced health</li><li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li></ul></li><li>Lesser Devil  <ul><li>Increased damage.</li></ul></li><li>Bloodbug  <ul><li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li></ul></li><li>Thrasher  <ul><li>Increased melee attack damage especially at higher levels.</li><li>Decreased Sonic Gobble attack damage at lower levels.</li><li>Now weakest to fire damage and resistant to radiation, energy, and poison damage</li></ul></li><li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</li><li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced. In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough damage to kill the creature.</li><li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret has lost most of its health.</li></ul><h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2><p>When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu that includes the new settings you see below. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of these settings in the future, go to Settings &gt; Accessibility.Speech-to-Text</p><ul><li>Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all voice communication from other players in the area.</li><li>Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last message has been received.</li><li>Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window.</li></ul><p>Screen Narration</p><ul><li>When the setting is ON, you’ll hear the audible description of emotes from other players in the area. For example: “[Player] wants to team up!”</li></ul><p>UI Navigation</p><ul><li>Digital Input  <ul><li>Several screens relied completely on analog stick input and that has been addressed to allow keyboard control on PCs and d-pad control on consoles. This includes the Challenges, Scoreboard, Map, and Character Creation screens.</li></ul></li><li>Analog Input  <ul><li>Several screens didn’t support analog inputs to navigate the UI, so that analog functionality has been added to the Favorites Wheel and Social Panel.</li></ul></li><li>Single Key Presses  <ul><li>Fast Travel Countdown Cancel – Now allows a single button command to cancel the fast travel instead of clicking both the left and right analog sticks.</li><li>Social Menu – Allows a single button command to enter the Social Menu instead of having to hold CTRL-TAB on PC.</li></ul></li></ul>

                <p>Amazon has revealed all the PC games that'll be available this month through its Prime Gaming service, and in total, you can look forward to 18 games in December.

                <p>According to one of the top bosses at PlayStation, the rise in artificial intelligence technologies in game development has the potential to "revolutionize" gaming, but only as a tool that assists humans.</p><p>"Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial," Hermen Hulst told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>.</p><p>He went on to predict that the gaming industry will see a "dual demand," split between AI-driven "innovative experiences" and a second for "handcrafted, thoughtful content."</p><p>There are concerns among industry developers about the potential for advancements to AI ending up taking jobs from humans. This is part of the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">why video game voice actors are now on strike</a> and why some labor unions are calling on workers to organize.</p><p>Another video game executive, Christoph Hartmann of Amazon, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">he believes AI could replace "boring" parts of video game jobs</a>, including localization as he sees it. However, Hartmann and others believe the rise in AI technologies will create enough new jobs to offset any potential job losses. EA's Andrew Wilson previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-boss-explains-why-ai-will-be-good-for-gaming/1100-6518421/" data-ref-id="1100-6518421">the agricultural and industrial revolutions took many jobs but created countless more</a>, and he sees an AI revolution following a similar playbook.</p><p>The video game industry had another tough year in 2024 with thousands of worker layoffs, along with game cancellations and studio closures. A number of companies whose executives are speaking positively about AI--including Microsoft, EA, Amazon, and PlayStation--have all cut jobs in the past year. Whether or not these cuts were at all related to AI is unknown, however.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 Zombies - Citadelle des Morts Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The new gameplay trailer shows off some of the interior and exterior parts of the castle setting, with the cast of characters fighting off hordes with elemental swords, the new Tesla Storm field upgrade, and making use of the map's special traps. One trap looks like it's dumping hot oil or acid on the undead.</p><p dir="ltr">The gameplay also shows the terrifying new Doppelghast enemy. Just like Liberty Falls and Terminus have their own unique elite Zombie type, Citadelle des Morts features the Doppelghast, which has multiple heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms. This enemy looks like it can run pretty fast, and it looks very creepy doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include the Vulture Aid Perk-a-Cola, the Tesla Storm field upgrade, the Light Mend ammo mod, and 18 more Augments to unlock.</p><p>For more on Zombies, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">first trailer can be seen here</a>. The cinematics also set up a narrative that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/past-call-of-duty-zombies-storylines-will-collide-in-black-ops-6-dlc/1100-6528073/">merge storylines from Treyarch's previously unconnected Zombies storylines</a>.</p>
