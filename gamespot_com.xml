                <p>We've probably all experienced a heated rivalry with a friend or another player in a game that transitions to a full-on grudge.

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is keeping busy. In addition to a fantasy new IP, the studio is developing Project 007, which is the working title for its new James Bond game.</p><p>Announced in November 2020, Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond. We haven't seen any footage yet, but we've still learned a fair amount about the upcoming game.

Announcing games early in development for the purpose of attracting talent is a comment practice in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the big new hires for Project 007 is Rodrigo Santoro, a former Ubisoft veteran who joined IO in 2024 to become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">missions director for the James Bond game.</a> Santoro said he was happy to join IO to work on the James Bond game, saying most companies are making sequels, so he's excited for a new challenge.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</h2><p dir="ltr">Preorders for Project 007 are not available yet, but whenever that happens, we'll report back with a preorder guide.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</h2><p>So far, the only video for Project 007 was the announcement sizzle clip that was released when the game was announced in 2020.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, it's assumed the game will also come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. IO said the game is being developed for "modern systems and platforms."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Project 007 teaser video doesn't show Bond himself, so it's unclear if the character's likeness will be based on any of the actors who have played him over the years.</p><p>What is confirmed is that Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond--the first time ever for any form of James Bond entertainment--and it will be a "wholly original Bond story." Players will "earn their 00 status" in the course of the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that's all we know so far about the plot. James Bond movies are known to be globe-trotting affairs, as Bond hunts down villains across the world. The series is also known for its action, and it's expected Project 007 will include some of this. Bond also sometimes needs to be stealthy, and IO's experience with the Hitman series would seemingly help in this department.</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</h2><p dir="ltr">Project 007 is being developed using IO's proprietary Glacier engine. The company is <a href="https://ioi.dk/careers?panel=job%3Fid%3D5776172" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring a multiplayer programmer</a>, and a previously spotted job ad called for someone with multiplayer experience to work on Project 007. This suggests, but doesn't confirm, that the new James Bond game will have multiplayer.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</h2><p>Project 007 is in "active development" at IO's offices in Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>"Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities," Abrak said. "Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio."</p><p>Former MGM boss Robert Marick, meanwhile, said, "We plan to bring a new take on this legendary franchise to gamers and Bond fans around the world. IO Interactive are masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling." Marick left MGM after the game was announced.</p><h2 id="A_James_Bond_shakeup"><b>A James Bond shakeup</b></h2><p>A major unanswered question about Project 007 is whether or not anything about the project changed due to James Bond stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson getting bought out of their ownership, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">Amazon MGM Studios taking over all creative decisions.</a></p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy. Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</p><h2 id="History_of_James_Bond_games"><strong>History of James Bond games</strong></h2><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><h2 id="The_next_James_Bond_movie"><strong>The next James Bond movie</strong></h2><p>The 26th Bond movie is now in the works, with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond-producers-amy-pascal-david-heyman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on as producers. </a> Amazon MGM Studios will produce the film, but there is no word yet on any of the key details about it, including the biggest question of all: who will play James Bond? Aaron Taylor-Johnson was said to be the front-runner at some point. Also unknown is who may direct the new Bond movie or when it could release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal report from December 2024</a> said Broccoli and Wilson were sparring with Amazon executives over the future of the series, causing important developments on the project to be delayed. Now that Broccoli and Wilson are out, some are theorizing that Amazon might try to get the ball rolling quickly for Bond 26.</p>

                <p>EA's Star Wars Battlefront II is experiencing a surge in players, potentially fueled by the recent May the 4th Star Wars holiday and the Star Wars TV series Andor. The resurgence in popularity for the 2017 game has prompted some fans--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">and celebrities</a>--to petition EA to make a third game. But it probably won't happen.</p><p>That's the opinion of former DICE live producer Mats Holm. He <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), "I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally." However, Holm said he believes there are people "who are talking about it." In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksxy9m/comment/mtp7jn9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Holm said it would be challenging to bring back the team that made Battlefront II. "We are spread far and wide," he said of himself and others who have since left DICE.</p><p>No new Battlefront games have been announced, which may sound surprising considering the 2015 game and the 2017 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell 33 million copies</a>. A report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">EA rejected a pitch for a third game due in part to licensing costs.</a></p><p>Holm--who now works at Paradox--went on to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ks4y8c/comment/mtmzvd9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pitch his own idea for the future of Battlefront games</a>, saying EA should remaster Battlefront II for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles in 2027-2028. After that, and if it's a success, the developers could focus on Battlefront 3, he said.</p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p><p>While Battlefront 3 may not be in the works, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">a number of upcoming Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Catalysts are the base power of the spell, with Blizzard describing it as the "foundation." There are six Catalysts to choose from, like Disintegrate and Propulsion, that will give the spell its form and function.</p><p dir="ltr">Next are Infusions, which imbue the spell with its elemental damage type and some special effects. Lastly, players can equip three Arcana, which are used to modify the spell in a variety of ways, from granting players Unstoppable after using their Horadric spell to gaining Stealth for several seconds after use. Some Legendary Arcana grant fairly powerful effects, like the Floaty Bobble Arcana, which adds a Blink component to the spell, or the Bloody Charm, which simply executes non-boss enemies with 10% life or less when the spell is activated.</p><p dir="ltr">The Horadric Spellcraft system isn't entirely different from how seasonal powers have worked in previous seasons (a common complaint among the playerbase), but does seem to give players more flexibility than before in terms of both what powers and what damage types they want to use.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Horadric Spellcrafting will just be one component of Season 9. Blizzard, in its quest, to continue improving base elements of Diablo 4's endgame (as detailed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4's 2025 roadmap</a>) is also putting a heavy emphasis on Nightmare dungeons, with new positive affixes that will benefit players in the form of more specialized crafting rewards or specific types of gear. Players will also (finally) be able to jump into a new Nightmare dungeon while still inside a different one, rather than having to leave the dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">New for the season will be Horadric Strongrooms and Escalating Nightmares. Strongrooms are mini-dungeons inside Nightmare dungeons where players will use a wayfinder to find a hidden Horadric vault. Players will need to battle through demons in a set amount of time in order to claim the Strongroom's rewards, and the difficulty of the Strongroom, and its rewards, can be adjusted and increased by activating various modifiers similar to players add modifiers in the Infernal Hordes activity. Additionally, players earn Horadric Jewels to put in their gear to further modify their Horadric spell.</p><p dir="ltr">Escalating Nightmares is a new spin on Nightmare dungeons that sees the effects of three different Nightmare dungeons stack in succession. Players will need to earn Escalation Sigils from Horadric Storerooms to challenge the Escalating Nightmares. Those who survive all three dungeons in succession will then battle against a new boss encounter with Astaroth, who players may remember from Diablo 4's base campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 will be playable on the game's PTR from May 27 to June 3, as Blizzard looks to test the season's new systems as well as various balance changes and new Unique items. According to Diablo 4's in-game timers, Season 9 proper will begin July 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Diablo 4 Season 8, Belial's Return, is in full swing, having revamped the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-patch-notes-introduce-endgame-boss-overhaul/1100-6531150/" data-ref-id="1100-6531150">endgame boss cycle</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">battle pass</a> (the latter of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">hasn't exactly gone over well</a>).

                <p>After Bungie was hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">plagiarism allegations for its Marathon revamp</a>, more information has been revealed about other problems within the company. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/" data-ref-id="1100-6531737">Aside from a toxic work environment</a> coming from the top of Bungie, company heads were pitching to give <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a> a subscription service on top of already paying for a PlayStation Plus membership.</p><p>Former Bungie employees spoke with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly belittle staff.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," said a former Destiny 2 developer, which was the focus point for many former employees. When higher-ups pitched a subscription model for Destiny 2, it was only allegedly shut down due to the staff's "vehement" opposition. That would mean players would pay for a sub on top of other necessary subs like PS Plus, depending on your platform. Bungie's leadership followed that up by reportedly holding a meeting where the staff were given a "monetization scolding" for not enabling enough microtransactions.</p><p>Bungie has made numerous changes to Destiny 2's monetization since its launch nearly eight years ago, including a shift to a free-to-play model. The company has had to increase the relevance of the Eververse store and seasonal content passes, both of which include paid cosmetics.</p><p>In late 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">Bungie reduced its workforce by over 300 roles</a>, after a drastic fall in revenue. This put even more pressure on different methods of monetizing its games.</p><p>Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">were part of these layoffs</a> and general sentiment around Marathon has not been the best, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/">its developers are asking fans to give the game a chance</a>, despite the surrounding controversy.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a>.</p>
