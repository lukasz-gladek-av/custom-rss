                <p>Several games offer the chance to explore real-world locations, but the upcoming Pigeon: A Love Story will make you realize just how big a city can really be. Revealed during the Six One Indie showcase, Pigeon: A Love Story does exactly what it says on the box: You're a pigeon, and you're looking for your life-partner inside of a densely populated metropolitan area like Paris, London, or New York.</p><p>Not only is each "global pigeon hub" rendered completely to scale, but they're also populated with an "accurate number of pigeons" as well, developer Alex Taylor added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpi745LhaT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wpi745LhaT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Described as a slow game for fast times, Pigeon: A Love Story will allow players to explore every building, every street, and every pigeon in a real-time, city-wide simulation. Hundreds of thousands of autonomous pigeon NPCs are flying around, and if the task of finding a feathery soulmate sounds almost impossible, you can team up with a friend to collaborate, compete, or try to find one another.</p><p>There's even a zen aspect to the romantic adventure, as you can choose to let the game play itself--screensaver-style--and enjoy some digital birdwatching. There's even a chill soundtrack to add some lo-fi vibes to the experience.</p><p>While this isn't the first game to focus on pigeons--remember Hatoful Boyfriend--it is an ambitious title aiming to simulate the romantic pursuits of these birds. A release date hasn't been set yet, but it will launch for PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>Late last year, players noted that images of Tencent's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/" data-ref-id="5000-652952">Light of Motiram</a>, had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">a very striking resemblance</a> to Sony's Horizon games. Sony noticed as well and subsequently filed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493"> a lawsuit against Tencent</a>. Now, Tencent is arguing that Sony's lawsuit has no merit and that the case against it should be dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-monopoly-genre-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, Tencent's motion to dismiss accuses Sony of attempting to "fence off a well-trodden corner of popular culture and declare it Sony's exclusive domain." Tencent's position is that Sony's claim that Horizon Zero Dawn is "like no fictional world created before [or] since" is contradicted by the game's developers and represents an "impermissible monopoly on genre conventions."</p><p>Tencent notes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> art director Jan-Bart Van Beek acknowledged the game's similarity to an earlier title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/enslaved-odyssey-to-the-west/" data-ref-id="5000-56869">Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</a>, in a behind-the-scenes documentary. According to Tencent, Sony originally shelved Horizon over those similarities before ultimately producing the game.</p><p>Sony's original complaint cited a March 2024 meeting between the company and Tencent about a potential Horizon spin-off mobile game that was ultimately rejected by Sony. Tencent's motion to dismiss acknowledges that a meeting took place, but states, "no Tencent Holdings executives or employees were at this meeting," and adds that "Sony has failed to make a prima facie showing that any actions at this meeting caused harm to Sony."</p><p>The motion goes on to state that Tencent Holdings, Tencent America, and Proxima Beta U.S. should be dismissed from the lawsuit because Sony "cannot [specifically] substantiate the claims it brings against [them]." Light of Motiram is being developed by two Tencent-affliliated companies, Polaris Quest / Aurora Studios and Proxima Beta PTE Ltd., a subsidy based in Singapore.</p><p>Tencent also states that since Light of Motiram hasn't been released, "the alleged infringements have not occurred and may in fact never occur."</p><p>Shortly after Sony filed the lawsuit, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-accused-of-copying-horizon-gets-radically-updated-steam-page/1100-6533796/" data-ref-id="1100-6533796">Tencent changed several elements</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a>, and the Horizon-like imagery was removed. Light of Motiram is expected to be released in 2027.</p>
