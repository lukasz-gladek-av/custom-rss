                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, or whatever Nintendo calls its next console, is expected to be announced soon and released later this year. But how many units will the system sell? According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lfakfksucs2q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>, the Switch 2 will sell 4.3 million units in the US during 2025.</p><p>This assumes that the Switch 2 launches in the first half of 2025, Piscatella clarified. He added that the Switch should make up about one third of all video game consoles sold during 2025 in the US, excluding PC portable devices.</p><p>Piscatella went on to say that he expects the Switch 2 to face "hardware constraints" for several months after launch, and that the total number of units sold will depend on how many Nintendo can produce. Despite the popularity of a new Nintendo console, Piscatella said he continues to expect Sony's PlayStation 5 to be the No. 1 best-selling console in the US in 2025 based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo's platforms are popular globally, and US sales represent just one piece of the console's expected overall sales. Circana tracks the US video game industry specifically. </p><p>The Switch 2 has big shoes to fill, as the existing which has sold <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 145 million systems and more than 1.3 billion games to date.</a></p><p>Nintendo has said it will officially announce the new console by the end of March 2025, and while we wait for that, the rumor floodgates have opened. Plenty of unverified images and details about the system, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">purported new Joy-Cons</a>, have emerged in recent days and weeks. Another recent rumor said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-month-and-more-accessories-apparently-revealed/1100-6528689/" data-ref-id="1100-6528689">Switch 2 will launch this April.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 could be one of gaming's biggest stories in 2025, alongside the expected launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in Fall 2025.</p>

It has an 8-inch 1920 x 1200 LCD display with 120Hz variable refresh rate. Other features include adjustable RGB light rings around the analog sticks, two back buttons, one trackpad, and a pair of levers on the back that modify trigger tension.</p><p>Unlike the original Legion Go, this one doesn’t offer detachable gamepads or a kickstand, opting instead for a solid, streamlined design built specifically for handheld play. Lenovo increased the battery capacity from 49.2Wh to 55Wh with the Legion Go S.</p><p>Lenovo will also launch a second Windows configuration in May for $600. This lower-priced model has 16GB RAM instead of 32GB. Preorders aren't live for the $600 model just yet.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17363582036264?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value">Lenovo Legion Go S (SteamOS Version)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/howl.link\/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/17363582036264?u1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://howl.link/ux959hpwvz03t?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17363582036264?u1=subid_value">$500 | Releases in May</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The SteamOS edition isn't available to preorder yet, but it'll launch in May for $500. The Legion Go S will be the first third-party handheld that uses Valve's Steam Deck operating system. This model will receive the same updates as Valve’s Steam Deck. That means you won’t have to worry about Valve abandoning SteamOS on the Legion Go S, as the team is treating SteamOS as a unified platform regardless of which handheld you’re playing on.</p><p>While it retains the Ryzen Z2 Go chip and the 8-inch 1200p display, the SteamOS edition is limited to 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You can upgrade your SSD or expand the storage capacity via microSD.</p><p>For comparison, the Steam Deck starts at $399 for the 256GB model with a 7-inch LCD display. The 512GB model with a 7.4-inch OLED display costs $549, and the 1TB OLED edition goes for $649.</p><p>If you opt for the Legion Go S, you'll get a faster processor and a larger 8-inch screen with higher resolution--1200p compared to the Steam Deck's 800p resolution. That said, the Legion Go S uses an LCD panel, whereas the 512GB and 1TB Steam Deck models have better OLED screens.</p><p>Lenovo went with a more conventional control layout with offset sticks, while the Steam Deck's two sticks, D-pad, and face buttons are essentially aligned. The layout admittedly looks odd, but the Steam Deck is a lot comfier than it looks. Valve's handheld has four remappable back triggers, while Lenovo's new handheld only has two. The Steam Deck also has two large trackpads, whereas the Legion Go S has one small pad. Adjustable trigger tension is unique to the Legion Go S.</p><p>With these differences, it'll be interesting to see how the Legion Go S stacks up against the Steam Deck. Expect to learn more about the handheld as we get closer to its May release date. We'll update this article when preorders are available.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>The Legion Go S isn’t the only upcoming handheld from Lenovo, as the brand is also working on a Legion Go 2. It’ll arrive sometime this year (an exact date is yet to be announced) and features a more powerful Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, an 8.8-inch, 144Hz OLED display with VRR, and a 74Wh battery.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon-while-you-can/1100-6528683/">Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-physical-edition-gets-ps5-reprint-snag-it-while-you-can/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-iphone-and-android-controller-is-50-off/1100-6524903/">Backbone One iPhone And Android Controller Is 50% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-war-of-the-rohirrim-4k-blu-ray-limited-edition-steelbook-preorders/1100-6528224/">The Lord Of The Rings: The War Of The Rohirrim 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazios-massive-official-strategy-guide-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6528507/">Metaphor: ReFantazio Is Getting A Nearly 600-Page Official Strategy Guide</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Call of Duty's big Squid Game crossover event is in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-warzone-squid-game-event-bundles-announcement#VIPs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full swing</a>, and the newest DLC has landed in the store. Players can now buy the VIPs bundle, which allows players to don special masks inspired by the TV show.</p><p>The VIPs Tracer Pack, as it's called, includes two Operators--the Panther Mask VIP and the Lion Mask VIP. The bundle also includes the "Choicest" launcher, the "Lacquered" sniper rifle, and the "Satin Slayer" SMG. A new frag grenade skin, "Death Plated," is included in the bundle as well.</p><p>What's more, players get a new finishing move, "Pinky Up," as well as the "Gilded" emblem, "List Required" calling card, and "Very Important Player" loading screen. You can see this content in action in the video below. The bundle costs 2,400 COD Points, or about $20.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KTvPAodyBY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_KTvPAodyBY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty's Squid Game event also includes the Pink Guards Tracer Pack and the upcoming Young-hee Tracer Pack. These are separate from the new Squid Game Event Pass, which is a paid battle pass specifically for the Squid Game event that includes its own set of unique rewards based on the show.</p><p>The Squid Game Event Pass is the first such microtransaction offering in Call of Duty. Its release has ignited a debate among players about how far Activision will go to make money from microtransactions. Initially, Activision did not reveal the price of the Event Pass, but later did, confirming it would be 1,100 COD Points, or about $10.</p><p>In addition to the new store bundles, the Call of Duty / Squid Game event brought new modes to the game, including Red Light, Green Light and Pentathlon. As for the TV show, Squid Game Season 2 debuted on Netflix at the end of December and has become a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/squid-game-season-2-viewership-rises-second-most-popular-non-english-series-1236250247/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">smash hit in terms of viewership.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>This story includes content some readers may find disturbing.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Former employees of Brandoville Studios--an Indonesian support studio that worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> before closing its doors in August--recently stated that they were subjected to mental and physical abuse while working on the game. Now, Ubisoft has responded to their claims.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are deeply disturbed by the recent reports surrounding Brandoville Studios," an Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-deeply-disturbed-by-damning-reports-of-abuse-at-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio" rel="nofollow ">told Eurogamer</a> when asked to comment on the controversy. "We strongly condemn all forms of abuse, and our thoughts are with the affected employees."</p><p dir="ltr">The claims of abuse were first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR9HQ2C6h_4">reported by People Make Games</a> in a 50-minute YouTube video uploaded earlier this week. In the video, former Brandoville employee Christa Sydney alleges that she was subjected to various forms of abuse by Kwan Cherry Lai. Cherry Lai is the wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai and was responsible for overseeing Brandoville's daily operations while the studio was still open.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sydney, Cherry Lai created a toxic work environment, using gossip to alienate employees and manipulating employees' schedules to an extreme degree. But the alleged misconduct didn't stop there--Sydney says Cherry Lai forced her to stay awake for days at a time, only allowing her a few minutes of sleep over the four days leading up to the 2022 External Development Summit conference. Sydney also alleges that Cherry Lai forced her to engage in Christian religious practices, made her write lines as a punishment, and even demanded Sydney send over photos of her daily work outfits for approval before coming into the office.</p><p dir="ltr">"5:30 AM we need to wake up and then like, pray to god, and then [at] like 6:00 AM we need to go do our exercise, and then 8:00 AM shower," Sydney said of Cherry Lai's desire to control employees' schedules. "9:00 AM be at the office, and then even like, what time we need to drink water--she also put it in the schedule. And then what time we eat, what time we go to bed… that sort of thing."</p><p dir="ltr">But according to Sydney, that was just the tip of the iceberg, and Cherry Lai's behavior would eventually escalate to physical abuse. Sydney says she was forced to film a video in which she slapped herself in the face 100 times as a form of punishment, and also claims she was directed to slam her head into a doorframe repeatedly before being forced to apologize for "mistakes."</p><p dir="ltr">"The earliest record that I have was a recording of me hitting myself in the mouth until it bled, and then she wanted me to take a picture of the blood in my mouth," Sydney shared in the People Make Games video, which includes chat logs, photos, and recorded footage backing up her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney previously spoke out about her experiences in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">2021 interview with People Make Games</a>, and says Lai forced her to film an apology video retracting her claims.</p><p dir="ltr">Other former Brandoville employees have come forward with reports of abuse as well. Caesarion Balthazar, who also worked at Brandoville while the studio was still in operation, claims that Cherry Lai took large chunks of his paychecks, adding up to the equivalent of a month's salary. When he tried to leave the studio, he was told he owed Lai money for a series of training programs. There was a problem, however: He hadn't engaged in any of the training programs he was being charged for. Syifana Afiati, who worked at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024, claims she was overworked during her pregnancy, and refused time off when her child died shortly after birth.</p><p dir="ltr">After the studio was liquidated in 2024, Cherry and Ken Lai formed a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was hired on there as well, but later left after another incident with Cherry pushed her over the edge.</p><p dir="ltr">"She was taunting me. She was challenging me, basically," Syndey said. "I thought to myself, 'She already doesn't have anyone else [to work for her].' I was quite literally the only person left with her, and she was still doing this to me. But this time around I was like, 'You know what? I'm so tired, it's like 2:00 AM. I should order a cab home. When she realized that I wasn't going back to her, she panicked."</p><p dir="ltr">Sydney claims Cherry threatened her, but after years of abuse Sydney was at her limit. She refused to return to her position and began sharing her story, providing videos, photos, and text messages to back up her claims, which led to her story getting picked up by various news outlets and social media sites in Indonesia.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Ubisoft has denounced Cherry Lai's alleged actions, Lai herself gave a bizarre response when contacted for comment by People Make Games.</p><p dir="ltr">"To me, my part of the story is not important as long as my team are good and safe now," Cherry Lai said of the accusations. She refused to provide further comment.</p><p>Employees interviewed by People Make Games say that although CEO Ken Lai was not directly abusive toward them, he enabled his wife's conduct. At the time of writing, Ken Lai has not made any statements regarding the alleged abuse his wife engaged in. Brandoville Studios employees also worked on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/age-of-empires-iv/">Age Of Empires IV</a> during the timeframe the abuse allegedly took place, but Microsoft has not yet commented on the People Make Games video, nor has it addressed the allegations of abuse by Cherry Lai.</p>

After the events of Arcane Season 2, Mel returns to Noxus, and her new in-game appearance shows her embracing her Noxian heritage. Riot says the development team and those working on Arcane came together to define Mel's new look and how it should be portrayed both in-game and in the show, with "game inspiring show and vice versa."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z76xgEYgjt0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z76xgEYgjt0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But Mel's big entrance is more than just looks. While Riot has not yet revealed her full ability kit, she will have a unique type of ability never before seen in the MOBA--projectile reflection. She'll be able to bounce back projectiles at enemies with a well-timed button press.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-league-of-legends-cinematic-from-arcane-studio-continues-shows-story/1100-6528678/" data-ref-id="1100-6528678">cinematic for League of Legends' first season of 2025 was made in collaboration with Arcane animation studio Fortiche</a>, and serves as a continuation of certain Arcane storylines. Mel is shown returning to Noxus, while the leaders of the mysterious Black Rose discuss the events of the show and what their next plans will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Riot is adopting a new approach for League of Legends seasons going forward, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-introduces-new-seasonal-model-with-welcome-to-noxus/1100-6528085/" data-ref-id="1100-6528085">strong seasonal themes</a> that will tie into both the game's story and its gameplay.
