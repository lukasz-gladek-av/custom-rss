                <p>Upcoming action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/" data-ref-id="5000-654976">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</a> may be free-to-play when it launches on mobile devices, but those who want to play on Steam as soon as possible will have to pay.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Netmarble <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3183280/view/536597286667419654?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> the game, which tells an original story within the universe of the popular HBO show, will release in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> on March 26. Whereas most games that release in early access could potentially be there for months or years, Netmarble says in the game's FAQ it expects Game of Thrones: Kingsroad to be in early access for a "minimum of four weeks," after which it will be free-to-play.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC-eVMvcRBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hC-eVMvcRBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the early access period not all of the game will be available, though players will be able to explore the Northern regions of Westeros, encounter characters like Jon Snow, visit several major cities, complete various side quests, participate in co-op dungeons, and complete 50 chapters of the main storyline. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's full free-to-play launch will include more regions to explore, additional co-op dungeons, and more. Netmarble states more regions and challenges will be added post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain early access, players will need to purchase a Founder's Pack. The cheapest one is $25 and comes with a cosmetic "Northern" outfit, a Jon Snow emoji pack, and 350 of the game's Iron Mark currency. A $50 Founder's Pack nets owners the same plus the game's premium battle pass, additional outfits, horse mounts, a founder's title, and more currencies. A $90 version comes with all of the above plus a Direwolf mount, mount equipment, an upgraded premium battle pass, and even more currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120"></a><figcaption>A breakdown of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's various Founder's Packs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once Game of Thrones: Kingsroad comes out of Steam early access and additionally launches on mobile, it will feature full cross-play and cross-progression across platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will put players in the shoes of a customizable heir of a minor Northern lord who must navigate the dangerous politics of Westeros in order to restore their house's standing. It offers three different classes (Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin) to choose from, with combat that requires careful dodging and parrying to counter enemy attacks. Players can team up to fight "beasts of myth and legend" in the game's co-op dungeon mode, which will be required in order to earn components needed to make the game's best-quality gear.</p><p dir="ltr">While Netmarble's Game of Thrones title isn't the first third-person action-RPG set in Westeros (that honor goes to Cyanide Studios' 2012 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/game-of-thrones/" data-ref-id="5000-113588">Game of Thrones</a>), it almost certainly won't be the last. In a statement announcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shutdown of Monolith and two other studios last month</a>, Warner Bros. Games said it would look to focus on four popular IP for future projects, one of them being Game of Thrones.</p>

It is a solid choice for streamers thanks to its native Discord, OBS Studio, and XSplit support without the need for additional drivers. It also benefits from stream- and game-responsive lighting, which can add a pop of color to your broadcasts, and it syncs with Razer Synapse so you can quickly personalize all its settings.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute\/dp\/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Seiren V3 Mini Microphone</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute\/dp\/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Mini-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT787NLW?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Black: $42.90 | Pink: $49 | White: $50 (Normally $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>If you're looking for something smaller and simpler--and even more affordable--the Seiren V3 Mini is also on sale right now.

                <p dir="ltr">Disco Elysium is coming to mobile devices for the first time later this year, and we got exclusive hands (and thumbs) on with the new version of the RPG. This isn't a simple port whatsoever. In fact, GameSpot's Lucy James admits that "it is very different to what I thought it was going to be."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHcM71FPjPH/?igsh=MW1ib3hlNnE1Znd0bw%3D%3D" rel="nofollow ">On Instagram</a>, James shows off Disco Elysium running on Android and how the RPG is making the transition to smartphones. The game originally launched on PC in 2019 before coming to other consoles in the years that followed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-releases-on-nintendo-switch-october-12/1100-6496489/">such as Nintendo Switch in 2021</a>. But with this new port, how you engage with Disco Elysium is different. "It's meant to be played in these shorter bursts, rather than sitting down and really committing to a very dense RPG," said James.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the controls, Disco Elysium is embracing how people use their smartphones. "The way you interact with it is how you interact with your phone," James said. Basically, you're swiping and tapping with your thumb while your smartphone stays in portrait mode. So it looks possible to play through the experience with one hand.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, developer ZA/UM Studio announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">the mobile edition of Disco Elysium for launch this summer</a>. The studio has faced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ousted-disco-elysium-devs-claim-fraud-studio-says-they-were-fired-over-misconduct/1100-6509090/">a very public breakup with the RPG's director and art director</a>, who claim they were forced out of the company by investors. However, ZA/UM is forging ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/">a new espionage RPG called Project C4</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disco-elysium-the-final-cut-review-pure-dynamite/1900-6417354/">Disco Elysium review</a>, which received a rare 10/10 score.</p>
