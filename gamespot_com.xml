                <p>Few video game developers have had to deal with the things that GSC Game World had to face while making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. The Ukrainian game developer behind this first-person shooter survival-horror title was derailed by Russia's invasion of its country in 2022. But the game was finally released earlier this month with some noticeable issues. Fortunately, a day-one patch has reportedly dealt with some of those problems, while others remain.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-tech-review-pc-xbox-series-x-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer and Digital Foundry</a>, the patch arrived after reviewers had already played through Stalker 2. The good news is that this patch seems to have significantly helped the game's frame-rate performance. But the site notes that "the game still suffers from everything to minor, amusing bugs to more serious issues and heavy CPU utilization." On Xbox Series X, the game is said to occasionally freeze entirely for a few seconds when visiting large towns, before continuing with an erratic rate of frames per second.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHQ3jAeza60" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cHQ3jAeza60" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Overall, the first impression left by Stalker 2 remains positive. GameSpot's Richard Wakeling wrote in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">Stalker 2 review</a> notes that it "boldly sticks to the studio's vision of a seamless open-world survival shooter, which the series has always strived to be. It's rough around the edges and uncompromising in a way that is sometimes off-putting. Yet the series' emergent gameplay remains intact and is further complemented by a fascinating setting and the most accomplished combat in the series so far." However, Wakeling also reiterated many of the technical issues stated above, as well as crashes and other bugs that hampered the experience.</p><p>Xbox released the behind-the-scenes documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> last month, which chronicles the ordeal that GSC Game World's team went through in order to complete the game during war time. Ultimately, many of the developers had to leave Ukraine to finish the development while others remained behind to fight for their country. That war continues to this day with no resolution in sight.</p>

                <p>When Conan O'Brien was still hosting a talk show on TBS, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/conan-obrien-is-bringing-back-clueless-gamer/1100-6509127/" data-ref-id="1100-6509127">Clueless Gamer</a> was a regular feature. While O'Brien hasn't made many episodes since the end of Conan, Clueless Gamer returned this week with a new installment that tackles the director's cut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding</a>, a game that actually features O'Brien in a cameo role.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcw16EQObXM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xcw16EQObXM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Aaron Bleyaert reunited with O'Brien for the segment, and he proceeded to explain the lore of Hideo Kojima's game at length. When O'Brien wasn't looking at the camera and silently pleading for mercy, he was pretending to be falling asleep.</p><p>O'Brien eventually got his hands on the controller and stepped into the role of Sam Porter Bridges (Norman Reedus), before promptly made a mockery of Sam's attempt to dispose of his mother's body. The scene in the game wasn't meant to be comical, but O'Brien kept finding ways to bring out the slapstick by slipping and falling before he handed over the controller to Bleyaert.</p><p>As related by O'Brien, he traveled to Japan and allowed himself to be scanned for his cameo role in the game. Kojima even briefly reappears in this video to tell O'Brien where he can find his character, who can provide players with a Sea Otter Suit for swimming. But after finding himself, O'Brien said, "Oh my God, I hate him and he's me."</p><p>To close out the segment, O'Brien jokingly pitched Kojima with the idea of making him a more heroic character in a new game, and the director invited him to return to Japan to be scanned by even more advanced technology than he was before.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-is-now-on-xbox-series-x-s-five-years-after-it-first-launched-on-ps4/1100-6527622/" data-ref-id="1100-6527622">Death Stranding Directors' Cut made its debut on Xbox Series X|S</a> after previously being a console exclusive for PS5 and PS4.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> COD Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 - Season 01 Battle Pass Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The update refreshes Black Ops 6's multiplayer to bring back the popular 10v10 moshpit playlists for both core and Hardcore. Hideout, Extraction, and Protocol are now added to the map pool for 10v10 as well.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Zombies side of the update, the patch notes reveal the developer has fixed an issue that previously caused players to be slowed when reloading while sprinting. It also addresses an issue that could cause the "Box Addict" Dark Ops challenge to not track properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Rebirth Island returns to Warzone, again. The map previously arrived the week after Season 1's launch, but was removed just hours after launch due to "map-specific issues." The patch notes confirm that the map is now available with lighting and audio adjustments that have been made to improve gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer thanked players for their patience, and discussed the map's disappearance by saying, "We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience."</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes XP balancing across various Warzone modes. This includes increased player XP in standard battle royale and Plunder mode, while increased weapon XP is adjusted for Plunder and Resurgence modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major change is a buff to the popular Stim Shot tactical equipment. The patch notes reveal the Stim Shot's speed boost duration has been increased from one to three seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, an update went live to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/">add the Legacy XP tokens back into Black Ops 6</a>. It was also revealed by Activision that players who buy Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/buying-black-ops-6-or-playing-with-game-pass-comes-with-a-nice-bonus-for-warzone/1100-6527891/">receive a 30% XP boost in Warzone</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>New Event: The Hit List</h4><p>Who’s next?

We wanted to take the necessary time to address key issues and make improvements to ensure the best possible experience.</p><h2>MAPS</h2><ul><li><b>Rebirth Island </b><ul><li>A number of lighting and audio adjustments have been made to improve gameplay.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>GENERAL</h2><ul><li><b>Armory </b><ul><li>The Warzone Armory will be re-enabled later today.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>XP Balancing </b><ul><li>Increased player XP in Battle Royale and Plunder</li><li>Increased Weapon XP in Plunder and Resurgence</li></ul></li></ul><p>We’ve made several adjustments to Player and Weapon XP in order to bring earn rates across different modes closer together.</p><ul><li><b>Stim Shot </b><ul><li>The speed boost duration has been increased from 1 second to 3.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Upon the launch of Warzone, we identified a critical issue and, in response, temporarily reduced both the speed increase and the duration of Stim Shots while we worked on a solution. Our goal is to offer a meaningful speed boost with a clear upper limit, to ensure balanced and consistent combat encounters. As it stands, both Resolute and Stim Shot provide a 15% speed boost each, with their combined effect capping at 20%. This allows players to experiment with various combinations to reach the maximum impact.</p><ul><li><b>Deployable Box Interaction Speed </b><ul><li>We’ve removed an unintentional delay that previously prevented players from interacting with the Armor/Munitions/Utility Box when initially deployed.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>BUG FIXES</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue on Area 99 that would cause players to hear Killstreaks from across the map.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would cause players to drop a weapon involuntarily while attempting to pick up a different weapon from the ground.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that would prompt players to remove an Aftermarket Part from their weapon despite one not being currently equipped.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused the STB 556 Assault Rifle body to disappear when equipping an underbarrel attachment.</li></ul>
