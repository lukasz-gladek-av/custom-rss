                <p>Cyberpunk 2077's next big update, 2.3, is not going to launch on time. Developer CD Projekt Red has announced that the studio needs "some more time to make sure we're happy with it." It was previously set to launch on June 26 but has been delayed indefinitely.</p><p>The developer also teased that update 2.3 is aiming to have a scope around the same as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-what-cyberpunk-2077s-unexpected-2-2-update-is-bringing/2900-6052/" data-ref-id="2900-6052">2.2 update</a>. That's saying something, as the 2.2 update--released in December 2024--was a huge one. "We appreciate your patience!" the developer said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1937135894978253112" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Hey chooms,<br>We initially hoped to put Update 2.3 in your hands on June 26.

                <p>One of the big draws for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> was its cast of voice actors, as the turn-based RPG featured the talents of Charlie Cox, Ben Starr, Jennifer English, and Andy Serkis. For Cox, the critical success of the game has not gone unnoticed by him, as he remarked that he'd only heard good things about it. Jokingly, the Daredevil actor said that he felt like a "total fraud" for having only been in a studio for several hours to record his lines as Gustave, who quickly became a fan-favorite character with players.</p><p>"I don't mean to minimize it in any way, and apparently, the game is awesome. I'm not a gamer, I haven't played it," Cox said at Washington State Summer Con (via <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1937090360645390366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Culture Crave</a>). "My agent asked me if I wanted to go and do a voiceover--I was in the studio for 4 hours. People keep saying 'congratulations' and I feel like a total fraud. But I'm so thrilled for the company, I'm so thrilled it did really well."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>While Cox's work for Expedition 33 was done in a day, his character still had a massive impact on the game, especially in its early hours and at the end of its first act. The performances of Cox and the rest of the cast have been widely hailed for their nuanced and emotional performances, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-is-no-longer-the-best-rated-game-of-2025/1100-6532565/">which helped make Expedition 33 the best-reviewed game for several months</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-exploring-more-localization-options-new-content/1100-6532452/">Developer Sandfall Interactive has also been talking about what's next for Expedition 33</a>. The studio is looking at adding "a wide range of future improvements" including expanded localization and accessibility features. Sandfall is also preparing to start working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/">on its next game</a>, and while it is ready to say what exactly its next title might be, the studio did mention that it has some "great ideas" to work with on it.</p>

                <p>The Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and his fellow CDPR veterans at Rebel Wolves have shared an extended gameplay demo from the studio's first game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker/" data-ref-id="5000-647970">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. As revealed earlier this year, Dawnwalker's protagonist is Coen, a young man in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-reveals-a-medieval-world-ruled-by-vampires/1100-6528789/" data-ref-id="1100-6528789">a medieval European country that has been taken over by vampires</a>. But as seen in the video below, Coen has different ways of opposing the new regime, both as a vampire and as a human.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro8psdfcxJE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ro8psdfcxJE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to design director Daniel Sadowski, the side mission showcased in this demo takes place near the middle of the game. Coen only has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">30 days and 30 nights</a> to save his family, and Sadowski notes that he could storm the vampire's castle and rescue them at any time. But without allies or enough power to stand against the game's most powerful vampires, that attempt probably wouldn't end well for Coen.</p><p>Coen isn't helpless during the day, as the demo shows he can draw upon some magic when fighting his foes. But none of his vampire abilities can be used while the sun is up. This allows for some advantages, as he can walk through the front door of the cathedral uncontested and ask questions inside. But waiting until nightfall gives Coen the ability to climb the walls and sneak inside just as an elder vampire, Xanthe, is conducting some kind of ritual.</p><p>Sadowski added that there's not much difference between the side quests and the main story, as players are given the chance to shape their own narratives within the 30 day timeframe. He also added that it may be possible to reason with Xanthe or even to defeat her. But she proves to be more than Coen can handle on this playthrough.</p><p>Bandai Namco will release The Blood of Dawnwalker on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p>
