                <p>If you're considering getting into VR gaming, the Meta Quest 3 and 3S are ideal starting points, thanks to their affordability and user-friendly all-in-one setups compared to other high-end VR headsets. For those who've recently purchased one of Meta's flagship VR devices (which also happen to be on sale right now), you can pick up several helpful Meta Quest 3 and 3S accessories at a discount thanks to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon's Prime Big Deal Day</a>s event. The price cuts include upgraded headwear like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest Elite Strap</a> for $56 (was $70), and helpful components like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Quest Link Cable</a> for $64 (was $80), which lets you connect the normally standalone headsets to your gaming PC. There are a few other Meta Quest VR accessories included in Amazon's sale, and we've rounded them all up in the list below.</p><div title="6535252 - Meta Quest 3S accessories and headsets Prime Big Deal Days Oct. 2025" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4612" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535252 - Meta Quest 3S accessories and headsets Prime Big Deal Days Oct. 2025" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Meta Quest Elite Strap</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CD15C641?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$56 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Let's be honest, the default Meta Quest head strap just isn't very comfortable. <span><em>Especially </em>if</span> you're going to be in VR land for longer sessions. That's why we recommend grabbing one of Meta's upgradable straps while they're on sale for Prime Big Deal Days. The base version of the Meta Quest Elite strap is just $56 during the sale (that's about $15 off the usual price), and brings enhanced, adjustable comfort to your headset thanks to its nifty dial that'll help you get a precise fit. It'll take some of the pressure off of your face, and comes with a silicone backing that cradles the back of your head. Just be aware that if you have a carrying case for your Meta Quest 3 or 3S, the headset won't fit inside while the Elite Strap is attached.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Meta Quest Elite Strap (with Battery)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CPYMDPB5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$104 (was $130)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The upgraded version of the Meta Quest Elite Strap comes with a built-in battery pack that'll get you up to two hours of extra play time, which is probably worth it if you're planning on having multi-hour-long VR sessions (just beware of motion sickness).

The breathable design allows for better ventilation during use, and the flexible frame will let you get a more snug and supportive fit so you can play much longer.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">Meta Quest Link Cable</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081SHD773?tag=gamespot-primeday-20">$64 (was $80)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>If you're going to be using your PC as your main VR gaming hub, you'll need a long and sturdy cable to help keep your head in the game (literally).

                <p>Microsoft recently announced a major Xbox Game Pass price hike, but it's not going into effect right away in the US or abroad. Back when the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138"> 50% price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was announced on October 1</a>, people got emails from Microsoft saying when the change would happen for them, and for some people in the US, the price hike <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1974245210319196227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wasn't set to go into effect until November.</a></p><p>Now, it's been confirmed that Microsoft will allow people to keep their existing membership rates in certain countries outside the US, so long as they do not cancel. If they do, the price will go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge confirmed with Microsoft</a> that the price increase only affects users in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India if they cancel and then sign up again.</p><p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," Microsoft said in an email to subscribers in those regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAEKqYgIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9wAEKqYgIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Verge members in the regions mentioned above can continue renewing at their existing price, but only "for now." This is due to "local requirements," Microsoft said. The email sent to members said they will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of a price change. Given that, people in those regions shouldn't expect to pay the higher rates for at least a couple months.</p><p>In the US, existing subscriber should expect to begin paying the higher rates on November 4, Microsoft told The Verge. New subscribers in the US, however, must pay $30/month for Ultimate right now.</p><p>Also worth noting is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">numerous retailers in the US continue to sell Game Pass Ultimate for $20</a>, so people who want to keep their membership and pay less should grab those while they still can.</p><p>Microsoft is jacking up Game Pass Ultimate prices just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release on November 14. As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">playing Call of Duty on Game Pass just got a lot more expensive. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Have you been completing your daily Wordle challenge every day since the end of 2021, when the spelling puzzler first launched? If so, you may be the perfect candidate for the new game show that NBC is piloting. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/" rel="nofollow ">Deadline</a> has reported that the show is being filmed in the United Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Savannah Guthrie, known for her role on NBC's Today show and other journalistic work, will host the show. The project comes from Jimmy Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog company, Universal Television Alternative Studio, and The New York Times. Fallon, who has said he is "addicted" to Wordle on The Tonight Show, will serve as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">This show follows The New York Times’ acquisition of the Wordle, which was originally created by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle in 2022. The daily puzzle is still hugely popular. Last year, it was played 5.3 billion times, up from 4.8 billion in 2023. Everyone plays it, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-pope-plays-wordle-and-words-with-friends-and-he-just-watched-conclave/1100-6531417/" data-ref-id="1100-6531417">Pope Leo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This news doesn't necessarily mean that a Wordle game show will eventually air on NBC or Peacock. It still has several hurdles to overcome, including approval once the show is produced, before we’ll actually be able to see it.</p><p dir="ltr">CBS already has a Wordle-like show called <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/wordle-game-show-lingo-cbs-rupaul-1235091772/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lingo</a>, hosted by RuPaul Charles. It premiered in 2024 and has been renewed for future seasons. Lingo has been around for decades, as it originally began airing in the 1980s.</p>
