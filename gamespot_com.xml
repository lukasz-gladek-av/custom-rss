Hideo Kojima has announced that Deadpool actor Shioli Kutsuna, who plays Yukio in the Marvel series, has finished her scenes for the game.</p><p>"Thank you so much for your hard work! Despite the challenges of the pandemic, she handled 3D scanning, performance capture in LA, and both English ADR and Japanese voice recording across various locations.

He also presented both Kase and Kutsuna with flowers, as you can see in the image below. While some actors have concluded their work on the game, that doesn't mean the game is done. "The game remains in development," Kojima said.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 also features Norman Reedus, Troy Baker, and Lea Seydoux coming back from the first game, with Elle Fanning joining the series.</p><p>In other news, Kojima recently said his latest project--believed to be Death Stranding 2--is now in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-his-new-game-is-now-in-crunch-time-wonders-how-much-longer-he-can-stay-creative/1100-6528760/" data-ref-id="1100-6528760">"crunch"</a> part of development ahead of its release.

                <p>Chappell Roan, like so many of us, loves video games and specifically Fortnite. In a new interview, the "Hot To Go" singer discussed her appreciation for video games and called on Epic to give her a Fortnite skin of her own someday.</p><p>Fortnite already has a "Hot To Go" emote, and Roan teased that a new emote inspired by her song "Good Luck Babe" might also come to Fortnite. But she really wants her own skin.</p><p>"That is what I am going to use this interview for," Roan said. "Please give me a skin. Please."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEhSOz0VoqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZEhSOz0VoqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Roan also revealed in the interview that she plays Fortnite on Switch ("that's how serious I take it," she said) and already bought the Ariana Grande skin. She was told during the interview about Fortnite's new first-person shooter mode, Ballistic, and joked that she's not interested because it means she wouldn't get to see her Ariana Grande skin.</p><p>Additionally, the 26-year-old said her idea of a perfect night involves video games and recreational drugs. "Well, if I want to have like a really good night I just eat an edible and play video games," she said. "But if I'm trying to have fun like, out, I'll take 'shrooms."</p><p>Roan also mentioned how she hopes Epic can create a Chappell Roan skin of her Statue of Liberty costume, with an apple bong as the back bling.</p><p>Fortnite's next big update is coming on January 31, which is when Fortnite OG Chapter 1, Season 2 goes live.

                <p>Ask any collector of Game Boy Advances games what their holy grail is, and chances are high that Ninja Five-O is on that list. A cult-classic action game released by Konami way back in 2003, physical GBA copies are typically listed for a very high price on the reseller market, but fortunately, you can save quite a bit on its upcoming digital release for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch on February 25. Over on Fanatical, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fninja-five-o&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fone-of-konamis-best-gba-games-releases-on-steam-next-month%2F1100-6528930%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can score a 25% discount on a Ninja Five-O preorder</a>, as the game is available there for just $18.74.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557"></a><figcaption>Ninja Five-O</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg"></figure><p>If you've never played it, Ninja Five-O puts you in the jika-tabi footwear of Joe Osugi, a detective who solves crime in the city of Zipangu with his analytical mind and ninja skills. Just like in the original GBA game, you'll take on the evil Mad Mask gang using your ninjutsu, and for anyone looking for a real challenge, you can put your ninja arts to the test with a Time Trial mode. Quality-of-life updates include quick-saves and the option to rewind the game at any time to help you get through some of the tougher stages.</p><p>Anyone looking to score a physical edition of Ninja Five-O can also check out Limited Run Games for a hard copy. Currently, these all appear to be sold out but it is worth bookmarking the site in case there's a resupply in the future. Standard and collector's editions were available, with the special edition featuring a particularly nice set of extras like a cool box, an original CD soundtrack, a strategy guide with behind-the-scenes content, and a holofoil sticker sheet.</p><h2>Ninja Five-O Physical Editions at Limited Run Games</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431559"></a><figcaption>Ninja Five-O collector's edition at Limited Run Games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ninja-five-o-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ps5-limited-run-109-ninja-five-o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ps5-limited-run-109-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/limited-run-564-ninja-five-o-ps4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/limited-run-564-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition-ps4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/switch-limited-run-246-ninja-five-o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/switch-limited-run-246-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li></ul><p>In case you're looking to grab a few more games for your shelf, there are some interesting titles to check out currently.
