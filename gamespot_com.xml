          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/" data-ref-id="5000-590662">Baby Steps</a>, the literal walking simulator from the minds behind games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/qwop/" data-ref-id="5000-93182">QWOP</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/getting-over-it-with-bennett-foddy/" data-ref-id="5000-473119">Getting Over It</a>, is out now, and publisher Devolver Digital is celebrating with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgjDYppxbA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relaxing "naturescape" stream</a> where the game's protagonist Nate violently falls into frame every 15 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all as weird, jarring, and hilarious as it sounds. In Baby Steps, "unemployed failson" Nate must traverse a "mountain-sized mountain" using the power of putting one foot in front of the other using the game's unique (and by the look of it, frustrating) physics-based control scheme. The stream highlights various landscapes from the game that Nate must overcome and presents them as serene, idyllic vistas.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjgjDYppxbA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xjgjDYppxbA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Every few minutes, however, the stream takes a sharp turn as Nate comes tumbling down some rocks or faceplants into the dirt, mimicking the experience more than a few Baby Steps players are having themselves. It's never not funny, in large part because it's easy to forget it's going to happen while the stream runs in the background on a second monitor, only for the peaceful sounds of nature to be suddenly interrupted by a bumbling oaf crashing through the landscape.</p><p dir="ltr">Those who pay close attention to the stream will notice there's more than just Nate occasionally bursting into view in a physics-based cacophony. Product keys for free copies of Baby Steps occasionally flash across the screen as well, rewarding those who have become entrapped by the meditative experience of waiting for a comically proportioned man-baby to flail onto the screen.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Steps isn't quite like anything else out there, as is evident by its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/well-this-esrb-description-sure-is-a-wild-ride/1100-6534659/" data-ref-id="1100-6534659">truly wild ESRB rating description</a> that includes the phrase "human/donkey hybrids with exposed male genitalia." Originally scheduled to release earlier, Devolver wisely chose to delay Baby Steps to September 23 in order to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-silksong-induced-game-delay-doesnt-hide-its-reasoning-in-new-trailer/1100-6534273/" data-ref-id="1100-6534273">avoid the debut of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, which it announced with a video of Nate comically failing to climb a statue of Silksong's heroine Hornet.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Steps is available now on PC and PlayStation 5, and is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-steps-is-steam-deck-verified-meaning-you-can-just-throw-the-whole-system-when-frustrated/1100-6534828/" data-ref-id="1100-6534828">Steam Deck verified</a>, in case you wanted the ability to throw your whole console in frustration.</p>

                <p>Activision has confirmed that you can indeed pet the dog in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, but it's not exactly what you think. Black Ops 7 is a futuristic game set in 2035, and it features the Deployable Armored Weaponized Groundcraft, or <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/DAWG" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">D.A.W.G.</a> In a newly released video, the developers from Treyarch said a small team put in the work to add the ability to pet the killer robot machine. </p><p>"This is a fun one. It started as a small, little Easter egg and, inevitably, somebody asked the question, <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/can-i-pet-that-dawg-GK5crqi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">'Can I pet that dog?'</a> And a very small group of people made it happen," design director Matt Scronce said.</p><p>You can see the character petting the D.A.W.G. in the video below, but Scronce said Treyarch is not going to reveal exactly <em>how </em>players achieve petting the D.A.W.G. You'll have to figure that out for yourself, he said.</p><p>Players will get to try to figure it out for themselves when the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">Black Ops 7 multiplayer beta</a> kicks off in early October. </p><p>Earlier this week, Activision opened the floodgates on information about Black Ops 7's multiplayer, including revealing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-all-18-maps-coming-at-launch/1100-6534905/" data-ref-id="1100-6534905">all the maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-modes/2900-7059/" data-ref-id="2900-7059">modes available at launch.</a></p><p>Activision will share lots more details on Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode during the Call of Duty: Next event, which is scheduled for September 30. </p><p>Black Ops 7 is a direct sequel to 2024's Black Ops 6, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">the year's best-selling game in the US.</a> The same two co-lead developers, Raven Software and Treyarch, made both games.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In response to the Department of Homeland Security's video using Ash Ketchum to promote ICE, The Pokemon Company's ex-legal chief said he "wouldn't touch" it, suggesting some possible reasons why the company might not pursue legal action.</p><p>This week, Homeland Security <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1970251208322621530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a video to X</a> of an arrest compilation. In between footage of ICE agents handcuffing people at their homes and in their cars are clips from the OG Pokemon TV series, with the famed "Gotta catch 'em all" theme playing in the background. When Ash Ketchum looks up at the sky, the text "The Department of Homeland Security" populates the screen in Pokemon's iconic yellow-and-blue font. As a Poke Ball closes, the camera zooms in on wrists in cuffs. And at the very end of the video, those arrested appear as Pokemon cards with their "crime" described under their picture.</p><p>Fans were understandably upset about this, with many in the comments begging for The Pokemon Company to sue the DHS. However, the company's former legal chief, Don McGowan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fans-want-pokmon-to-sue-after-department-of-homeland-security-video-uses-ash-ketchum-to-promote-ice-but-the-companys-former-legal-boss-says-he-wouldnt-touch-this" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained to IGN</a> why The Pokemon Company likely won't do anything about the video.</p><p>"I don't see them doing anything about this for a few reasons," McGowan started. "First, think of how little you see [The Pokémon Company International]'s name in the press. They are insanely publicity-shy and prefer to let the brand be the brand. Second, many of their execs in the USA are on green cards. Even if I was still at the company I wouldn't touch this, and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met. This will blow over in a couple of days and they'll be happy to let it."</p><p>It's unclear what The Pokemon Company proper will do or say in response to the DHS's co-opting of Pokemon and Ash Ketchum. The video is still up and has been reposted by the government body's official account, so it appears as though DHS is happy to continue using Ash and the "Gotta catch 'em all" theme as ICE promotional material.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-wow-legion-remix-event-is-taking-inspiration-from-diablo/1100-6533961/" data-ref-id="1100-6533961">Legion Remix event</a> will include plenty of new and returning transmog options for players to collect, but one highly coveted set of Artifact appearances from the original Legion expansion won't be among them.</p><p dir="ltr">Legion, originally released in 2016, is one of WoW's most popular expansions. That popularity is, in part, due to its Artifact-weapon system. Every player was granted an iconic weapon from Warcraft lore to upgrade over the course of the expansion. Because WoW's real endgame is transmog, each Artifact weapon also sported a variety of different skins and color variations for players to pursue and collect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573453" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4573453"></a><figcaption>WoW Legion Remix's content schedule.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4573453-wowlegionremixschedule.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, as part of Legion Remix, players are getting a second chance at the expansion. In a <a href="https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/not-adding-non-mage-tower-artifact-appearances-to-remix/589492/2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a> from WoW community manager Kaivax, Blizzard clarified that nearly all of Legion's original Artifact-weapon appearances (minus ones available only through PvP, since Legion Remix is a PvE-only event) will be available during the event. Many of these Artifact appearances are technically still earnable in the modern version of the game, though Legion Remix's increased leveling speeds and power levels will make leveling new characters for the event and blasting through some of the prerequisites faster.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Legion Remix, you'll have a great opportunity to obtain Artifact appearances that you haven't already," Kaivax said.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there is one notable exception--Mage Tower Artifact appearances. One of Legion's most innovative additions, the Mage Tower was introduced later on in the expansion and served as a challenge mode for various class specializations. Completing the different Mage Tower challenges originally granted exclusive Artifact weapon tints. However, once Legion ended, the Mage Tower was removed, as were its rewards. While Blizzard did eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-popular-mage-tower-is-becoming-a-permanent-feature/1100-6501781/" data-ref-id="1100-6501781">bring the Mage Tower back</a> with new rewards, many of the original rewards, including exclusive Artifact-weapon tints, weren't made available.</p><p dir="ltr">Those Artifact appearances won't be obtainable in Legion Remix, either, and will thus remain unobtainable for all of those who didn't complete the various Mage Tower challenges back when it was originally available.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players have long hoped Blizzard would bring back the ability to earn the original Mage Tower appearances, first when it was reintroduced in 2022 and now as part of Legion Remix. Blizzard, however, laid out its reasoning for excluding these rewards when Legion Remix was first announced, and is continuing to stick to its guns.</p><p dir="ltr">"Many times throughout the history of World of Warcraft, there have been items, titles, and other kinds of rewards that belong in a category of the most prestigious and historic accomplishments--rewards that we believe should be preserved in a historical context for only those players who earned them at the time," Kaivax wrote in a July <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/whats-your-wishlist-for-lemix-part-1/2085628/153" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Legion Remix will launch as part of WoW's 11.2.5 patch on October 7. Like last year's Mists of Pandaria Remix event, those looking to participate won't need to purchase WoW's latest expansion but will need a subscription or game time in order to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Legion Remix will speedrun through the expansion's original content by releasing its content patches in chunks every two weeks. Players will be able to earn all kinds of new and returning cosmetic rewards, as well as level up their Artifact to even greater levels than ever before. That extra power can then be put to the test with the event's new, Diablo-inspired Heroic World Tier and Timeworn Mythic+ Keystone dungeons.</p>

Players will travel the seas, explore new lands, and build cities as they make the best of things while the "oppressive demands" of the cat overlords are asking for more and more.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouXnSla_wUI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ouXnSla_wUI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Establish waste management and healthcare facilities, ensure buildings are properly heated and maintained, and send forth your mice to fell trees, mine mountains, and tend to the fields and fish," reads a line from the game's description. "The cats will demand their due, and your own citizens will abandon the colony if their needs aren't met on a daily basis--you must strike a perfect balance between the needs of the mouse and the demands of the cat."</p><p>Players must build complex systems to like pipelines for water flow, conveyor belts, and ramps to move goods quickly from one place to another, and spend time R&amp;D efforts to find new technologies to "bring a bright future for mousekind."</p><p>"There's only so far a mouse can be pushed before it must push back--the demands of the cat grow more unreasonable by the day, and they care not for the suffering with which these demands are met," reads a line from the game's description. "Come rain or shine, the shipments must be fulfilled to feline satisfaction lest they call upon their henchmen to violently remind you of your duties. Will you forever serve this oppressive paw? Or will you raise your whiskers in defiance?"</p><p>In other news, an Xbox boss recently said Game Pass is getting its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-gets-largest-investment-to-date-this-year-xbox-boss-says/1100-6534902/" data-ref-id="1100-6534902">"largest investment" to date this year</a>, amid criticisms of the service from a range of people, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-downside-of-game-pass-according-to-a-former-xbox-boss/1100-6534539/" data-ref-id="1100-6534539">including former Xbox executives</a>.</p><p><em>For more: </em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-game-pass-titles/1100-6534406/" data-ref-id="1100-6534406">Upcoming Game Pass Titles In 2025 And Beyond</a></p>
