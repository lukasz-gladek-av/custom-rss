                <p>If you've been noticing that recent matches of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> are ending in a lot more PvP skirmishes than usual, there's a high likelihood that you might've had it coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent interview</a> with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi, the CEO of Embark Studios, Patrick Söderlund, confirmed that the popular extraction shooter has recently been employing a kind of "aggression-based matchmaking" to group up more like-minded players.</p><p>During an inquiry about the studio's approach to matchmaking, Söderlund said, "Since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE, and have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up."</p><p>The news seems to confirm what many players in the Arc Raiders community have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">suspected</a> for a while now. In the last few weeks alone, there has been a steady increase in fervor around the notion of an aggression-based matchmaking system, especially as players found that they were running into more competitive lobbies. This is especially notable given the fact that much of the conversation around Arc Raiders at launch seemed to focus on how welcoming its playerbase was compared to the communities of other, more hostile extraction shooters, like Escape From Tarkov.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with PC Gamer</a> in December also yielded comments about "behavior-based matchmaking" which seemed to rile up players who felt justified in their theories.</p><p>Now though, it's all out in the open, though it isn't just as simple as matchmaking based on your kill count. As Söderlund is quick to clarify, there are several different levels of matchmaking going on at the same time in any Arc Raiders match. "First, it's skill-based, of course. Then, you have solos, duos, and trios, "Söderlund claimed. Then after that, Arc Raiders matches you based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players.</p><p>The way Söderlund talks about it, it sounds like team always figured that as the game grew in size it'd need to deploy measures like this to more fairly group the differently segments of the game community.</p><p>At least this way, players who want to maintain the more cooperative ambiance of those early Arc Raiders days can maintain that for longer, while the bloodthirsty looters of the Rust Belt are free to pick each other clean in their own lobbies.</p>

      </div>
<p>Content creator VarsityGaming, who's been <a href="https://x.com/VarsityGamingTV/status/2007933363332731017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memeing the hack</a> since it happened on January 4, corroborated the 67-day ban on their social media, suggesting that Siege may be down for two more days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rainbow servers are still experiencing problems after 16 hours of the hacking incident happening, AGAIN.<br>Varsitygaming, the streamer who got the "67" day ban explains on the situation on how he can still matchmake even though he has supposedly been "banned".<br>At this point, it… <a href="https://t.co/9Ee0C396qX" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9Ee0C396qX</a></p>  — AllAboutGaming (@AllAbtGaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/AllAbtGaming/status/2008155122912620631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">status page for Rainbow Six Siege</a> also underscores the unfortunate situation. At the time of this writing, every platform is experiencing "unplanned issues," impacting the game's connectivity, in-game store, and matchmaking. The website claims that some of these issues are being investigated, with the publisher thanking players for their patience during this weird time.</p><p>While 67 days seems like an absurd amount of time--and in the case of VarsityGaming, it was "<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTGPYamkcRA/#" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">67676767 days</a>"--the number is really a reference to the 6-7 meme. Originating in March 2025 in part by rapper Skrilla (and their December 2024 song "Doot Doot (6 7)") and point guard LaMelo Ball (who's six-feet-seven-inches tall), the two numbers together went viral on social media largely thanks to someone named Maverick Trevillian, who became known as the "67 Kid." An absurdist inside joke that has no emotional, political, or sexual connotation, 6-7 literally means nothing and is the epitome of brain rot. And because it means nothing, that's why it's so popular; it's just another way for kids to get under adults' skin.</p><p>This hack comes nearly two weeks after Rainbow Six Siege went down for two days after the Christmas holiday. According to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2ep8ykky0ro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The BBC</a>, the game's servers were taken offline between December 27 and 28 following the marketplace being flooded with in-game currency that was reportedly worth millions of dollars. Ubisoft said at the time that "investigations and corrections" were going to be made over the next two weeks. It's unclear if this current hack is at all related to this previous hack.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege went through a major rebrand in the middle of last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-gets-most-transformative-update-ever-today-with-siege-x-launch/1100-6532322/" data-ref-id="1100-6532322">becoming Rainbow Six Siege X</a>. This transformation, which introduced tons of improvements and changes to the tactical shooter, brought in a huge swath of new and returning players, reaching 142,000 concurrents on Steam on June 10, 2025. That's not quite the all-time peak of 201,933 it achieved on May 17, 2024, but for a 10-year-old game, that's still an impressive accomplishment.</p>

The controller has a classic D-pad on the left and 12 face buttons, including the traditional four-button layout found on modern controllers.

Similar to its Ultimate controllers for PC and console, these smartphone controller cradles are officially licensed and offer an impressive amount of features for their budget-friendly price.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png" data-ref-id="1300-4629323"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4629323-8bitdophonecontroller.png"></figure><p>These have Hall Effect sticks, face buttons, a retro-style D-pad, and contoured tactile handles.

RDR2 players have uncovered a pattern of web that only shows up on the map at a certain time of day, and the ultimate destination of this mystery hasn't been fully solved yet.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strange Man YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-discovery-in-red-dead-redemption-2-in-years-rockstar-fans-uncover-spiderweb-mystery-unnoticed-since-release-and-now-the-hunt-is-on-for-answers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) shared the first video guide to the webs, and credited the discovery to three players: goldenplaysterraria, pariah87, and u/FL4VA-01. Like the dreamcatchers quest in the game, players can shoot the webs and get them to release a feather. However, there's only a one-hour window in-game to find a web, and each web only appears at a specific time throughout the in-game night cycle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSQPMaU7yz8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OSQPMaU7yz8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a follow-up video, Strange Man reveals the location of a ninth web in the middle of the spider puzzle, which leads to a telephone pole and more clues. The search is currently centered on a guitar symbol, and players are combing over Fort Wallace, since it's the closest location with guitars to the newly discovered symbol.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0T4J8LYqUi0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0T4J8LYqUi0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-passes-mario-kart-8-on-all-time-game-sales-list/1100-6536028/" data-ref-id="1100-6536028">Red Dead Redemption 2 passed Mario Kart 8</a> on the all-time list of video game best-sellers, with 79 million copies sold.

The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a> was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-new-modern-upgrade-shown-off-in-first-gameplay-footage/1100-6536618/" data-ref-id="1100-6536618">upgraded for modern consoles</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-new-version-launched-with-a-big-issue-on-xbox/1100-6536648/" data-ref-id="1100-6536648">Xbox users didn't automatically receive theirs</a> as planned.

                <p>Sometimes you get so into a game that you scream uncontrollably. Whether that be a curse word or an SOS, if you yell loud enough, someone will come to your rescue. At least that's what happened to one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> player, whose door was kicked in by a concerned neighbor after he heard the player yelling for help.</p><p>Redditor dreamthorp <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ARC_Raiders/comments/1q35psm/neighbor_heard_me_yelling_help_in_arc_raiders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a 16-second clip of the incident</a> on the Arc Raiders subreddit on January 3. They said they were playing a night raid on the Dam Battlegrounds, the game's very first map. While trying to extract from an elevator, a Leaper reportedly pounced on and downed them before the elevator doors shut. "I just wanted to get stabilized so I could leave," dreamthorp said in the comments of their Reddit post. It's at this point that they started screaming, "Somebody help me."</p><p>Well, somebody did come to help. As displayed on the door's Ring camera, a concerned neighbor walked over, knocked, and asked if they were "all good." Dreamthorp screamed for help again, at which point the concerned neighbor--a firefighter, according to dreamthorp--stepped back, assumed a stance, and kicked the door in, an action that allegedly corrupted the Ring camera's file.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Concerned neighbor attempts to break down door as player repeatedly shouts for 'help' during an 'ARC Raiders' game 😂<br>The player gave him a six-pack of beers for trying to help out<br>(via u/dreamthorp) <a href="https://t.co/6Qpufew4ID" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Qpufew4ID</a></p>  — Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureCrave/status/2007892644694024323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Dreamthorp clarified in the comments that they were house-sitting for a friend when the incident happened. The door didn't break (and if it did, they said they would've bought their friend a new door), but dreamthorp figured that "one more kick and I’m pretty sure it would’ve busted." That's even with two deadbolts locked. After their heart nearly popped out of their chest because "the door bulged like an explosion was behind it," dreamthorp then unlocked the door, laughed with the supposed firefighter neighbor, and "dapped him up." They also dropped off a six-pack of Shiner Bock beers as a thank you for his natural instinct and quick action.</p><p>The commenters on dreamthorp's post were largely divided. Some found the moment very wholesome, calling the firefighter a "good dude" and a "real bro" for acting when someone might've been in need. (In a video game, that is.) Others questioned the veracity of dreamthorp's video, with folks wondering why it didn't show the firefighter neighbor actually kicking the door in.</p><p>Dreamthorp, who claimed to be a videographer in the comments, said corrupted files happen "all the time," especially when you turn off a camera while it's recording or pull out the SD card when transferring data. Regardless, dreamthorp purported that the two "scared the ever-living sh*t out of each other" in that moment.</p><p>Arc Raiders has found itself in the hot seat lately over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">its use of artificial intelligence</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">developer Embark Studios defending the controversial technology</a> because of the "tremendous benefits" it offers players and developers. Despite the criticism, the extraction shooter continues to be a smash success, reaching 3.2 million daily active users on January 4 across platforms.</p>
