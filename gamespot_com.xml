                <p>Player choices have been a big part of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and that's still going to be true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. However, for any fans who don't want to agonize over which branching dialogue option to pick or who to romance, Ubisoft is introducing a new canon mode in Shadows that will let the players simply experience the story without having to make any choices of their own.</p><p>Shadows director Jonathan Dumont revealed the new option during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit appearance</a> alongside other developers from the game.</p><p>"Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and [romancing] some of the characters," said Dumont. "Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called Canon Mode which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice-free experience. Hope this makes it fun for everyone."</p><p>Dumont also noted that Shadows is close to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review/1900-6416794/" data-ref-id="1900-6416794">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> in terms of scale. Associate Narrative Director Brooke Davies added that the two main characters, Naoe and Yasuke, can pick their preferred romantic partners outside of Canon Mode for both "shorter and longer romance opportunities." She also said, "The story of Shadows culminates in a single, [canonical] ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."</p><p>The developers confirmed that Shadows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-introduce-a-new-direction-for-its-modern-day-story/1100-6527555/" data-ref-id="1100-6527555">will introduce a new direction for the modern-day storyline</a>. Dumont indicated that Shadows "will be different than what we have done in the past, but that is connected to our modern-day lore and will develop over time in the Animus Hub and subsequent titles." He also said that Hattori Hanzō from Assassin's Creed: Memories will appear in Shadows.</p><p>Additionally, Davies indicated that Naoe and Yasuke won't immediately be on the same side.</p><p>"Their paths do ultimately converge and we see them form a league together around common cause," said Davies. "That said, this path is not always smooth and straight, and their unique backgrounds and perspectives do not always align. This is something we will see them and sometimes even help them to work through by making some interesting choices."</p><p>Ubisoft recently shared a lengthy overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-dramatically-alter-how-it-plays-based-on-your-character-and-weapons/1100-6528362/" data-ref-id="1100-6528362">how combat will work in Shadows</a>. Details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">the game's battle pass</a> have leaked online, and Ubisoft has stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-clarifies-rumors-about-animus-hub-the-new-name-of-assassins-creed-infinity/1100-6527804/" data-ref-id="1100-6527804">the rewards in the Animus Hub are free</a>. Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

During a recent interview, Treyarch's Associate Creative Director Miles Leslie hinted that the team already has its favorite maps to revisit, and no map is off the table.</p><p>"We put a ton of consideration into the prospective remasters with each new game," Leslie told <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-dev-hints-at-more-classic-map-remasters-in-the-works-3004483/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dextero</a>. "We know there are certain fan favorites that players would like to see again, and we have some of our own favorites that we've had on a wish list over the years. I'll just say that while we're still focused on delivering original designs as the majority of our post-launch maps, no previous Black Ops title is off the table for potential remasters."</p><p>Earlier this month, a Call of Duty leaker reported <a href="https://twitter.com/ForwardLeaksAlt/status/1865886089459724507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1865886089459724507%7Ctwgr%5E6a71a8dbfc6110c6c0e803b26c91df7fe95a62f3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fcod-leak-reveals-fan-favorite-black-ops-map-set-to-return-in-near-future-3002067%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the Launch map</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-review/1900-6283815/" data-ref-id="1900-6283815">Call of Duty: Black Ops 1</a> will return with a new title, Cosmodome, in either Black Ops 6 or the next Call of Duty game that's coming in 2025. This rumor has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Prior to the launch of Season 1, Treyarch laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-black-ops-6-gameplay-trial-is-coming-this-month-provides-access-to-zombies-and-multiplayer/1100-6528203/" data-ref-id="1100-6528203">everything players can expect to see in Black Ops 6</a>. The developer also revealed that a free trial for Black Ops 6's multiplayer and Zombies modes will begin on December 13 for a limited time. Players also recently discovered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-players-discover-game-ending-nuke-easter-egg/1100-6528328/" data-ref-id="1100-6528328">a game-ending Easter egg</a> in Black Ops 6's Nuketown.
