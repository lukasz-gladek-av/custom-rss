                <p>Elden Ring developer From Software has announced that Nightreign will indeed add two-player co-op following the studio's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-doesnt-elden-ring-nightreign-have-two-player-co-op-the-reason-may-surprise-you/1100-6531760/" data-ref-id="1100-6531760">admission about overlooking this in development</a>.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1929780349380223096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, From Software said it will add "Duo Expeditions" sometime down the road. On the more immediate horizon is the introduction of "enhanced fights with existing Nightlords" beginning this month. The developer did not provide any specifics on what it meant by "enhanced."</p><p>Nightreign is also getting unspecified DLC in the future as part of the game's ongoing support.</p><p>As for why Nightreign launched without two-player co-op, game director Junya Ishizaki told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the studio "overlooked" this possibility during development. "So we're very sorry about that," he said.</p><p>Ishizaki explained that Nightreign is balanced for people to play solo or with groups of three. With From Software spending so much time and attention trying to nail the experience for solo and three-player <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">co-op</a>, this meant two-player co-op wasn't considered.</p><p>"In putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect," Ishizaki said. Just this week, Nightreign received a patch that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-include-promised-improvements-for-solo-play/1100-6531974/" data-ref-id="1100-6531974">helped improve the experience for solo players</a>.</p><p>After five days, Nightreign has reached 3.5 million players, From Software announced. Big success was expected, given Elden Ring itself sold more than 30 million copies and had fans clamoring for more.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Nightreign, be sure to consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Nightreign guides hub</a>, in which we discuss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-you-need-to-know-before-you-play/2900-6611/" data-ref-id="2900-6611">top tips to know</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how multiplayer works</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-skins-in-elden-ring-nightreign-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6614/" data-ref-id="2900-6614">how to unlock all the skins</a>, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Nightreign review</a> scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Richard Wakeling said the game "condenses Elden Ring into a thrilling, fast-paced, and aggressive multiplayer experience."</p>

                <p>Sony has announced the latest PlayStation State of Play presentation. Airing on June 4 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, the show will run for roughly 40 minutes and feature "news and updates" on a variety of as-of-now-undisclosed PS5 games.</p><p>The presentation will be available to stream on PlayStation's official <a href="http://play.st/twitch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> and <a href="http://play.st/YouTube" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> channels. It's the latest presentation announced for an increasingly busy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">game-conference period</a> that also includes Summer Game Fest, the Xbox Games Showcase, and the PC Gaming Show, among many others.</p><p>As for what is going to be shown during the presentation, that remains to be seen. Sony has a number of previously announced games in development at its first-party studios, including Marathon from Bungie and Saros from Housemarque. The next big PS5 exclusive is Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which launches later this month.</p><p>One other studio that is staying very busy is Naughty Dog. The developer currently has two projects in the works--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> as well as a mystery game. It's possibly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part 3</a>, though writer-director Neil Druckmann won't say if that game is ever getting made.</p>

The idea, many thought, was that Activision was intrusively trying to push microtransactions on players in a new way.</p><p>Now, Activision has disabled this and claimed it was only a "test" that was added to the game by accident. Fans aren't buying that explanation, however.</p><p>"A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game," <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision said.</a></p><p>The replies to Activision's post are full of people claiming Activision is gaslighting fans and offering a poor excuse for what happened. Some people replied to say the new UI feature was helpful to them, as it surfaced a specific weapon or bundle that they might have otherwise never seen.</p><p>In any event, the feature is now gone, but its removal isn't likely to do much to quell the concerns of some that Call of Duty is pushing microtransactions on players. The game regularly highlights paid DLC bundles that players can spend money on to acquire new operators, guns, and other items. This is a fairly common practice for many online multiplayer games.</p><p>Call of Duty's newest store bundle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">brings Ana de Armas' character from the John Wick movie Ballerina to the game</a>, and it launches today.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a> There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-the-overlook-safe-room-in-call-of-duty-warzone/1100-6531953/" data-ref-id="1100-6531953">numerous new updates for Warzone, too.</a></p>

                <p>Roblox game Grow A Garden is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-roblox-game-is-blowing-up-in-popularity/1100-6531728/" data-ref-id="1100-6531728">continuing to see massive numbers</a> of players, reaching a new high that's more than triple the Steam concurrent players record set by PUBG back in its heyday. The Roblox game is a farming-sim-meets-idle-game, but there's something about Grow A Garden that's seen it smashing records both on Roblox and off.</p><p>After a new update was released for the game--which are officially referred to as "experiences" on Roblox--the concurrent-player number shot to a new high of 11,694,315, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-game-grow-a-garden-suddenly-shatters-several-all-time-player-count-records-3196238/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reports</a>. The <a href="https://guinness-world-records.fandom.com/wiki/Roblox_records" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Guinness World Records Fandom wiki</a> has Grow A Garden breaking multiple Roblox platform records, including most visits in 10 minutes, most visits in 1 hour, most visits gained in a day, most visits gained in a week, and overall most concurrent players.</p><p>To put that in context, the record for most concurrent players on Steam belongs to PUBG, which saw an all-time high of 3,257,248 back when it started the trend for battle royale games. That's less than a third of what Grow A Garden is seeing on Roblox. To compare to another evergreen battle royale title, Fortnite's all-time concurrent record is over 14 million--a record Grow A Garden hasn't beaten yet, but it is surprisingly close to it.</p><p>Grow A Garden released in late March, and since then its popularity has eclipsed other popular Roblox games like Dress to Impress, Blox Fruits, and Adopt Me. The game was developed by an unknown teenage developer, but a studio called Splitting Point has now stepped in to manage it.</p><p>The farming genre has produced a number of surprise hits before--Farmville enjoyed similar viral success on Facebook over 15 years ago, while Stardew Valley remains popular almost 10 years after it was first released. Grow A Garden's idle gameplay likely adds to its popularity--players can plant seeds and let them grow while they're offline, making it an easy game to get into even with little time to play.</p>
