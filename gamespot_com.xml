                <p>Nintendo enjoyed enormous success in the film department with The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned more than $1.3 billion worldwide. Now, Nintendo is gearing up to release The Super Mario Galaxy Movie in 2026, with a live-action The Legend of Zelda film to follow in 2027. More films based on Nintendo properties <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-teases-more-movies-to-come/1100-6535943/" data-ref-id="1100-6535943">could come next</a>, and Nintendo has now said moviemaking is something Nintendo wants to be "even more actively involved in going forward."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a> that Nintendo is keen to pursue moviemaking because it believes films can become long-term assets for the company as it looks to the future beyond games.</p><p>Nintendo has an internal unit called Nintendo Pictures, which is conducting experiments in the video space, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">recent Pikmin shorts</a>. But Nintendo Pictures won't be the team that handles future feature films--that work is being done by established Hollywood studios like Universal and Illumination.</p><p>"For movies, there is an established business framework where the distribution companies manage movies. The past indicates that following that established structure and creating content with care and attention leads to profits," Furukawa said.</p><p>Hollywood is an established machine with a "proven business model," Furukawa said, but Nintendo Pictures is a new unit trying to "take on various challenges in areas that have not yet clearly taken shape."</p><p>"The 'Close to You' Pikmin-themed short video that was released recently was created as an experiment based on this concept. We would like to continue providing this kind of content that generates enthusiasm around the world, and develop it into an important asset for Nintendo," Furukawa said.</p><p>No more Nintendo movies beyond the live-action Zelda film have been announced, but there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/" data-ref-id="1100-6533131">rumors of a Donkey Kong film.</a></p><p>Nintendo also recently discussed its general philosophy for filmmaking recently. The company said it doesn't simply license its properties to film studios. Instead, Nintendo is involved in the financing and "deeply involved" in production. Shigeru Miyamoto, for example, produced The Super Mario Bros. Movie and will be a producer on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie and the Zelda movie, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-from-sony-and-nintendo-is-now-filming-apparently/1100-6535988/" data-ref-id="1100-6535988">just began filming in New Zealand. </a></p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie made a gargantuan $1.36 billon at the global box office, ranking as the No. 2 highest-grossing movie of 2023, only behind Barbie ($1.44 billion). The Super Mario Bros. Movie ranks as the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/ww_top_lifetime_gross/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 18 highest-grossing movie in history.</a></p><p>"It was enjoyed by a vast audience, including those who had experienced Mario games, those less familiar with gaming, and people of all ages, from children to seniors," Nintendo said. "What has pleased us most about this film, even more than the measurable results, are the warm comments we received from so many people."</p><p>Nintendo's gaming business is booming at the moment, thanks in part to the recent launch of the Switch 2. It's sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">more than 10 million units thus far</a>, becoming Nintendo's fastest-selling platform ever. Nintendo is enthusiastic about its sales potential this holiday, recently boosting the console's sales projections from 15 million to 19 million for the fiscal year that ends in March 2026.</p>

                <p>Whenever a new mainline Pokemon game rolls around, you can expect not one but two versions of the same game to hit the shelves. That's a sales decision that was made with a primary goal in mind--to give Nintendo's iconic plumber Mario a run for his money.</p><p>During an investor Q&amp;A this week, Nintendo veteran Shigeru Miyamoto spoke about a meeting he once had with Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri, who joked that the only way to beat Mario Kart in sales was to sell two copies of Pokemon to each consumer. Miyamoto says this was one of the reasons why the first Pokemon game was released as Pokemon Blue and Pokemon Red, which is a tradition that was continued since then with most mainline games.</p><p>"That is one reason why Pokémon started with both Pokémon Red and Pokémon Blue," <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow ">Miyamoto said</a>. "I believe that new ideas are born precisely because of people like him, who challenge themselves to surpass what came before."</p><p>These Pokemon games typically offer exclusive Pokemon for players to collect, and as of Pokemon Silver and Gold, two distinct legendary Pokemon that can only be found in their respective games. Of course, trading Pokemon is a big part of the experience as well, and recent games have made the process of completing your Pokedex easier thanks to advances in online connectivity. There are still fans who are completionists at heart and will buy both versions of a Pokemon game, with Nintendo even selling two-packs to cater to player demand.</p><p>This year marked the 30th anniversary of Pokemon, and while a new Generation 10 game wasn't released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet did get a Switch 2 upgrade</a> that greatly improved the game on the new Nintendo hardware. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A was also released</a>, and it saw players return to Lumiose City for the first time since Pokemon X and Y on the Nintendo 3DS.</p><p>In the business department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Nintendo has reported that it has sold 10.36 million Switch 2</a> units as of September 30, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="nofollow ">Mario Kart World has sold 9.57 million units so far</a>. The company also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-vast-majority-of-nintendo-switch-2-owners-transitioned-from-switch-1/1100-6535947/">84% of Switch 2 owners previously owned a Switch 1 console</a>, and while it'll still sell the older console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-switch-will-not-be-removed-from-sale-but-nintendo-will-focus-on-switch-2-going-forward/1100-6535968/">Nintendo will focus on the Switch 2 going forward</a>.</p>

                <p>The next BioShock game has been in development for the better part of a decade, but 2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that there are no plans currently to cancel it. In a new interview, CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the lengthy development cycle, promising that BioShock will eventually be released.</p><p>"It's going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," Zelnick said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. The CEO added that with longer development cycles for AAA games, it had become more challenging to build a game that can stand out from the pack as part of its quality-over-quantity mindset. "The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly, a precious few times," Zelnick boasted, adding that Take-Two is aiming to release "exceptional" games.</p><p>Zelnick's comments come in the wake of a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg report about BioShock 4 undergoing a partial overhaul</a> to improve on key areas. Meanwhile, Take-Two president Karl Slatoff also addressed the status of BioShock during this week's earnings call and spoke about changes at Cloud Chamber following layoffs at the studio. This led to the departure of studio head Kelley Gilmore, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">with former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson taking ove</a>r.</p><p>"We've made some changes in the organization," Slatoff said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>). "We're shifting some things around. But right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that's going to exceed consumers' expectations. So not much more to update other than that and the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises."</p><p>In other news from Take-Two's earnings call, the company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">GTA 6 had been delayed to November 2026</a>, and despite being the third-highest-selling game of the year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/">Borderlands 4 has fallen short of sales expectations</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is climbing up the sales charts, surpassing Nintendo's best-selling Mario Kart game ever. As part of Take-Two's latest earnings report, the company disclosed that the 2018 open-world Western sold another 2 million copies in the past three months to climb to 79 million overall.</p><p>In reaching that mark, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 2014's Mario Kart 8 on the list for all-time game sales. Mario Kart 8 has sold 78.02 million units--this includes 69.56 million units sold for Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and 8.46 million copies of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U.</p><p>Of note, however, is that the Mario Kart 8 sales figure is inflated in a way that can't be said for Red Dead Redemption 2, as the Mario Kart 8 sales numbers include pack-in sales. Given that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the centerpiece of Nintendo's annual Black Friday and holiday bundles, copies of the game sold in bundles are surely numerous.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now the No. 5 best-selling game of all time, only beaten by Tetris (520 million), Minecraft (300 million), GTA 5 (220 million), and Wii Sports (82.9 million).</p><p>Given the immense success of Red Dead Redemption 2, many are expecting Rockstar to make a third game in the series.

Rockstar has yet to confirm this, but the ports are rumored to launch this year.</p><p>Rockstar's next project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">delayed to November 2026.</a></p><p>As for the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart World was a launch title for the Switch 2 and has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 9.57 million copies so far.</a></p>
