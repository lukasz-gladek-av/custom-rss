                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">have made it pretty clear</a> that they don't want the game to follow in the footsteps of Call of Duty with its celebrity operators and cartoon-like skins featuring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">Beavis and Butt-head</a>. Now, EA and Battlefield Studios appear to be poking fun at Call of Duty with a live-action Battlefield 6 trailer that introduces some celebrities soldiers before ruthlessly dispatching them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EunkRPRzECg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EunkRPRzECg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zac Efron, Jimmy Butler, Morgan Wallen, and Paddy Pimblett play themselves as the warriors who prove to be expendable in more ways than one. This video appears to be a callback to Call of Duty's "There's A Soldier In All Of Us" series of trailers that featured all manner of celebrities, including Sam Worthington, Jonah Hill, and Dwight Howard. The celebrities operators had a much easier time in that video than they did with Battlefield 6's urban chaos and destructible locations.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has already had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-new-campaign-trailer-featuring-tons-of-explosions-during-state-of-play/1100-6534997/" data-ref-id="1100-6534997">a launch trailer for its campaign</a>, which highlighted the extent that bringing down buildings can reshape the game. Another trailer put the spotlight on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-what-battlefield-6s-portal-mode-can-let-you-create-in-wild-new-trailer/1100-6535026/" data-ref-id="1100-6535026">Battlefield 6's Portal mode</a>. That's the part of the game that puts tools in the hands of players and lets them create customized maps that inject more chaos into the battles.</p><p>DICE boss Rebecka Coutaz recently noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-felt-an-obligation-to-make-a-better-game-after-2042-stumbled/1100-6534972/" data-ref-id="1100-6534972">she felt an obligation</a> to deliver a greatly improved incarnation of Battlefield following the disappointing response to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. GameSpot has shared its<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-story-campaign-lets-you-have-fun-with-destruction-when-it-wants-to/1100-6534987/" data-ref-id="1100-6534987"> first impressions of the game</a>, following a hands-on preview. Fans will be able to get their chance to weigh in when Battlefield 6 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.</p>
