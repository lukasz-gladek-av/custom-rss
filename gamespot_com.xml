                <p>This week, From Software's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is expanding with The Forsaken Hollows DLC, which adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/we-played-elden-ring-nightreigns-new-characters-for-6-hours/2300-6466558/" data-ref-id="2300-6466558">two new playable characters</a>, two extra bosses, and a fresh Shifting Earth event. But if you want to play that DLC, then you'll need to add the new Nightreign Version 1.03 patch across PC and consoles.</p><p>One of the primary changes in this patch is that the trigger conditions for Relic effects have been broadened. The game's passive effects have been increased, which include greater attacking power when using two-handed weapons or armaments, as well as chain attacks, charge attacks, and jump attacks.</p><p>The Wrath of Gold incantation has been given a power boost, while decreasing the cost to players' FP consumption. There are a number of bug fixes in this patch as well, including one that was teleporting players to the wrong area during the Augur invasion if they were performing a critical hit at the time. Under certain conditions, players weren't able to activate Sites of Grace or Churches, but the notes say the issue has been "mitigated."</p><p>If you want to unlock The Forsaken Hollows' new characters and face the new bosses, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-the-forsaken-hollows/1100-6536650/" data-ref-id="1100-6536650">guide to starting the new DLC</a>.
