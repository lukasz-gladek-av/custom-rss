                <p>Another day, another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, this one notably bringing sweet relief to couples forced to have a third wheel everywhere as it adds in a highly requested two-player expeditions mode. This new option doesn't change the game all that much--it simply lets two people play together as opposed to the solo and trio options that were available before. You'll now also find that the Expedition Type setting name has been changed to Number of Players, and the game has apparently been balanced for just two players as well.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of quality-of-life improvements listed in the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-102?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=NR_Patch102" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a>, one big one is that new filtering options are available on the relic effect filter screen so you have a "more precise selection of relic effects." If you choose multiple effects for one condition, any of your relics that match up with your chosen effects will show up too, but if you choose multiple effects for several conditions, only relics that have those exact conditions will be displayed. You can set up to 100 relic presets now as well, and there's an option to sell and favorite acquired relics in the rewards and purchasing menus.</p>
