                <p>In the NFL, when players pull off something special on the field, fans occasionally refer to it as a "video-game move." But Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley took that to another level earlier this season when he evaded a defender by jumping over him while looking the other way. EA couldn't resist adding that no-look hurdle to the latest update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a>, but Barkley is the only player who can use it and it's not easy to pull off.</p><p>As part of the notes for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/title-update-november-20-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the new Madden NFL 25 update</a>, EA explained that the development team immediately decided to put Barkley's "once-in-a-lifetime move" in the game by combing through hours of motion-capture footage. From there, they determined which animations could be modified to recreate Barkley's leap, with some additional help from "animator magic" to complete the move.</p><p>While that move would be incredibly useful for any player, the developers have put some restrictions on it beyond limiting to Barkley's in-game avatar. In order to perform a Saquon spin hurdle, the defender has to approach the front of the player at a 45-degree angle. The move also requires very precise timing, as well as close proximity between the player and the defender. So it's possible, but it may not be the guaranteed outcome of every play under those circumstances.</p><p>Later this month, Amazon's Prime Video will debut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-trailer-for-its-in-the-game-shares-the-history-of-madden-nfl/1100-6527695/" data-ref-id="1100-6527695">It's in the Game</a>, a four-part documentary series about the history and development of the Madden NFL games. That show will hit Prime Video on November 26. Further into the future, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicolas-cage-will-star-as-john-madden-in-biopic-about-the-nfl-legend/1100-6525859/" data-ref-id="1100-6525859">Nicolas Cage will play John Madden</a> in a new biopic from writer and director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-studded-movie-amsterdam-flops-could-lose-100-million-report/1100-6508153/" data-ref-id="1100-6508153">David O. Russell</a>.</p><p>The complete list of changes and notes for Madden NFL 25's new update is below:</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><ul><li>Triggering the Saquon Spin Hurdle - To trigger the spin hurdle the ball-carrier must be Saquon Barkley, the defender must be incoming from a 45 degree angle in front of the ball carrier, the defender must be within a close proximity to the ball carrier, and the user must press the hurdle button with the right timing.</li><li>Addressed an issue where users were able to create illegal formations by motioning the tight end after an audible  <ul><li><em>DEV NOTE: This tactic was most effective when having the offense audible into formations like Trips TE or Bunch TE. Users could motion the tight end over to the same side as the trips receivers and create offensive overloads. The formations created were not legal formations and this functionality has been removed.</em></li></ul></li><li>Fixed the QB walking through the center on QB Kneel plays. The QB now is in the correct position to start and walks into the correct position behind the center</li><li>Fixed the defensive end lining up in the same spot as the defensive tackle in the 4-3 Over Solid formation</li><li>Addressed an issue where no power kicks would land at spots in the front of the landing zone that were difficult for the kicking team to recover  <ul><li><em>DEV NOTE: There has been a change made to kick power and ball placement so no power kicks will now fall short of the landing zone. There will need to be at 25% power for the ball to make it to the landing zone</em></li></ul></li><li>Fixed an issue with outside deep fourth defenders biting down on return routes instead of staying deep</li><li>Fixed an issue where deep zone defenders would not keep depth when they had no receiving threat in their zone and would allow Post Routes from the other side of the formation to get behind them</li><li>Fixed an issue where deep third defenders in Prevent defense were not all staying deeper than the deepest across the field</li><li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety would leave the slot receiver unguarded, going vertical in the Empty Bunch Verticals play</li><li>Fixed an issue where the inside deep fourth safety allowed the slot receiver in bunch formations on a streak to run past him for a TD</li><li>Fixed an issue where Seam Flat defenders in the Dime 1-4 FS Zone Blitz play were not covering the correct sides of the field against the Gun Bunch Str Nasty: MTN Curls play</li><li>Alignment improvements in Cover 4 Quarters, Palms, and Cover 6 where the outside Deep Fourth, Quarter Flat, and 3 Rec Hook triangulate their positioning against Bunch Receivers to handle first inside, and first to flat, and deep threat</li><li>Fixed an alignment issue where defenders were lining up in the wrong position on Nickel 3-3 Odd Pinch 0 allowing the middle slot receiver to be left unguarded in Empty sets</li><li>Fixed an issue where outside cornerbacks and inside cornerbacks would align side by side against a nub-set tight end (TE aligned next to the OT with no WRs outside of the TE)</li></ul><ul><li>Superstar X-Factor Updates:  <ul><li>New X-Factor Players  <ul><li>C.J.

                <p>A lot of big games are getting patches to take advantage of the PS5 Pro's power, but CD Projekt Red's Cyberpunk 2077 is not among them. The Polish developer confirmed this on social media in response to a question from a fan.</p><p>"We currently have no plans for [a] PS5 Pro patch," <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1859151714747552122?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio said</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). The wording here leaves the door open for these plans to change at some point down the line, but for now, no one should expect a PS5 Pro patch.</p><p>CD Projekt Red did not go into any further detail as to why it won't release a PS5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077. However, it might have something to do with how there is<a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1795474940520550428" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> no one at CD Projekt Red working on Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and that's been the case for months now. These staffers have moved on to other projects, including the next Cyberpunk and Witcher games.</p><p>When the PS5 Pro launched in early November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5758">a number of high-profile games were patched to support the console</a>, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Hogwarts Legacy, and Spider-Man 2. However, some PS5 Pro users reported that for games like Silent Hill 2, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, the PS5 Pro patches <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">actually made these games look worse.</a> For its part, EA <a href="https://x.com/EAStarWars/status/1858635462577172846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged the issues with Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and said its teams were investigating the issue.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is available now, priced at $700 USD. It's still early days, but Sony reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-huge-price-didnt-negatively-impact-sales-sony-says/1100-6527685/" data-ref-id="1100-6527685">the system's price tag didn't negatively impact sales.</a> In other PlayStation news, the next wave of the 30th-anniversary limited-edition slim PS5 model goes on sale via PlayStation Direct on November 21, starting at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET.</p>

                <p>Inin Games and Ys Net have announced that they received the publishing rights for Shenmue 3 from the game's previous publisher, Deep Silver. Inin Games has also teased more plans for Shenmue 3.</p><p>"Inin Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase," they said in a statement. "This collaboration marks the beginning of a new chapter for Shenmue 3, with Inin Games working closely alongside Ys Net to honor the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world."</p><p>It's unclear what plans Inin Games and Ys Net have in store for Shenmue 3, but it's possible that it could come to additional platforms such as Xbox and Switch. The game has been a console exclusive for PlayStation since 2019, as Sony helped fund the game.</p><p>In 2022, Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki said that he'd make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-creator-yu-suzuki-wants-to-make-shenmue-4-more-approachable-if-it-happens/1100-6503038/" data-ref-id="1100-6503038">Shenmue 4 more approachable</a> if given the chance to develop it. Although Shenmue 3 ends on a cliffhanger, he explained that a follow-up could tell a story completely separate from the events of that game. Earlier this year, Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">bought a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard</a> to campaign for a Shenmue 4, which managed to briefly get Shenmue trending on Twitter.</p><p>Shenmue 3 is currently available on PS4 and PC. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shenmue-3-review-from-a-forgotten-time/1900-6417374/" data-ref-id="1900-6417374">Shenmue 3 review</a>, we said, "Unfortunately, while it's fascinating as a weird curiosity from a long-gone era of gaming, it's simply not that fun to actually play."</p>

                <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks is ready to get work and play. A Microsoft veteran who joined Hasbro in 2016 as president of its Wizards of the Coast division--which includes Magic: The Gathering and all things Dungeons and Dragons--and wants to double down on bringing those worlds to the hands of video game players with new Magic and D&amp;D games in the works.</p><p>Cocks took the reins of the company in 2022 and saw an initial boom under his leadership during the pandemic, but as kids went back to school, sales slumped, and the company issued over 1,000 layoffs since. Hasbro had previously dedicated $1 billion to video game development. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> about this focus, Cocks indicated that $100-$150 million a year would be spent on games like Exodus, which will be developed by Archetype.</p><p>"We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands," Cocks explained. The CEO also confirmed that Hasbro was developing its own D&amp;D video game as well as the Wizards branch working on a video game focused on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/boost-your-magic-the-gathering-collection-with-these-early-black-friday-discounts/1100-6527839/" data-ref-id="1100-6527839">Commander format for Magic: The Gathering</a>. That's on top of a GI Joe action-adventure game that's already in pre-production.</p><p>D&amp;D games are nothing new with TSR working with Black Isle Studios and BioWare more than 25 years ago on the first Baldur's Gate game, which was set in the Forgotten Realms campaign and used the 2.5 Edition rules. There was even a video game for the Intellivision by Mattel. However, with the white-hot popularity of last year's Baldur's Gate 3, taking another stab at the franchise seems like a logical solution.</p><p>"What makes Magic so successful is what will drive Hasbro's future success," Cocks added. "It's grounded in play."</p><p>Cocks oversaw the sales growth of Magic leap to $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2023. That number has been attributed to Cocks' love for the game as he introduced new card packs for Magic and an online video game version called Magic: The Gathering Arena. He wants Hasbro to find a way to add more digital collectability to Magic, similar to Marvel Snap or, the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/#16" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Game Award nominee for Best Mobile Game</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket.</p><p>No information about either game was revealed, and with Larian Studios winding down its Baldur's Gate 3 work, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-game-and-discusses-decision-to-not-make-baldurs-gate-4/1100-6522165/" data-ref-id="1100-6522165">the decision to not continue with Baldur's Gate 4</a>, the possibilities feel limitless as to what these new games could look and play like.</p>
