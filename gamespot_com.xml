                <p>Nolan North is one of the most prolific voice actors of all time, lending his voice to hundreds of video games and animated series, but he didn't realize a character was supposed to be dead. That's mainly because Ubisoft told him he's still "technically" alive.</p><p>North had voiced Desmond Miles (among a few more characters) for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-assassins-creed-game-reviewed/2900-2178/" data-ref-id="2900-2178">Assassin's Creed series</a>. Desmond had been in five games, until the character's death in Assassin's Creed 3. It wasn't until he had gone online and came across fan reactions following the game's release that he was aware of this, however. </p><p>"That technically was Desmond's death scene, and I didn't know it," North told <a href="https://youtu.be/eEipR4kRQIE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Fall Damage</a>. "I found out on Twitter. 'Are you upset Desmond's dead?' And I'm thinking, what? Because there's no 'Argh!' There's nothing that you'd expect from a main character's death, although the good people at Ubisoft have told me that he's not technically dead."</p><p>Eight years after Assassin's Creed 3, in Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the actor returned to the franchise as a mysterious character named The Reader. Valhalla's ending explains that The Reader is Desmond--or the very least, his consciousness, which now lives on inside the Animus. It seems that Ubisoft creatives explained this to North years before he recorded the lines in Valhalla. Even then, it didn't seem that might have been the original plan either.</p><p>"I think the original idea was eight or nine games with Desmond," North continued. "But, as it so often goes in the entertainment industry, different developers, different creative directors come in, and they have their own way of continuing the story--and it's done very, very well."</p><p>The latest entry of the franchise, <a href="https://gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-target="true">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>, was released back in the spring after a handful of delays. There are also long-standing rumors about a Black Flag remake, which reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">will be Animus-free</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1990546725535429023" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, he said, "Experimenting doesn't equal 'in development' and companies often test to see if a game is possible on hardware."</p><p>Another person, Reece Reilly--who previously reported on a possible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">Switch 2 version of Red Dead Redemption 2</a>--<a href="https://x.com/kiwitalkz/status/1990464258333945976" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "no one internally has told me about a Switch 2 version of GTA 6." A person outside of Rockstar told him about GTA 6 for Switch 2, but no one at the company, he said.</p><p>For now, GTA 6 is confirmed only for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in November 2026. History suggests that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-fans-waiting-for-the-possible-pc-edition-now-have-to-wait-even-longer/1100-6536055/" data-ref-id="1100-6536055">PC edition will follow later, but this is not confirmed.</a></p><p>The last GTA game for a Nintendo platform was GTA: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition in 2022. GTA 5 never came to a Nintendo platform. In 2009, Rockstar developed GTA: Chinatown Wars for Nintendo DS.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two has suggested it could bring more games to Switch 2, but it's unknown if GTA 6 could be among them. CEO Strauss Zelnick previously said Take-Two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">"would not necessarily bring every title to the platform,"</a> but he noted there is a "great" opportunity to bring some of its older titles to Switch 2. He also said he is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">"big believer" in the Switch 2.</a></p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to launch this year before it was delayed to May 2026 and then again to November 2026. The delays were no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">Rockstar always delays its games.</a> The game has an enormous amount of hype behind it and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">projected to sell many millions of copies,</a> but people looking to GTA 6 to help save the gaming industry amid its current struggles might be in for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">rude awakening. </a></p>

                <p>Ghost of Yotei has a unique feature that allows players to press a button to travel back in time to see what main character Atsu was doing many years prior. This is available at specific places in the game world, but the original plan at Sucker Punch was to allow players to do this anywhere, any time.</p><p>Creative director Jason Connell said in a conversation with Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan that this feature was something he was "very excited about" when it was originally pitched years ago. He said the appeal was that players could be at one moment experiencing Atsu's story in the main timeline when things are dark and bleak and she's on her lone wolf quest, and the next they could travel back in time and feel the "warmth of her past" and understand what she's fighting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKJWi6Pagmw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1552">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKJWi6Pagmw?start=1552" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"It started off as, 'Let's do that as many places we can, maybe everywhere,'" Connell said. "Like, can we do this as like a, like a stake-in-the-ground game feature?"</p><p>However, after about a year of working on this, and with the understanding that it would require double the art, Sucker Punch had to scale it back and only have this feature available in certain areas of the game. "So while it's this amazing feature, it saddened me the day that I had to to kill that and narrow it. But in the end, it was the right choice," he said.</p><p>Connell said the decision to narrow the feature came after feedback from testers and in discussions with colleagues. While Connell said he feels confident it was the right call, it was still "hard" for him.</p><p>He added that, had the feature been available across the entirety of the game, it ran the risk of feeling like a "gimmick" if Sucker Punch couldn't back it up with enough "meat" to make it worthwhile, narratively speaking.</p><p>Gilligan, for his part, said the situation could be like the delicate balance of salt on french fries.</p><p>"It's like salt on your french fries. There's nothing better than just the right amount of salt on your french fries.
