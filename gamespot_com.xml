                <p>Extraction shooters normally feature a grim and serious art direction, but Escape from Dukov is aiming to be a cute alternative to this genre when it officially launches on October 16. Waddling its way onto PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, the duck-themed single-player game has been fairly popular on Steam once a demo for it went live.</p><p>Billed as an extraction shooter that also features base-building gameplay mechanics, Escape from Dukov isn't a hardcore entry in the genre like Escape from Tarkov. The game has cartoonish enemies, fog-of-war mechanics, and randomly dropped loot, while the gameplay is flexible enough to allow you to fight enemies head-on or use stealth to your advantage.</p><p>When you're not planning for a run, you can also build up your base and store the resources you'll need to construct a spaceship that can be used to escape the doomed planet you're stuck on.</p><p>Like other shooter games, Escape from Duckov is all about the sweet allure of taking on enemies and scavenging for rare loot. If you're knocked out, you'll lose everything in this high-risk and high-reward game. Escape from Dukov also has weapon customization and a crafting system to add a level of replayability to the game.</p><p>If you're interested, Escape from Duckov has an early-adopter discount dropping the price down to $15.83 for the first two weeks post-launch, after which it will cost $18.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> won't officially launch until tomorrow, September 25, but PC users with early access have already released a handful of mods for the game. One of the mods even removes the franchise's signature fog from the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. And suddenly it's a much nicer day for high school student Hinako Shimizu, at least until something tries to kill her.</p><p>As demonstrated in the post above, the game isn't quite as intimidating if you can see everything clearly. Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake also had <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/videos/51" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mod that got rid of the fog</a>. Some of the other notable mods for Silent Hill f include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardware-based ray tracing</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removal of the HUD</a>, and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">optimization tweaks for the game's engine</a>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is a departure for the series and the first game in the franchise to be set in Japan. The story takes place in the '60s and follows Hinako as she tries to understand why her town has seemingly been swallowed in endless fog and populated by horrific creatures. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">review for Silent Hill f</a> gave it a 9 out of 10.</p><p>This game arrived less than a year after Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake. That title was so well-received that Konami and Bloober Team are joining forces again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. However, there's no release date set for that game yet.</p><p>Next year, the franchise will return to the big screen with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, a film that will adapt the story of Silent Hill 2. Original Silent Hill director and screenwriter Christophe Gans returned to helm this sequel, which stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, Hannah Emily Anderson as Mary, and Evie Templeton as Laura. Return to Silent Hill will hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>
