                <p dir="ltr">Street Fighter 6 characters, such as Ryu and Chun-Li, are coming to Call of Duty Mobile later this month. The crossover will be a part of the shooter's Season 11: 6th Anniversary, with Street Fighter operators arriving December 11, per the game's <a href="https://x.com/PlayCODMobile/status/1995191129025679642" rel="nofollow ">official X account</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no official roster of Street Fighter 6 operators announced for Call of Duty Mobile yet, but the trailer for the crossover--seen below--showcases Ryu, Chun-Li, Akuma, Cammy, and Luke. Additionally, a weapon series based on the fighting game is planned to drop December 13 for Call of Duty Mobile.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLK6ORbmUMM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qLK6ORbmUMM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Call of Duty Mobile has seen a big crossover event. In October, the game got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-season-9-midnight-rumble-lets-you-play-as-wwes-undertaker/1100-6535028/">WWE operators like the Undertaker and Alexa Bliss with Season 9: Midnight Rumble</a>. Even earlier this year, in July, the shooter featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-season-6-release-date-gundam/1100-6532732/">a Gundam-themed season</a>, and there was even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-next-crossover-is-one-we-did-not-expect/1100-6531860/">an unexpected Nier: Automata collaboration</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Mobile is also getting DMZ: Recon, which is an extraction mode, this month. For those unaware, the mobile game also has multiplayer, battle royale, and Zombies. The free-to-play shooter launched in 2019.

                <p>Rockstar Games co-founder and ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has given more opinions on artificial intelligence, claiming that we're not too far off from a future in which the controversial technology eats itself in some sort of ouroboros way that gives us mad cow (AI?) disease.</p><p>Speaking to Chris Evans (not the actor) for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4RTTcvFxJU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his Virgin Radio UK Breakfast Show on November 26</a> (as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/rockstar-co-founder-compares-ai-to-mad-cow-disease-and-says-the-execs-pushing-it-arent-fully-rounded-humans/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Houser was asked about his gaming origins, the founding of Rockstar Games and the creation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto/" data-ref-id="5000-1060">Grand Theft Auto</a>, and his new sci-fi thriller novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Better Paradise</a>. During the nearly 30-minute chat, Evans questioned Houser about the technodystopia he laid out in A Better Paradise and whether AI is as amazing as C-suite executives want us to think it is. Houser isn't fully convinced.</p>

<p>"I personally don't think it will because AI is going to eventually eat itself," Houser said. "As far as I understand it--which is really a superficial understanding--the models scour the internet for information, but the internet is going to get more and more full of information made by the models. So, it's sort of like when we fed cows with cows and got mad cow disease. I can't see how the information will get better if they're running out of data. [AI] will do some tasks brilliantly, but it's not going to do every task brilliantly, and it's going to become this sort of mirror of itself."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that Houser is possibly hinting at the "dead internet" theory, or the idea that the internet is largely made up of bots and AI-generated content engaging with and scraping itself. A <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au/newsroom/news/2024/05/-the-dead-internet-theory-makes-eerie-claims-about-an-ai-run-web-the-truth-is-more-sinister" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">May 2024 paper by the University of New South Wales</a> purports that the implications of this theory--and the evidence we're seeing with the proliferation of tools like chatbots and LLMs--suggest a more sinister undertone of politicking and profiteering.</p><p>Houser admitted that AI can "get you some information very quickly" if you ask it to perform specific tasks, but he noted that it's still "random and wrong a lot of the time." He also clarified that, particularly as an underscore to his novel, the "human element" can never be replaced by AI, no matter how hard billionaires want it to.</p><p>"Some of these people trying to define the future of humanity, creativity, or whatever it is using AI are not the most humane or creative people," Houser said. "So they're sort of saying, 'We're better at being human than you are,' and it's obviously not true. That's one of the other things we're trying to capture is that humanity is being pulled in a direction by a certain group of people who maybe aren't fully rounded humans."</p><p>Houser's latest AI criticism follows his previous comments about the controversial technology. While touring his novel, he said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">AI is overrated</a> and claimed the games industry is at a tough crossroads.</p><p>"[Gaming] can either go somewhere really interesting or somewhere that gets overly focused on making money," Houser said on a November 23 episode of Channel 4's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sunday Brunch</a>. "I think there's always that danger with any commercial art form that they get distracted by money. But I think there's still a big ceiling creatively to make these kind of living narrative experiences, and I think that was what we were always trying to do."</p><p>Dan Houser is no longer with Rockstar Games, but development continues at the studio on Grand Theft Auto 6. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">recently suffered a delay</a> to November 19, 2026, and has found itself at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">the center of controversy over the firing of staffers</a>.</p>

                <p>It should be of little surprise that Fortnite is still doing really well, with its new Hollywood-themed first season of Chapter 7 reportedly drawing in a peak of around 3 million concurrent players at its launch.</p><p>The reported figure comes from prolific Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1995264948205912437" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shiina</a>, who shared the number in an X post on Sunday. The new season, subtitled "Pacific Break," began Saturday, bringing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-7-map-for-season-1-all-map-changes/2900-7288/" data-ref-id="2900-7288">completely different battle royale map</a>, along with new weapons and a battle pass.</p><p>This comes off the tail end of the Chapter 6 "Zero Hour" finale, which attracted 10.5 million players in-game and over 3 million viewers through livestreaming, according to Epic Games. The publisher unironically shared the Martin Scorsese "cinema" meme in celebration of these figures.</p><p>For those who missed it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-boss-reveals-how-zero-hour-event-brought-together-the-ultimate-crossover/1100-6536588/" data-ref-id="1100-6536588">Zero Hour was a colossal crossover event</a> featuring an obscene number of IP, including Godzilla, Homer Simpson, King Kong, and the Power Rangers--almost enough to make Ready Player One look timid in comparison.</p><p>While these figures are undoubtedly impressive for any modern online video game, Fortnite is still falling short of its own all-time records. Attractions like The Simpsons mini-season lead to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">boosts in player count</a>, but even the massive Zero Hour event had a lower player-count than last year's record shattering Remix Finale, which featured the likes of Eminem and Snoop Dogg--that event pulled in 14 million concurrent players.</p><p>Even still, most online games would be happy to have the numbers that Fortnite currently has. There are still plenty of reasons to jump (or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7-season-1/2900-7289/#4" data-ref-id="2900-7289">surf, in the case of this season</a>) into the battle royale, including the chance to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-made-quentin-tarantinos-long-awaited-unfinished-chapter-a-reality/1100-6536522/" data-ref-id="1100-6536522">long-lost chapter of Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill</a>, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/players-think-theyve-found-ai-use-in-fortnite-chapter-7-but-artist-shows-its-not-cut-and-dried/1100-6536597/" data-ref-id="1100-6536597">accusations of AI-generated content</a> in Chapter 7 have also been levied against Epic.</p>
