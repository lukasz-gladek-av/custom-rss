                <p>Earlier this year, Capcom revealed that the 2023 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/" data-ref-id="1900-6418047">Resident Evil 4 remake</a> hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-4-remake-reaches-big-new-sales-milestone/1100-6528655/" data-ref-id="1100-6528655">9 million in sales</a> by the end of 2024. Now, Capcom has released a new video celebrating the game reaching the 10 million milestone. But some fans are wondering if the clip is also including a subtle reference to Resident Evil 9.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/dev1_official/status/1915602576843972712" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">エージェントの皆様へ<br>感謝の気持ちを込めて記念映像をご用意いたしました。ぜひ音付きでお楽しみください。<br>Attention all agents,<br>We've prepared a special video to express our gratitude to all of you, which we hope you'll enjoy (with sound ON)!<br>RE4 Dev Team <a href="https://t.co/cKaS198UVY" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cKaS198UVY</a></p>  — Capcom Dev 1 (@dev1_official) <a href="https://twitter.com/dev1_official/status/1915602576843972712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The video repurposes some footage from the RE4 remake, including the humorous touch of giving the villagers party hats as they shuffle away from Leon. But as noted on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-teased-by-capcom-in-new-re4-video/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, the thank-you messages from Capcom at the end of the video look like a Roman numeral IX turned sideways.</p><p>Capcom has previously confirmed that there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-confirms-new-resident-evil-game-is-in-development-with-resident-evil-7-director/1100-6524638/" data-ref-id="1100-6524638">a new Resident Evil game in development</a>, but has yet to publically call it Resident Evil 9. A previous report also suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-could-be-an-open-world-game-report/1100-6522123/" data-ref-id="1100-6522123">RE9 may be an open-world game</a>, which would be a first for the franchise.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom has committed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-is-remaking-more-resident-evil-games/1100-6519619/" data-ref-id="1100-6519619">remaking more Resident Evil games</a> after the remakes for RE2, RE3, and RE4 were all well-received. However, it's unclear which title is next in line for a modern remake.</p><p>The franchise is also poised for a big-screen comeback with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-says/1100-6530510/" data-ref-id="1100-6530510">a new Resident Evil movie</a> from Barbarian director Zach Cregger. That film will be released on September 18, 2026.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The TSA is well-known for its sometimes-questionable decision-making when it comes to what can and cannot fly. This week, one Call Of Duty fan found out the hard way that replica bombs are one of the many items that cannot be brought onto an aircraft… even if said replica looks more like a monkey than a bomb.</p><p dir="ltr">In a recent post on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1202998281489873&amp;id=100053391368777&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=5WvynoW1waY8WxDT#">the official Transport Security Administration Facebook page</a>, the TSA revealed it had confiscated a replica <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Monkey_Bomb" rel="nofollow ">Monkey Bomb</a> from a passenger at Boston Logan International Airport. The item in question is, of course, not a real bomb, but a replica of the amusing monkey-based grenade featured in a number of Call Of Duty titles, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482806" data-ratio="1.242209631728" data-width="706" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482806"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4482806-tsa.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"On today's episode of #ProhibitedItemsWeek, we present Call of Duty: Baggage Ops," the TSA shared on Facebook. "Our officers at Boston Logan International Airport (BOS) had a 'What the frag?!?' moment when they discovered this replica explosive device in a passenger's checked bag. This monkey may rack up points in a game, but in real life, leave the gear for your loadout screen, not your baggage. Replica weapons and explosives, no matter how cool or collectible, aren't allowed in either carry-on or checked baggage."</p><p dir="ltr">The replica in question appears to be the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Guys-Activision-Controller-xbox-one/dp/B08751LKZT" rel="nofollow ">Cable Guys Call Of Duty Monkey Accessory Holder</a>, which is meant to hold phones, console controllers, and other electronic accessories. But with three sticks of (clearly fake) C4 strapped to its back, the item apparently still counts as a "replica explosive," and is thus banned from both carry-on luggage <em>and</em> checked baggage. Anyone who wants to travel with their monkey-based replica explosive (and all other replica weapons) will have to mail those items to their final destination.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, it's not yet clear who the confiscated Monkey Bomb replica belongs to, but they're likely to be disappointed (and more than a little confused) when they arrive at their destination only to find that their beloved exploding monkey replica is mysteriously absent from their checked bag. (Interestingly, one <em>can</em> <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/transporting-firearms-and-ammunition" rel="nofollow ">travel with a real gun in their carry-on bag</a>, as long as they prepare the required paperwork.)</p><p>Alas, this is far from the strangest thing the Transport Security Administration has confiscated from passenger luggage. According to the TSA, <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/whatcanibring/items/peanut-butter" rel="nofollow ">peanut butter is technically a liquid</a>, and the agency frequently posts odd (and amusing) prohibited item finds on its <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tsa/" rel="nofollow ">Instagram page</a> as well as its Facebook page.</p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed a new piece of trivia about his PlayStation game Death Stranding. He said on a social media post that he offered Margaret Qualley a role in the video game after seeing her in a Kenzo perfume ad back in 2016.</p><p>The ad was directed by Oscar-winning director Spike Jonze (Being John Malkovich, Her), and in it, Qualley dances in a variety of contorting positions. "The only note I got from my agent was that they wanted me to dance like a tree," <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2017/05/how-margaret-qualley-auditioned-for-spike-jonzes-kenzo-ad.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Qualley said of the ad</a>, which you can see below.</p><p>In Death Stranding, Qualley plays Mama and Lockne. It's unclear if Qualley is coming back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. </a></p><p>Qualley's stardom has grown since 2019's Death Stranding, as she played one of the leads in the Oscar-nominated movie The Substance in 2024. She's also known for her roles in Quentin Tarantino's Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and the TV series Maid. Among her numerous upcoming projects is Happy Gilmore 2.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 launches at the end of June on PS5, with Kojima directing. Lately, Kojima has been busy <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1915711243488285041" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing the game ahead of release</a>. Kojima Productions recently held a media event where members of the press got a chance to play it, and impressions will be posted online this May. </p>
