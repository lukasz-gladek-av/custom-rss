                <p>Valve has trademarked the term Steam Frame, lending fuel to rumors that the company is planning to release a console counterpart to its popular handheld Steam Deck. No matter what form the Steam Frame takes, it looks like Valve is planning to expand its gaming hardware offerings in the near future.</p><p>Valve filed two separate trademarks for the Steam Frame on September 2, as spotted by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n7ojk1/steam_frame_trademarked_by_valve_computer_hardware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user</a>, with each covering a different use.

The Steam Deck, for reference, was listed under "handheld computers" and "computer hardware," among other related categories.</p>

<p>While the trademark filing doesn't have enough information to confirm anything, the industry rumor mill suggests Valve is working on multiple hardware projects including a Steam console codenamed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fremont</a>, a new SteamVR headset codenamed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-stream-deckard-standalone-vr-headset-rumor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deckard</a>, and new Steam controllers. The Valve Fremont <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently appeared</a> in a listing on benchmarking platform Geekbench, further fueling speculation around the project.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machines-first-impressions-the-specs-prices-/1100-6425734/" data-ref-id="1100-6425734">Steam Machine</a>, Valve's first foray into compact gaming hardware running the Linux-based SteamOS, was a flop, the company has had better luck with recent releases including the popular handheld Steam Deck. Many have speculated that Valve would return to console-like hardware for SteamOS after the Steam Deck's success, and recent news is making a console announcement look more likely.</p><p>As for what exactly the Steam Frame will be, the multiple trademarks suggest the branding could be intended to cover multiple upcoming hardware devices, as well as their related peripherals.</p>

                <p>Prior to this year, the release date for the Nintendo Switch 2 console was the subject of numerous rumors and speculative reports. The wait for fans officially ended in early June, but a new report states that Nintendo pushed back the Switch 2 launch multiple times despite the frustration of third-party companies.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, the reason Nintendo didn't rush Switch 2 to the market is because its designers requested extended deadlines for the launch titles in order to "perfect" them. Nintendo prioritized that above all other concerns, including the third-party publishers and fans who clamored for the console for years.</p><p>Earlier this summer, a separate report noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-dev-kits-still-sound-somewhat-rare-even-2-months-after-launch-report/1100-6534247/" data-ref-id="1100-6534247">Switch 2 development kits are still rare among third-party</a> companies even months after launch. It's believed that issue may be the reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/" data-ref-id="1100-6533186">why some Switch 2 third-party titles have yet to be officially announced</a>. Nintendo's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-developer-claims-that-sales-were-below-our-lowest-estimates/1100-6532572/" data-ref-id="1100-6532572">Switch 2 launch titles have also outsold the third-party games</a> for the console by a much higher ratio than expected.</p><p>Nintendo released a statement last month that said it regrets <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-regrets-the-inconvenience-of-switch-2-selling-out-all-the-time/1100-6533634/" data-ref-id="1100-6533634">the inconvenience caused by Switch 2's scarcity</a>. The company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 sold over 6 million units</a> by the first week of August, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">has reportedly moved 2 million consoles</a> in North America alone.</p><p>For now, Switch 2 is the only major modern console that hasn't been hit by a price hike over tariffs. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-get-more-expensive-in-2026-analyst-predicts/1100-6534130/" data-ref-id="1100-6534130">that may change in 2026</a>.</p>

                <p>After being announced six years ago, multiple delays, and years of anticipation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-and-time/1100-6534447/" data-ref-id="1100-6534447">releasing on September 4</a>. Now, on Silksong eve, a resurfaced Reddit thread about the original Hollow Knight is a great reminder of just how far the franchise and developer Team Cherry have come in the past decade.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3tj0p4/comment/cx6lr3t/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a>, posted by Reddit user crazy_loop 10 years ago, includes a trailer for the original Hollow Knight prior to its release in 2017 and features a heartfelt message.</p><p dir="ltr">"Last year my best friend quit his full-time job to chase his dream and make a fully fledged video game," the post reads. "Today he just released a trailer and it looks beyond amazing."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2025, a new trailer for Hollow Knight: Silksong would have set the internet ablaze, but back in 2015, the response was more muted, to say the least. Many players seemed indifferent.</p><p dir="ltr">The most upvoted response to the post stated that the game is probably "a fine game, but the market is currently saturated with side-scrolling platformers so I feel his game may not do as good as he hopes." Another user said the game looked fun, but they "hate to be raining on a parade" and continued that Hollow Knight looked to lack the "innovation and individuality of something like Limbo." They continued: "probably not going to be huge." Yet another said the game looked "cliche."</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a decade makes. There were definitely people in the Reddit thread who disagreed that the market was "saturated" with similar games and recognized that Hollow Knight could be something special. Some even expressed interest in buying it based on the trailer. Overall, however, the general consensus seemed to be that Hollow Knight looked fine, but might have a hard time finding an audience. Some said it might get a decent sales boost from appearing on Reddit's front page.</p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Hollow Knight has sold more than <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">15 million copies</a>, is breaking its all-time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">concurrent player peak on Steam</a>, and its sequel is such a big deal that numerous other games have announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">delays in order to avoid Silksong's release</a>. Not bad for the sequel to a small indie game that, judging from this Reddit thread, many expected to just be another drop in the metroidvania bucket.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite Hollow Knight's huge success and wild anticipation from fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Hollow Knight: Silksong will only cost $20</a>, $5 more than the original.
