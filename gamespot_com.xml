                <p>EA's College Football 25 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">one of 2024's best-selling games in the US</a>, but the game didn't deliver everything fans wanted. Now, EA has officially unveiled CFB 26 and discussed its new and improved features.</p><p>To begin with, CFB 26 has more than 2,700 new plays to choose from, while the roster of real college athletes in the game is in the "thousands," EA said. The student-athletes are being paid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-will-pay-student-athletes-1500-to-appear-in-cfb-26-more-that-double-last-years-rate/1100-6530192/" data-ref-id="1100-6530192">at least $1,500 to appear in the game</a>, which is more than double the rate from last year.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMGIfmAcNwA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMGIfmAcNwA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All 136 FBS schools are represented in CFB 26, while more than 300 real-world coaches have lent their likenesses to the game, which launches on July 10 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>CFB 26 also has expanded player types and abilities, including 84 total abilities and 10 new archetypes to help players customize their roster to their liking. Additionally, EA added a new "wear and tear" system that requires players to manage player fatigue and injuries.</p><p>The game also sports better AI, improved blocking and coverages, and a new "Dynamic Substitutions" system to help "show your opponent what your program is made of."</p><p dir="ltr">The Stadium Pulse system from CFB 25 has been "revamped" for CFB 26 to add new crowd-based challenges and things like "clock distortion" and "extreme screen shake" to help ramp up the intensity in pressure-packed moments. There are also 160 new school-specific chants in CFB 26, along with 10 new PA tracks--including "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.</p><p dir="ltr">The broadcast and commentary team from CFB 25 returns for the new game, including Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, and David Pollack.</p><p dir="ltr">EA also said fans can look forward to improved Dynasty and Road to Glory modes, while the Road to the College Football Playoff mode has a new online progression format.</p><p dir="ltr">CFB 26 launches July 10, but people who buy the game's deluxe edition or the EA Sports MVP Bundle--which includes CFB 26 and Madden NFL 26--can start playing on July 7. There will also be a free 10-hour trial for EA Play members, which means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Standard Edition of EA Sports College Football 26 features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-cover-features-two-top-wide-receivers/1100-6531832/" data-ref-id="1100-6531832">Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith</a>, two of the top-ranked wide receivers in the country.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorders-up-for-grabs-for-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">CFB 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sales numbers for CFB 25 were never announced, but EA said recently that the game drove <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $1 billion in "net bookings,"</a> which means revenue.

                <p>Subscription services for video games have grown over the years, but former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has expressed concern about them. In an interview, Yoshida spoke about how the expansion of first-party titles could eventually lead to third-party studios being shut out of subscription services, as the companies could prefer to hedge their bets with a growing library of first-party releases instead of experimental games.</p><p>"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions, that's really dangerous because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," Yoshida said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" rel="nofollow ">Game Developer at Gamescom LATAM</a>. "That's really, really risky because there must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</p>

<p>Yoshida added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases to its PlayStation Plus service after they've been on the market for a certain amount of time. Once sales have tailed off on a first-party game, it usually finds its way onto PS Plus, thus allowing more people to experience it for the first time.</p><p>In comparison, Microsoft's main selling point for Xbox Game Pass is that games developed by its internal studios are day-one releases on its subscription program, and third-party games have also been included in this strategy. So far, 2025 has seen day-one launches of big titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Doom: The Dark Ages, and South of Midnight on Xbox Game Pass. The releases have been fairly diverse as well, with games like Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush joining traditional fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Forza Motorsport.</p><p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">was also "immediately profitable,"</a> and the studio recently spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. At the same time, another developer has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/" data-ref-id="1100-6514084">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also clarified its own statements on the service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">potentially cannibalizing game sales</a>.</p><p>Yoshida did praise Microsoft for its backwards compatibility, a feat of engineering that he called "smart and very well planned" for its subscribers. PS Plus--and Xbox Game Pass--will be home to a day-one third-party release in June, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">Remedy Entertainment's FBC: Firebreak will be available through those services</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-may-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6587/">PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue was also updated this week</a> with a few more titles, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/">June's PS Plus games</a> includes a few recent titles from 2024 like the Alone in the Dark remake, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, and NBA 2K25.</p>

Trump attempted to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariffs, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a three-judge panel rejected this</a>. What all of this means for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and other gaming products, however, is unknown at the moment.</p><p>The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit, however.</p><p>The US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor Ilya Somin, who worked on a related tariff case, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/federal-court-strikes-down-trumps-april-2-tariffs-00373843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Politico</a>, "Anybody that has had to pay tariffs so far will be able to get them refunded."</p><p>The US Justice Department is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.</p><p>Nintendo cited Trump's tariffs as one of the reasons why Switch 2 preorders were initially delayed. While the Switch 2 price remains at $450, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some accessories.</a> Microsoft raised Xbox console prices, citing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">"market conditions,"</a> but without mentioning tariffs specifically. Sony, for its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/" data-ref-id="1100-6530829">raised PS5 prices in April.</a> Tabletop gaming companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-game-publisher-is-very-publicly-suing-trump-administration-over-tariffs/1100-6531040/" data-ref-id="1100-6531040">affected by the tariffs</a>, too.</p><p>Whether or not gaming companies were baking the tariffs into their price increases is unclear; also unclear is whether or not companies will offer refunds. </p><p>Gaming companies might raise prices for any number of reasons, beyond a potential impact of tariffs. For example, experts agree that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay more</a> for their favorite products because the data shows they will. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, adjusted for inflation, and Nintendo might be charging more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because people will pay it</a>.</p>

<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched earlier this month, and if you've already finished the Doom Slayer's prequel journey through Hell and a bizarre cosmic dimension, you don't have to stop ripping and/or tearing just yet. Bethesda and Kramer Guitars have partnered to create three guitars based on the game, and they're every bit as flashy and intense as the Slayer--but you'll have to be lucky to get one. </p><p>The three guitars, which appear to be functionally identical and sport different Doom-related visual designs, are classic Kramer, featuring a Floyd Rose bridge and a single humbucker. The brand was well known in the '80s for its shred-friendly axes, and the aesthetic certainly pairs well with a game as violent and over the top as Doom. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506"></a><figcaption>Glowing eyes not included</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg"></figure><p>"The unique designs were carefully applied with multiple layers of paint across several weeks, and each focus on one of the powerful weapons in your arsenal: the Atlan, Serrat the Dragon, and the Doom Slayer himself," reads the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/29/doom-kramer-guitars-giveaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official announcement</a>. They were created by illustrator Luke Preece, whose other work includes Gears of War: E-Day and art for bands like blink-182 and Metallica. </p><p>Now comes the bittersweet part: You can't buy these guitars. Instead, Xbox will be giving them away via its Instagram accounts, with residents from the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands eligible to win. Alongside the three guitars, you can win a copy of Doom: The Dark Ages, the game's collector's edition, or special-edition Xbox controllers. </p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a great addition to the legendary series, focusing on brutal counter-attacks and close-quarters chaos. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, Alessandro Barbosa called it "a finally tuned adventure that delivers the power fantasy of ripping and tearing through thousands of demons without losing an underlying complexity that makes each encounter engaging to blast through."
