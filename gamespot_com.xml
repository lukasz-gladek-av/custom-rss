The sequel was co-written by Druckmann and Halley Gross. The duo, alongside Craig Mazin, most recently penned the scripts for the final two episodes of The Last of Us Season 2 for HBO.</p><p>This will probably be a fascinating book to pore over and have by your side during your next playthrough. But it might be of even greater interest to aspiring game writers. Scripts, like many areas of game development, aren't talked about by developers or publishers. Unless you work in the industry, chances are you've never had access to a script for a AAA game until now.</p></div>                      </div><p>The fact that this book exists at all is honestly pretty remarkable--unprecedented, even. We couldn't find a single other full video game script in book format. The closest published example we thought of was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skyrim-Library-Volumes-III-Box/dp/1783293233?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Skyrim Library</a>, a three-volume series compiling all of the written lore found in The Elder Scrolls V.</p><p>The reality is that many AAA games simply wouldn't make sense to release in book format from a financial perspective. Games with choice-based dialogue trees, branching paths, open worlds, and hundreds of NPCs, and enormous lists of side content would simply require far too many pages across multiple books.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us series for PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png"></figure><p>The Last of Us, on the other hand, sets up particularly well for this format. No other game has been described as cinematic or referred to as an "interactive movie" as frequently as The Last of Us. Heck, many of the scenes in HBO's adaptation are pulled straight from the game, no interpretation required.</p><hr><p>The Last of Us doesn't have choice-based dialogue, branching paths, or a sprawling open world to explore. The gameplay experience in the first game is essentially scripted. The sequel is more dynamic, granting players more freedom to approach combat encounters and puzzles in different ways. But much like Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, the "open" set pieces are still fundamentally linear.</p><p>This doesn't mean that the scripts will read just like a screenplay or teleplay. There are still lots of interactive components to the worlds of each game that will naturally be found amidst conversations between Joel and Ellie. All of the text that fills the space between lines of dialogue should be illuminating. Chances are fans will glean new insights from the text.</p><p>Screenplays, which are typically 90-120 pages, aren't published nearly as often as they once were, but occasionally we see teleplay collections for popular TV shows. HBO's The Last of Us adaptation isn't one of them--at least not yet--but HBO has recent experience publishing scriptbooks for its shows.

                <p>In June, Capcom announced a second fan-art contest for Street Fighter 6, where artists could submit entries for a chance to have their art inserted into the game for use in the "Here Comes A New Challenger" screen. A winner was chosen for each of the 26 current roster members, but the winning entry for newcomer Kimberly has stirred up some controversy--namely, allegations that the artwork broke the contest's strict "no AI-generated images" policy.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-kimberly-ai-art-contest-lilithascends-1851786882" rel="nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, an X user named "hoodratt20xx" put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRuYXWbOATa7jxlopgSXwR41pEHKB14zA0oJYjCnPWYwjuzBSRpBOgAEFyLtGZoNdZqMJHDO6KOiWs3/pub" rel="nofollow ">comprehensive Google Doc</a> of what they think are telltale signs of AI use in the winning Kimberly entry as well as entries for other characters. Another X user, Galena_Bismon, shared a similar<a href="https://x.com/Galena_Bismon/status/1948190589461168219" rel="nofollow "> analysis</a> via a post on their feed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874"></a><figcaption>Kimberly from Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I have reason to believe that one of the winning entries for New Challengers 2 is partially or fully made with AI," hoodratt20xx wrote in the document. "I don’t make these accusations lightly and honestly would love to be proven wrong.

                <p>After similar pressure was placed on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> just last week, another storefront, Itch.io, has followed suit and culled the vast majority of its adult and sexual content. It cites the efforts of the organization Collective Shout, the same group that also went after Steam, as the primary reason for the removal of said games.</p><p>Rumblings of these removals picked up late on July 23, when creators started noticing that games with NSFW tags had been "shadowbanned" on the platform, while some others noted that their games had been entirely pulled. In the early hours of July 24, Itch.io shared a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> confirming the removals and clarifying the circumstances that led to the sweeping changes.</p><p>The statement begins, "We have 'deindexed' all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>It continues, "Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted in Itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on Itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and Itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."</p><p>In both situations, Collective Shout seemingly organized against the storefronts by pressuring their payment processors. Earlier this month, the group penned an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> to these companies accusing them of selling games with sexual-abuse material for profit.</p><p>Itch.io's statement suggests that the "situation developed rapidly" and that the company could not realistically have provided advanced notice to affected creators. It also goes on to say that the company is undergoing a "comprehensive audit of content" to make sure that the content on the store is in compliance with terms that will now be set by its payment processors. Moving forward, the pages that had been "deindexed" will remain as such throughout this audit and all future content tagged as NSFW on the platform will have to undergo further verification.</p><p>These changes come as a blow to Itch.io, which has developed a positive reputation among independent developers in recent years as a bastion for adult and queer content including games and zines. Additionally, the platform has famously implemented a "pay what you want" model that has enabled creators to make more profit and raise money for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-ice-in-california-bundle-raises-defense-funds-with-560-games-for-10/1100-6533022/" data-ref-id="1100-6533022">charity and humanitarian work</a>.</p><p>In response to Itch.io's sweeping changes though, many of its creators and loudest proponents are currently scrambling and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magicariot.com/post/3luoubs5gu22s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighing their futures</a> on the platform, as well as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organizing against payment processors</a> to push back on bans they feel are unfairly broad.</p>

<p dir="ltr">While the number of approved foreign games has increased in recent years due to the approval process now occurring monthly instead of every two months, there was a period from July 2021 to March 2022 when no new games were approved for release. Last month, China approved a record 158 new games for release--a multi-year high according to Chinese news outlet <a href="https://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/china-approves-158-new-game-licenses-in-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yicai Global</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big win for Blizzard, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-pc-titles-will-return-to-china-under-new-deal-with-netease/1100-6522533/" data-ref-id="1100-6522533">re-partnered with Chinese gaming giant NetEase in 2024</a> to re-release games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch 2 in China following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-and-netease-breakup-came-after-bobby-kotick-felt-threatened/1100-6512792/" data-ref-id="1100-6512792">licensing disagreements</a> that saw many Blizzard's titles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chinese-wow-servers-shut-down-after-14-years-following-expiration-of-netease-agreement/1100-6510829/" data-ref-id="1100-6510829">including WoW</a>, go offline in the region for most of 2023 and some of 2024. It was during this period when many Blizzard games were unplayable in China that Diablo 4 released globally in June 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard and NetEase have not yet announced an official release date for Diablo 4 in China, but when it does arrive, it will likely include a number of changes from the version the rest of the world plays. Previous Blizzard games in China have operated on their own separate, region-locked clients and servers and often receive region-exclusive events and cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">The Chinese versions of Blizzard games often bring various content changes in order to conform to Chinese government regulations. In the case of Diablo 4, that will likely mean less gore, fewer skeletons, and the removal of certain religious references. One thing is for certain, the Diablo 4 Necromancer and their skeletal minions will almost certainly look different in the Chinese version.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Diablo 4 news, Blizzard seems poised to bring big changes to its flagship ARPG, as content creators were recently treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse of the game's future</a>. As for everyone else, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-bring-big-permanent-changes-to-nightmare-dungeons/1100-6532690/" data-ref-id="1100-6532690">Diablo 4 Season 9 is currently ongoing</a>, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">new expansion slated to release next year</a>.</p>

                <p>Following Microsoft's latest mass layoffs that affected around 9,000 people--including dramatic cuts at Xbox--CEO Satya Nadella sent a memo to staff that was shared on <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's blog.</a> In the memo to staff, Nadella addressed what he called the "why, what, and how" of the decision to cut so many jobs.</p><p>Nadella said the decisions that led to the layoffs were "among the most difficult we have to make."</p><p>"I want to express my sincere gratitude to those who have left. Their contributions have shaped who we are as a company, helping build the foundation we stand on today. And for that, I am deeply grateful," he said.</p><p>Nadella also addressed what he called the "seeming incongruence" of how Microsoft made these dramatic cuts at a time when business is booming. Nadella said Microsoft is "thriving" by "every objective measure," but he chalked the layoffs up to "the enigma of success."</p><p>"Progress isn't linear. It's dynamic, sometimes dissonant, and always demanding. But it's also a new opportunity for us to shape, lead through, and have greater impact than ever before," he said.</p><p>Also in the memo, Nadella said when Bill Gates founded Microsoft decades ago, he did so with the belief that Microsoft could become a "software factory" that was "unconstrained by any single product or category." That idea is "no longer enough," Nadella said, adding that Microsoft needs to "reimagine" what its mission is. Microsoft is betting on AI, as it's investing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">$80 billion</a> into building out the technology and planning to bake AI into every product it makes, including Xbox.</p><p>"Just imagine if all 8 billion people could summon a researcher, an analyst, or a coding agent at their fingertips, not just to get information but use their expertise to get things done that benefit them. And consider how organizations, empowered with AI, could unlock entirely new levels of agility and innovation by transforming decision-making, streamlining operations, and enabling every team to achieve more together than ever before," Nadella said in his pitch for AI.</p><p>Going forward, Nadella said Microsoft will focus on three main areas: security, quality, and "AI transformation." For AI, Nadella said Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack," including the infrastructure, app platform, apps, and AI "agents."</p><p>"Our differentiation will come from how we bring these layers together to deliver end-to-end experiences and products, with the core ethos of a platform company that fosters ecosystem opportunity broadly. Getting both the product and platform right for the AI wave is our North Star," Nadella said.</p><p>Regarding company culture, Nadella said team structures are changing, and things could get messy. "It might feel messy at times, but transformation always is. Teams are reorganizing. Scopes are expanding. New opportunities are everywhere," he said.</p><p>The cuts at Xbox included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">layoffs, game cancellations, and the closure of at least one studio. </a>It was later reported that developers at the Microsoft-owned Candy Crush studio King said they were <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set to be replaced by the tools they helped build.</a> For its part, Microsoft has said it expects the rise of AI to lead to job losses in the near term, but that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">the opportunities that AI presents outweigh the challenges.</a></p>

                <p>One battle royale after another. After prolific <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">crossovers with Superman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, Fortnite appears to be gearing up for a collaboration with the film One Battle After Another. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio and written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, the upcoming thriller, slated for a September 26 theatrical release, isn't what anyone would consider fodder for Fortnite, making this crossover all the more intriguing.</p><p>The official Instagram account for the film put out a brief teaser, recreating a scene from the movie in which DiCaprio's character (replaced by Fortnite protagonist Jonesy in this teaser video) answers a covert call at a phone booth. "There are no hands on the clock. #OneBattleAfterAnother x Fortnite coming soon," the video's caption reads.</p><p>It's unclear what kind of content will come out of this collaboration, including whether it will take the form of skins based on the movie's characters or any missions given by NPCs on the battle royale map. Perhaps it'll be a Fortnite Creative experience with the purpose of promoting the film, but it's hard to imagine what that would look like.</p><p>One Battle After Another follows DiCaprio's character, an ex-revolutionary, reuniting with other fellow activists after an old enemy of theirs reemerges. The film also stars Sean Penn as the film's antagonist and Benicio del Toro, Regina Hall, and Teyana Taylor in supporting roles.</p><p>The possibility of playing as Leonardo DiCaprio or Sean Penn in Fortnite is pretty hysterical. Now it's hard not to imagine characters from Anderson's extensive filmography joining the fray-- picture Barry Egan from Punch-Drunk Love or Dirk Diggler from Boogie Nights wielding a pickaxe and running alongside a humanoid fish and a banana with limbs.</p><p>In the meantime, Fortnite studio Epic Games is still trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epics-plan-to-get-fortnite-back-on-ios-has-hit-a-snag-in-the-uk/1100-6533394/" data-ref-id="1100-6533394">get the title playable on iOS in the UK</a>. This comes after an extended legal battle that resulted in Fortnite's return to the US iOS App Store and the Epic Games Store in the EU iOS App Store.</p>
