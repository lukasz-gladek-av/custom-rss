                <p>Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-beer-includes-a-copy-of-the-game-if-youre-lucky/1100-6534578/" data-ref-id="1100-6534578">announcement of Borderlands 4 beer from Voodoo Ranger</a> comes another beer-related gaming announcement: Sapporo has created special <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost of Yotei</a> beer packaging to celebrate the game's upcoming launch.</p><p>Available in stores across the US now are new packaging materials for popular Sapporo varieties of cans and bottles. It's the same Sapporo beer, but in specially designed packaging to promote the game. And to that end, the packages come with a QR code that players can activate to unlock an in-game reward when Ghost of Yotei launches on October 2 for PS5.</p><p>The in-game reward is "The Charm of Hokkyokusei," which features Sapporo's famous star logo. Hokkyokusei is the Japanese term for the North Star, and this connects back to Sapporo lore, as <a href="https://www.sapporobeer.com/our-history" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's original brewmaster</a> was said to have followed the North Star to Germany where he learned how to make beer. In the game, using the charm gives players a "minor chance" to "not consume ranged weapon ammo when equipped," according to the <a href="https://mybeerbuzz.com/sapporo-and-ghost-of-yotei-limited-time-package-now-available/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announcement.</a></p><p>"Sapporo's original brewmaster and the hero in Ghost of Yotei both experience defiance, discovery, and artistry to re-write their fates. These are inspirational stories that connect us to Japan and its remarkable history. We aim to share those stories and bring fans closer to Japan through this partnership," Sapporo boss Zach Keeling said.</p><p>Sucker Punch boss Brian Fleming said when the team visited Japan for scouting trips, the developers knocked back "a few refreshing pints of Sapporo."</p><p>Sucker Punch's Andrew Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/garfep.bsky.social/post/3lyiwd66cck2u" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a social media post</a>, "We made one joke about a 'Yotei Six Pack' and a year later we have the perfect partnership. So happy this all came together," he said.</p><p>In other news, the Ghost of Yotei developers recently talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">how happy they were when GTA 6 was delayed to 2026</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">teased that the game may have more than one playable character.</a> It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delay-was-a-great-day-for-ghost-of-yotei-developers/1100-6534574/" data-ref-id="1100-6534574">Ghost of Yotei will reveal Atsu's butt.</a></p>

                <p>Canadian musician bbno$ is everywhere right now. Pronounced 'baby no money,' and definitely not 'bibinos,' he's collaborated with everyone from the VTuber Ironmouse through to producer Y2K. Several of his tracks have gone viral on social media platforms such as TikTok, including the likes of "Edamame" which was used in the trailer for The Garfield Movie, and "U Mad?" which appeared in CS:GO promotional materials. Now, we've spotted a possible reference to the singer-songwriter in none other than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4566162-screenshot2025-09-10193625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4566162" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4566162-screenshot2025-09-10193625.png" data-ref-id="1300-4566162"></a><figcaption>Baby No Money? Baby Yes Money!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4566162-screenshot2025-09-10193625.png"></figure><p>As part of the game's achievements and challenges, we spotted "Baby Yes Money," which rewards you for collecting increasing amounts of cash during your travels through Kairos. It's either a reference to bbno$ or an incredible coincidence, but with the musician's career going from strength to strength and his new album on the horizon, we prefer to believe it's the former.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will be released tomorrow, September 12. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a>, Jordan Ram√©e says the starting lineup of Vault Hunters is the best yet, but the "repetitive" enemy designs and "dull" side quests let the game down slightly.</p>
