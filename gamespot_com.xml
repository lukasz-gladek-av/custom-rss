                <p>Nintendo fans won't have to wait much longer to get their hands on the Switch 2. The successor to one of the best-selling video game consoles of all time is slated to release <strong>June 5</strong>, Nintendo announced during its hour-long livestream that fully lifted the veil on the Switch 2. You also don't have to wait much longer to preorder the Nintendo Switch 2, as Nintendo revealed that major retailers will open reservations online and in stores on <strong>April 9</strong>. The Nintendo Switch 2 will cost <strong>$450</strong> at launch. There will also be a bundle with a digital copy of the Switch 2-exclusive launch title Mario Kart World for $500.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch 2 Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Video game consoles typically don't come with preorder bonuses in the same way that games often do, but with Nintendo products, retailers often have exclusive bonuses. These range from practical products themed around Nintendo, such as tote bags and popcorn buckets, to display pieces and little trinkets. One unknown retailer is rumored to have a collectible coin for those who preorder the Switch 2. We will update this article as Switch 2 preorder bonuses are confirmed.</p><p>We expect that all major retailers who typically carry Nintendo hardware and first-party games will create placeholder pages for the Nintendo Switch 2 either today or in the coming days. <strong><a href="https://howl.link/mchk0rsl3pobe?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17370520340753?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a></strong>, for instance, has had a sign-up page on its site since Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2 in January. You can still sign up to receive notifications now, if interested. At <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a></strong>, the <em>actual </em>store page where you'll be able to order the Switch 2 is now live.

There's a chance, and perhaps a good one, that Amazon won't carry the Nintendo Switch 2 in general, or at least not at launch. Amazon is the only major retailer without a mention or Switch 2 banner on its site. When it comes to video games, the retailer's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Nintendo/page/BE0EB5D0-0AD6-4564-8BC5-4A129A3A9CFD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo store page</a> hasn't been updated in months.</p><p>For the past year, the relationship between Amazon and Nintendo has clearly been rocky. Amazon hasn't stocked the vast majority of first-party Nintendo Switch games, both new releases and hits from years past. Perhaps more telling is the fact that Amazon didn't carry the 2024 Nintendo Switch holiday bundles, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F9822067437%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyrule Edition Switch Lite</a>, or the recently released <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCONFIDENTIAL-885298%2F15177460250%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros.

Additional pairs of the new and improved Switch 2 Joy-Con Controllers will be available at launch. In the coming weeks, you can expect third-party accessory manufacturers to reveal new controllers, carrying cases, grips, screen protectors, and other accessories for Switch 2. Some third-party companies, such as the boundary-pushing manufacturer Dbrand, have been teasing Switch 2 accessories for months. Dbrand is creating a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15048490%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fdbrand.com%2Fshop%2Fgrip%2Fnintendo-switch-2-cases&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 version of its popular (and very good) Killswitch grip case</a>.</p><p><strong>You likely own a few "Switch 2" accessories already</strong></p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is also backward compatible with Switch accessories such as headsets and controllers--to an extent. For example, your Switch Joy-Con Controllers will work in docked mode with the Switch 2, but you can't connect them to the tablet for handheld mode. Accessories such as your Nintendo Switch carrying case are also unlikely to be compatible with Switch 2. But your <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller%2F55485228%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Pro Controller</a> and third-party gamepads such as the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller%2F55485228%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle%2F1100-6530531%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a>--our top pick for Nintendo Switch--will be compatible with Switch 2 from the jump.</p><p>Because of the sheer abundance of existing Switch accessories, there will likely be some interesting options to improve your Switch 2 experience at launch. The new Joy-Con don't appear to address one of the more common complaints about the default Switch 2 controllers: ergonomics. As such, grip cases and third-party alternatives for handheld mode will likely be popular this time around, too. Existing controllers like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameSir's G8 Plus</a> could be of interest, as this Bluetooth controller is compatible with Switch and tablets of up to 8.5 inches. It will certainly be able to cradle the Switch 2, and we'd be surprised if it isn't able to connect to the console.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-building-sets-get-nice-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6528603/">Lego Mario Kart Building Sets Get Nice Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pac-man-fans-can-preorder-shadow-labyrinth-secret-edition-for-only-60/1100-6528469/">Pac-Man Fans Can Preorder Shadow Labyrinth Secret Edition For Only $60</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-the-two-towers-4k-steelbook-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6527748/">Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers 4K Steelbook Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-sci-fi-and-fantasy-spring-book-sale-save-big-on-popular-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon Sci-Fi And Fantasy Spring Book Sale - Save Big On Popular Box Sets</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-sean-connery-4k-steelbook-collection-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6530389/">James Bond Sean Connery 4K Steelbook Collection Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-skywalker-saga-4k-box-set-featured-in-amazons-spring-sale/1100-6530379/">Star Wars Skywalker Saga 4K Box Set Featured In Amazon's Spring Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-controller-gets-nice-discount-a-month-after-its-release/1100-6529695/">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller Gets Nice Discount A Month After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-4k-blu-rays-box-sets-in-amazons-b2g1-free-big-spring-sale/1100-6530318/">Best 4K Blu-Rays &amp; Box Sets In Amazon's B2G1 Free Big Spring Sale</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Launching on June 5 alongside Switch 2, it includes several new buttons--including a C button to launch GameChat and two back buttons.</p><p>Beyond the inclusion of new buttons, you'll also find a headphone jack--a notable omission on the current Switch Pro controller. Beyond that, it looks to share many of the same features. Nintendo is yet to confirm all its specifications, but we'd expect gyro controls and rumble to make a return. It's unclear if Hall Effect or TMR sensors are used for the joysticks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469312" data-ratio="0.59393063583815" data-width="692" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469312"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469312-screenshot_2025-04-02_at_9.36.22.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469313,1300-4469314" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469313-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.38%E2%80%AFam.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4469314-screenshot2025-04-02at9.36.29%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>As far as looks are concerned, it's quite similar to the standard Switch Pro Controller. Featuring offset analog sticks, a D-pad, four face buttons, and four bumpers on the top of the gamepad, it looks remarkably similar to its predecessor.</p><p>The Joy-Con are also getting some new functionality, including not just a C button, but also the ability to function as a mouse for supported games. They also have larger buttons that should make it easier to use them when sharing with a friend.</p><p>Expect to hear more about Switch 2 Pro Controller pricing and hardware details at a later date.

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new 3v3 sports title: Drag x Drive. Releasing exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2, Drag x Drive will put your hoop-shooting skills--and the Joy-Con 2's mouse controls--to the test.</p><p>Revealed as a part of April's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2 direct</a>, Drag x Drive sees you take control of your own wheelchair-wielding athlete in an intense game of something kinda-sorta resembling basketball. In order to move around and pull off maneuvers, players will have to use the new console's mouse controls, then take aim and lift the Joy-Con 2 into the air to shoot for the basket.</p><p>Drag x Drive's release date has yet to be announced.</p>

I give you my life. Turn, oh wheel, and transport him to a night of moonlight, to humanity's very dusk." This could be interpreted as the method of humanity turning into a vampiric state.</p><p>Next, several different scenic cuts were shown before a silver-haired man stands atop a tall building surveying a city, a dark-haired man draws a sword-like blade, and a woman wearing traditional Japanese attire poses. A short creature clad in armor wades through a dark pool, before launching a jetpack to quickly cross a canyon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469325"></a><figcaption>There are a variety of weapon types in The Duskbloods</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469325-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-24-40screenshot.png"></figure><p>Characters appear to be able to hover in midair for short periods of time, and the silver-haired character is seen biting the neck of an enemy, lending further credibility to the vampire-like-creature theory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4469326"></a><figcaption>Many weird enemies await in The Duskbloods</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4469326-nintendodirect_nintendoswitch2%E2%80%934.2.20251-23-59screenshot.png"></figure><p>While there is an element of history in the scenes shown, vehicles including trains and weapons including guns suggest The Duskbloods timeline is set more recently than Elden Ring's 5,000 years ago.
