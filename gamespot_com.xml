                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>
