                <p>EA has announced the official date for the early-access release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/">Skate</a>, which will start on September 16 for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players.</p><p>Fifteen years have passed since the release of the last game in the Skate series, 2010's Skate 3. After a lengthy hiatus, EA originally announced the Skate reboot back in 2021, this time as a free-to-play live-service game designed to attract both series veterans and newcomers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p14MSdRtNIo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/p14MSdRtNIo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While details on Skate remained under wraps during its early development period, the last year has seen a trickle of new information released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/">and at least one memorable promo</a> featuring skateboarder and I Think You Should Leave star Tim Robinson. What we do know is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/">Skate will be an always-online game</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-somehow-has-microtransactions-before-it-even-hits-early-access-report/1100-6530068/">supported by microtransactions</a>, and in terms of gameplay, players can pull off some impressive tricks using the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-dev-explains-new-flick-it-system-and-its-ever-changing-city/1100-6524008/">redesigned Flick-it system</a>. The game will also feature a new approach to soundtracks and lots of customization options.</p><p>Skate is kick-flipping its way back into gaming at a time when skateboarding games have experienced a resurgence. Over the last couple of years, we've seen spiritual successors to Skate like Skater XL and Session: Skate Sim, while the franchise's biggest rival, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/" data-ref-id="1900-6418379">returned this year with a remake of the THPS 3 and 4 games</a>.</p><p>Additionally, we've also seen several well-received projects from the indie side of game development--like the OlliOlli series from the now-shuttered Roll7 and The Ramp--help to herald in the current era of skateboarding games.</p>

                <p>Every item in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/">Peak</a> serves an important purpose. Some are vital survival tools, aiding your injuries or keeping your tummy full to keep you climbing for longer. Others can jeopardize an entire expedition in an instant. Depending on who you're playing with, the latter can be dangerous--there's always that one player who won't hesitate to create a TikTok-worthy moment.</p><p>Here's the trick with items in Peak: While the game tells you its name, it doesn't actually explain what an item does. Some are easy enough to guess from looks alone, but more often than not, you should be wary of using something to avoid being penalized or affecting the run by accident. Don't fret, though--if you're wondering what things like the <strong>strange gem</strong> or the <strong>crystal skull</strong> do, the list below includes <strong>every item in Peak and what they do</strong>, so you can have a helpful page at hand to dispel doubts in the group chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4554843-20250628031112_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554843"></a><figcaption>I'm sorry, Bing Bong.

There have been quite a few smaller patches, but by and large, here are all the items available thus far. Note that we're skipping most of the food, as their purpose is largely self-explanatory.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Item</th><th scope="col">What it does</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Ancient Effigy</td><td>Revives any dead player or players.</td></tr><tr><td>Ancient Idol</td><td>You gain invulnerability to everything... as long as you hold it, that is.</td></tr><tr><td>Antidote</td><td>Cures poison partially</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Cannon</td><td>When shot at a surface, it releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead, starting from the point of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Anti-rope Spool</td><td>It releases a rope that "falls" upwards instead.</td></tr><tr><td>Backpack</td><td>It can carry up to four items</td></tr><tr><td>Bandages</td><td>Restores health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>Berrynana</td><td>You can throw it on the ground to cause other people to fall.</td></tr><tr><td>Big Lollipop</td><td>Grants infinite stamina for about seven seconds, and inflicts the drowsy status immediately after.</td></tr><tr><td>Bing Bong</td><td>Basically just a cute plushie, and part of a tough achievement that involves finishing a run while carrying it, in a similar fashion to Gnome Chompski in Left 4 Dead 2.</td></tr><tr><td>Binoculars</td><td>No abnormal effect here. They're just binoculars.</td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>Shoots a dart that clears negative status except for the curse status. The player who receives the shot will be temporarily drowsy.</td></tr><tr><td>Bounce Fungus</td><td>Creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, making for a good spot to rest while climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle</td><td>Plays a song, or heinous sounds, depending on your taste. If you use it around the capybaras in Alpine, you'll get an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Bugle of Friendship</td><td>Boosts everybody's stamina momentarily.</td></tr><tr><td>Cactus</td><td>It does nothing, but beware of its thorns if you throw it around.</td></tr><tr><td>Chain Launcher</td><td>Shoots a chain to the spot you're aiming at. Be mindful of your current stamina before committing to it.</td></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>Points north, which matches the peak of the mountain.</td></tr><tr><td>Conch</td><td>It does nothing. You can throw it at your friends if you want, though.</td></tr><tr><td>Cure-All</td><td>Cures all negative statuses.</td></tr><tr><td>Cursed Skull</td><td>Heals allies at the expense of your own health.</td></tr><tr><td>Dynamite</td><td>Causes an explosion, which can also cook items.</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Drink</td><td>Increases speed momentarily while inflicting the drowsy status afterward.</td></tr><tr><td>Faerie Lantern</td><td>Gets rid of all negative statuses. It doesn't help with hunger.</td></tr><tr><td>First Aid Kit</td><td>If injured, it restores all of your health, while also curing poison.</td></tr><tr><td>Flare</td><td>This emits a big smoke cloud that alerts others of your location. It's also used at the peak to call the helicopter.</td></tr><tr><td>Flying Disk</td><td>You can just have some fun with this.</td></tr><tr><td>Heat Pack</td><td>When used, it gradually removes cold for some time. Useful for blizzards in the Alpine biome.</td></tr><tr><td>Lantern</td><td>Emits light, and its heat also removes cold gradually.</td></tr><tr><td>Magic Bean</td><td>It summons a beanstalk, which is great for climbing.</td></tr><tr><td>Pandora's Lunchbox</td><td>It removes all negative effects upon use, but you also get a random assortment of new effects, which can be either positive or negative. Thanks, Pandora.</td></tr><tr><td>Parasol</td><td>Along with protecting you from the sun, you can use it for gliding.</td></tr><tr><td>Pirate's Compass</td><td>Points toward suitcases nearby.</td></tr><tr><td>Piton</td><td>Adds a piton on any suitable surface that you can grab onto to restore stamina.</td></tr><tr><td>Portable Stove</td><td>Useful for cooking items and reducing cold.</td></tr><tr><td>Remedy Fungus</td><td>It creates a healing mist when thrown against the ground. If you're playing with others, make sure you're all gathered together first.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Cannon</td><td>Shoots a harpoon to where you're aiming, which releases a rope in the place of impact.</td></tr><tr><td>Rope Spool</td><td>Releases a rope. You can adjust the height and, once ready, press the action button again to anchor it to the surface you're standing on so it stays in place.</td></tr><tr><td>Torch</td><td>A great source of light, albeit limited.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Cannon</td><td>You can shoot yourself from a long distance with it.</td></tr><tr><td>Scout Efficy</td><td>Revives another player. If more than one player is dead, the item picks one at random.</td></tr><tr><td>Scoutmaster's Bugle</td><td>If you're playing solo, using this rare bugle summons the Scoutmaster. Useful for an achievement.</td></tr><tr><td>Scroll</td><td>There's a chance of seeing them at the summit of biomes. You can use them to create Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Shelf Fungus</td><td>It creates a mushroom platform when thrown at a surface, great for climbing or to provide an extra platform when attempting long jumps.</td></tr><tr><td>Strange Gem</td><td>It does nothing. At least for now.</td></tr><tr><td>Torn Page</td><td>Mostly for an achievement, which tasks you with collecting eight Torn Pages.</td></tr><tr><td>Weird Shroom</td><td>No weird side effects, it just restores your health partially.</td></tr><tr><td>More to come at some point</td><td>There'll likely be more items added in the future.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>That's all the items available in Peak at the time of writing. Have fun climbing!</p>

                <p>Helldivers 2 is having a big day. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">launched today, August 26, on Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it also got a big new update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">including a Halo crossover</a>. All of the excitement has led to a surge in players and sales for Helldivers 2--here are some of the key things to know about Helldivers 2's latest success.</p><h2><strong>No. 1 on Steam</strong></h2><p>On Steam, Helldivers 2 is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top-selling game overall in the US based on revenue</a>. Helldivers 2 is also No. 2 in the UK. Filtered by global stats, Helldivers 2 is No. 2, only behind Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>In terms of player numbers on Steam, Helldivers 2 reached more than 114,000 peak concurrent players today, August 26, meaning the game is inside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's top 10 overall most-played games.</a> This is the highest figure since June.</p><p>Across all platforms, Helldivers 2 has reached more than 200,000 players today, <a href="https://x.com/TheColeBrewTv/status/1960346775736459287" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to the game's own data.</a> Specific player-number data for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, however, is unknown.</p><h2><strong>Mysterious new patch</strong></h2><p>Helldivers 2 got a new update today, but the patch notes have not been posted. As such, people are theorizing that the update is hiding things that the developer wants players to discover organically. The lack of patch notes has <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1960264615679390163" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inspired some memes.</a> The studio also announced more upcoming Helldivers 2 content, including<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952"> Into the Unjust</a>, which launches on September 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXeRkqH2Gos" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qXeRkqH2Gos" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>Launch party and an Xbox button</strong></h2><p>Developer Arrowhead Studios held a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1960250153467531332/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launch party for Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a> and the studio also had a dedicated Xbox button that the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt ceremoniously pressed to launch the game.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is one of PlayStation's first releases on Xbox. The MLB The Show series is now on Xbox, but it's co-published with Major League Baseball. Also released today was Gears of War: Reloaded for PlayStation 5, meaning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">PlayStation and Xbox swapped former console exclusives today.</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/">Baby Steps</a>, the hilariously awkward walking simulator from Devolver Digital, has taken a more cautious step back. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">In the looming shadow of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, the team announced a new release date for September 23. However, the developers released a fun new video of Nate, the game's perpetually off-balance, onesie-clad walker, attempting (and failing) to climb a massive statue of Hornet, the star of Silksong.</p><p>This isn't the first game to quietly adjust its footing in the wake of Silksong's long-awaited launch and an increasingly packed fall release schedule. Demonschool, another upcoming indie title from publisher Ysbryd Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/" data-ref-id="1100-6534245">has recently pushed its release to November, retreating from its original September 3 launch date.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Behind Baby Steps' slapstick charm is an all-star indie dev trio: Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch. Together, they've crafted a seemingly absurd yet oddly touching game about Nate, an unmotivated basement-dweller who discovers his one true gift: walking. One foot at a time, players guide Nate through a mysterious, scenic world using physics-driven controls that transform every hill into a mountain and every step into a monumental achievement.</p><p>With its new release date giving it some breathing room, Baby Steps now has a chance to shine on its own. Players will now help Nate lurch and flop through a surprisingly emotional journey filled with awkward encounters and scenic landscapes on September 23, on PC and PS5.</p>
