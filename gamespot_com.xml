Streamer Breebunn showed during this extremely long stream creating her characters for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which took an astonishing 21 hours.</p><p>The streamer created an elf Inquisitor named Mellon, rocking a high ash blonde ponytail, and her elf mage Rook wears a smidge of lipstick for a pop of color.

Dragon Age playtime clock hovering around that displayed 21 hours and 20 minutes, and she hadn't even started playing the actual game at the time.

                <p>An upcoming indie game inspired by action films like The Raid looks to deliver on the brutal hand-to-hand combat the film is known for. It may even invoke some comparisons 2012's underappreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleeping-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-61973">Sleeping Dogs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/acts-of-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-631942">Acts of Blood</a>, and though it doesn't yet have a release date, it did recently receive a free demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3031890/Acts_of_Blood/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> that lets players fight their way through a portion of its main story. Players step into the shoes of an Indonesian college student named Hendra, who is seeking revenge after his father is murdered by a business rival. When the government's corrupt legal system protects the killers, Hendra takes justice into his own hands and looks to make them pay for their crimes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBC1PT6UrJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gBC1PT6UrJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A look at Acts of Blood's gameplay shows off its quick and bloody melee combat, with Hendra able to swiftly swap from punches and kicks to wielding melee weapons like bats, knives, hammers, and machetes. There are firearms as well, though the emphasis looks to be on the brutally efficient hand-to-hand combat. The environment plays a big role in combat too, with Kendra able to use parkour to run, slide, and climb through levels, as well as ustilize destructible objects in the environment as weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Eksil Team, the developer behind the game, isn't shying away from the brutality of it all. In the game's mature content description on Steam, Eksil Team states the game includes blood, gore, and dismemberment, and that the violence is "frequent and integral to the gameplay experience, with detailed and realistic portrayals of combat injuries."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/VoyagersRevenge/status/1853604780247265500" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This new Beat ‘em up game inspired by The Raid films combines 3rd person action with fast-paced martial arts, and brutal hand-to-hand combat. Acts of Blood demo is available on steam now <a href="https://t.co/nO3rWEdgWc" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/nO3rWEdgWc</a></p>  — 𝗩𝗢𝗬𝗔𝗚𝗘𝗥𝗦 𝗥𝗘𝗩𝗘𝗡𝗚𝗘 (@VoyagersRevenge) <a href="https://twitter.com/VoyagersRevenge/status/1853604780247265500?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Acts of Blood wears its The Raid inspiration, a 2011 film known for its bloody and bone-crunching fights, on its sleeve. If that wasn't clear from the blood-soaked fights, The Raid and its sequel, as well as Acts of Blood, all take place in Indonesia. But its focus on melee combat also brings to mind Square-Enix's Sleeping Dogs, another hand-to-hand combat-heavy action title known for its over-the-top environmental kills that was in turn inspired by Hong Kong action films. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a>, a more recent beat-'em-up title, is another game Acts of Blood looks to be inspired by, though the 2022 game (despite its Mature rating) is far less blood-soaked than Acts of Blood.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to playing through some of its story, the Acts of Blood demo includes an arena mode so players can fine-tune their combat skills, as well as outfit customization that lets players tailor Hendra's look. Acts of Blood can currently be wishlisted on Steam.</p>

This new season includes the brand-new Anniversary battle pass with both free and premium items, including new operator skins, weapon blueprints, CoD Points, and various cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Highlights of the free battle-pass tiers include Season 10's new USS 9 submachine gun, and the new battle-royale class called Teleport, which lets the user place a beacon on the ground that they can then teleport to from any point on the map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394733" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394733"></a><figcaption>USS 9 submachine gun</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394733-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-010.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Premium battle pass tiers include additional cosmetics, such as operator skins for Synaptic, Girasol, Polina, and Francis. It also has a couple of weapon blueprints, including "The Lovers" blueprint for the new USS 9 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest update for Season 10 is the new battle royale map. Krai is described as a mid-sized map with five main points of interest. Matches on Krai will give each operator one respawn, and after that, eliminated players will drop a scannable dog tag. If their squad can reach it and scan it, the player can return to the match.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394736" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394736"></a><figcaption>Krai battle royale map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4394736-codm-s10-5th-anniversary-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The map will also include a mode for a narrative-style mission. Activision says players can "embark on a special mission" as Urban Tracker and Kumo-chan to explore Krai's Sanatorium for insight into the map's secret history. They'll follow clues and engage in combat alongside a robot companion. This includes engaging in minigames during the mission, and players can find similar minigames in regular matches on Krai, which can provide "unique and powerful" in-match weapons or rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to unique events tied to the new map, there are also a variety of minigames, Anniversary events, login events, and other ways to earn free gear in the Challenge HQ. One of the events is called Mail Call, which tasks players with collecting letters from the developers to earn rewards. These events can grant weapon XP, operator skins, weapon blueprints, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">As always with seasonal updates, players can expect additional content and quality-of-life improvements with Season 10, as well as new seasonal challenges, store bundles, Keep updates, and more.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is gearing up for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-start-date-and-details/1100-6527587/">Season 1 on November 14</a>, which brings more multiplayer maps, new Zombies content, and Warzone integration.</p>

                <p>Following the huge success of Hogwarts Legacy--it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/#6" data-ref-id="2900-4951">2023's best-selling game in the US and sold more than 30 million copies globally</a>--Warner Bros. Games is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">making a sequel</a>. New details about the game and WBIE's plans overall for gaming have now emerged.</p><p>WB Games president David Haddad told <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/harry-potter-franchise-future-tv-series-video-games-1236201249/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that Hogwarts Legacy 2, or whatever the game is called, could connect to the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/harry-potter-tv-show-max-release-date-cast-story/2900-5266/" data-ref-id="2900-5266">Harry Potter TV series</a> in some way. It remains to be seen how this would come to be, however. Hogwarts Legacy was set in the 1890s whereas the TV series is understood to be a re-telling of the Harry Potter books, which take place in the 1990s.</p><p>Whatever the case, Haddad said, "We have known for some time that fans are looking for more things in this world, and so we're spending a lot of time thinking about that." He added: "Our insights tell us that there are not huge distinctions between a younger version of a fan and an older version of a fan. They're just deep Harry Potter fans, and we try to build authentic experiences to delight them."</p><p>The executive went on to say that the huge success of Hogwarts Legacy gave the wider company confidence that continuing to invest in the Harry Potter series was a good decision.</p><p>"The rest of the company was very curious about what we helped to unlock with Hogwarts Legacy last year," he said.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy was such a big success that it even outsold Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III in the US during 2023.</p><p>Also in the interview, Warner Bros. Discovery boss Robert Oberschelp clarified author J.K. Rowling's involvement in the Harry Potter series going forward. He said she is not directly involved, but that executives keep her in the loop by way of her agent if WBD's teams want to go "beyond a canon conversation." Rowling's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">comments about the trans community</a> continue to hang over the magical series.</p><p>In addition to Hogwarts Legacy 2, Warner Bros. is reportedly producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-is-reportedly-in-the-works/1100-6527135/" data-ref-id="1100-6527135">Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition</a> featuring additional story content. Hogwarts Legacy released without the ability to take part in Quidditch matches, but a dedicated Quidditch game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions/" data-ref-id="5000-631815">Quidditch Champions</a>, released this September.</p><p>The Harry Potter movie series was massively popular in the early 2000s, and attempts were made to create a spin-off series called Fantastic Beasts. After three films, however, the series was put on hiatus. Star Jude Law, who plays a young Albus Dumbledore in the series, recently said <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/fantastic-beasts-franchise-dead-jude-law-eddie-redmayne-1236193808/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the franchise may be over.</a></p><p>The TV series, meanwhile, is in the works for Max and is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-show-launches-open-casting-call-for-harry-hermione-and-ron/1100-6526370/" data-ref-id="1100-6526370">casting its three leads: Harry, Ron, and Hermione. </a></p><p>fantastic</p>
