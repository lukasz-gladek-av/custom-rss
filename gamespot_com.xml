                <p>If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator.</p><p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer "uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us." The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action" against the creator of the trailer.</p><p>The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales.</p><p>Following Suzuki's departure from Sega, Shenmue 3 was successfully crowdfunded and released in 2019. Earlier this year, Inin Games and Suzuki announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-and-coming-to-xbox-and-nintendo-consoles-for-the-first-time/1100-6534028/" data-ref-id="1100-6534028">Shenmue 3 Enhanced</a> will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo consoles. That version of the game will feature numerous visual upgrades including 4K texture uplift for the environments and characters. It will also feature increased density of NPC characters in the streets to make the game world feel more alive.</p><p>Last year, a group of dedicated Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">launched a campaign for Shenmue 4</a> by purchasing a Times Square ad in New York. It remains to be seen if that campaign will ultimately lead to the franchise getting a new sequel.</p>

Lyu explained that while the team always had faith in their Wuxia world, they weren't expecting this much success this quickly.</p>

<p>"We hoped it would find its audience, the players who would love the freedom and mystery we tried to create," Lyu said. "But [nine] million players in two weeks … that number has honestly blown all our internal expectations out of the water. The mood in the studio is hard to put into words. There's definitely pride and excitement--seeing years of hard work resonate with so many people is a feeling like no other. But what really hits us, more than anything, is the sense of responsibility."</p><p>Lyu continued, saying the nine million players exploring Everstone Studio's fictionalized 10th-century China aren't "just a metric" but "nine million individual journeys." Looking at the player count that way, he told FRVR that it's "incredibly motivating and incredibly humbling" for Where Winds Meet to be this popular.</p><p>"To put it simply, the overwhelming feeling is one of deep gratitude and a focused determination," Lyu said. "This incredible show of trust isn't the end goal; it's the fuel. It's what pushes us to keep improving and expanding this world for everyone. The journey has really just begun, and we're so grateful to have this amazing community with us."</p><p>Lyu also said that although Where Winds Meet's monetization may be somewhat ridiculous, the game will not become pay-to-win, and the team has no plans to pursue any other "aggressive" forms of monetization. The only things you can buy will forever be cosmetics, something Lyu believes gives Everstone Studio an advantage over other free-to-play games on the market.</p><p>“We must protect our greatest commercial advantage--which is offering an experience free from the constraints of pay-to-win mechanics," Lyu said."Therefore, with that as our guiding principle, we see no need to become aggressive or introduce statistical advantages in the future."</p><p>Where Winds Meet is still sitting comfortably on Steam's <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most-played games list</a> as of this writing, trailing just behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. With hundreds of thousands of players logging on at any time, Everstone Studio made it clear that if you cheat, you will get suspended; the developer <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997271025432834108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already took action against 5,000 accounts </a>for using software such as macros and speed hacking. That said, players are finding ways to circumvent the game's myriad systems, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-winds-meet-players-figure-out-how-to-trick-npcs-into-giving-up-loot/1100-6536571/" data-ref-id="1100-6536571">tricking the plethora of AI chatbot NPCs to cough up loot and quest items</a>.</p><p>Where Winds Meet is available now on PC and PS5. The open-world Wuxia RPG will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-winds-meet-will-officially-launch-on-mobile-this-month/1100-6536627/" data-ref-id="1100-6536627">make its global Android and iOS debut on December 12</a>, with Everstone Studio <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997337719257895205" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posting on X</a> that some five million people have already pre-registered their devices for its imminent release.</p>

GameStop said in a news release that it took in more than 80,000 trades across the US on December 6 alone, and people brought in lots of unexpected and usual items, including a taxidermied bobcat and goose, a speed limit sign, a Wii Netflix disc, a bowling ball, a tiny Jesus, and "a literal can of whoop-ass."</p><p>This was all done as a marketing campaign to raise awareness for GameStop's trade-in program. The retailer also noted that people brought in "a significant number" of canned food goods to support food banks and pet shelters.</p><p>One person attempted to trade in their dog (presumably as a joke, we hope!) but was <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997412308713402623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rejected.</a> Another person <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1997478744215466157" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">tried to trade in their Social Security card but GameStop said no.</a> Someone else brought in a copy of the Declaration of Independence, and GameStop seemingly accepted it.</p><p>The fine print of the Trade Anything promotion mentioned that people would be limited to one trade and a value of $5.

                <p>The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft</a> Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>, and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to "see" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers<a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Crelly </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian</a>, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcE_dHvaN2Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZcE_dHvaN2Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-to-the-end-in-minecraft/1100-6531635/" data-ref-id="1100-6531635">The End</a> to face off against the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625"> Ender Dragon</a>--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.</p><p>As if that didn't sound complex enough, Neuro has been making some interesting choices that have resulted in yet another world reset. Neuro often gets overwhelmed with bloodlust, seeking out mobs during the night and facing off against them with less than ideal strategies. She's not yet mastered the "hit and shield" approach of attacking mobs, so she'll repeatedly land weak attacks on them until they inevitably overcome her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQNHxSGrVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UcQNHxSGrVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside the usual Minecraft deaths--such as being blown up by Creepers, attacked by an Enderman, or falling into a lava pit--Neuro has seemingly decided to troll her creator and his friends. Clad entirely in enchanted diamond armor, the four set off for the Nether to find Blaze Rods--an ingredient essential for finding the portal to The End--where Neuro immediately began to build a bridge over a large lava lake. After taking an extended look back at the portal to the overworld, she spammed crouch and then walked off the end of the bridge and burned to death.</p><p>On another attempt, after becoming overwhelmed by that aforementioned bloodlust, Neuro slayed an innocent Villager. In Minecraft, if you damage a Villager in a village protected by an Iron Golem, that Golem will not take kindly to your actions. Neuro found this out the hard way, and in just two hits she was dead, and the run was over.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPyoaBEc5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xPyoaBEc5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the attempts progress, Crelly--who has become Neuro's "stepmother" and often entrusted with babysitting the AI--is becoming increasingly frustrated with Neuro's frequent mistakes. "She wants to die!" yelled the cow YouTuber after attempt number 74. "Neuro, Neuro, Neuro!" she shouts during attempt 80, when Neuro-Sama insisted upon digging upwards out of a safe area Crelly had created for her. "Neuro, that's an Enderman; let's not look at him. Follow me!" she adds. It's safe to say the trust in Neuro's Minecraft capabilities is rapidly depleting.</p><p>At the time of writing, the streamers are taking a sleep break after attempt number 83, and the stream has been live since Friday, December 5, at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM GMT. According to YouTube editor <a href="https://youtu.be/4xPyoaBEc5k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KeidenEdits</a>, Neuro has been responsible for 47 deaths, Filian for 14 deaths, Vedal for 13 deaths, and Crelly for 10 deaths. Of those statistics, 17 have been Zombies, 11 have been Creepers, and 11 have been Skeletons. Nine deaths have resulted from fall damage, eight from drowning, four from the Iron Golem, four from lava, Neuro has turned homicidal four times, the Drowned mob has committed two murders, two from Zombified Piglins, two from an Enderman, and one a piece for the Witch, Spider, Husk, and Guardian mobs. Neuro has starved to death once, Vedal has accidentally killed once, and Neuro has suffocated in sand once.</p><p>The four plan to resume their attempts today, December 8, at 8:30 AM PT / 11:30 AM ET / 4:30 PM GMT.</p>
