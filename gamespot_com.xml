                <p>More than a decade after its last release, Carmageddon is returning with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/carmageddon-rogue-shift/" data-ref-id="5000-705080">Carmageddon: Rogue Shift</a>. Developed by Redout studio 34BigThings, this spin-off casts players as a faceless driver in a world wrecked by war, disasters, and an inconvenient zombie apocalypse triggered by megacorporations.</p><p>Zombies--called the Wasted in this universe--overwhelm humans while players clash in deadly races for power, prestige, and a chance to escape the chaos by catching a rocket off Earth. While this sounds par for the Carmageddon course, the catch here is that Rogue Shift leans heavily into roguelite gameplay. Players drive through randomly generated paths and tackle events to seize upgrade credits, and even if you crash out, permanent bonuses unlocked with beatcoins grant you an edge for your next run.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFmSbChgC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mFmSbChgC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each run will require you to carefully plot your destination, as your ride will require repairs along the way. Difficulty also increases dynamically, but finding the right synergies between vehicles, perks, and weapons will help you build the ultimate killing machine that can be used against the Wasted hordes or other drivers roaming the streets.</p><p>34BigThings says there are 13 weapon classes and over 80 perks to choose from, and each of the 15 unlockable vehicles has unique handling characteristics related to their drivetrain, weight, center of mass, suspensions, tire friction, and pressure.</p><p>"We made Carmageddon: Rogue Shift to challenge you in a way that keeps you coming back. Our goal is to get you into that flow, firing-on-all-cylinders flow state we fondly remember from the original Carmageddon games and, more in general, the combat racing games that defined the genre," head of design Giuseppe Enrico Franchi wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/06/carmageddon-rogue-shift-new-gameplay-details-on-the-roguelike-racer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Carmageddon: Rogue Shift will launch in early 2026 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Arc Raiders was one of 2025's biggest success stories in gaming, and it's keeping up the momentum in 2026, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">January 4 becoming the game's biggest day ever in terms of daily users</a>. The game was originally going to be a free-to-play title, but it changed to $40 ahead of launch. Why $40? Embark Studios boss Patrick Soderlund said in an interview that the decision to switch from free to premium came after the team saw the success of Helldivers 2, which was also priced at $40.</p><p>"We basically looked at games like Helldivers and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" he told <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=NXyvhtFgKyZ2B6nb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-is-arc-raiders-cheaper-than-most-triple-a-games-thanks-to-helldivers-2-mostly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>). "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p><p>The executive added that $40 was the right price for Arc Raiders also because it helped the game avoid being an "offender" for players. The game has no campaign and is 100% multiplayer.</p><p>"We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be," he explained.</p><p>Arc Raiders has now reportedly sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">12 million copies across all platforms</a>, driving more than $350 million in revenue.</p><p>Arc Raiders and developer Embark are owned by South Korean game giant Nexon. The studio's previous game, The Finals, was not as successful, but it "laid the foundation for Arc Raiders' explosive success," a spokesperson for Nexon told <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10620485#:~:text=Nexon%20said%20the%20game's%20rapid,in%20annual%20sales%20by%202027." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Korea Herald.</a></p><p>Another high-profile game will adopt a $40 price as well, as Bungie will charge that rate for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-release-timing-and-price-announced/1100-6536971/" data-ref-id="1100-6536971">PvPvE shooter Marathon</a> when it launches in March.</p><p>Given the immense success of Arc Raiders, it's unsurprising to learn that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-received-movie-and-tv-offers/1100-6537191/" data-ref-id="1100-6537191">Hollywood has come calling</a>, inquiring about movie or TV show deals. None have materialized as of yet, however.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a big success, but it also has its critics who took issue with the game's use of artificial intelligence systems for its voice lines. Developer Embark <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/" data-ref-id="1100-6537166">recently defended the use of AI</a>, with Soderlund saying, "People have to take a step back and understand what it is and how it can be a big help to developers and be a tremendous benefit to players."</p>
