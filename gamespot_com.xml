                <p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games' Phasmophobia came from humble beginnings, with a single developer bringing to life their vision for casting players as paranormal investigators and then letting them loose to explore spooky environments and be terrorized by a variety of malevolent entities.</p><p dir="ltr">Its success was impressive and has even paved the way for other social-multiplayer games to achieve similar success. But now, Kinetic is preparing to take another big step forward. And although it has the attention of Hollywood, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/" data-ref-id="1100-6532047">with a big-screen adaptation now in the works in partnership with Blumhouse Productions</a>, the devs are staying focused on making sure its players have plenty to look forward to too.</p><p dir="ltr">We recently spoke to Daniel Knight and Asim Tanvir from Kinetic to discuss the success of the game, as well as what the future holds for it and the team.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="970250275"

the game now. And we're not doing the larger ones anymore. So, what unique small maps could we do? I'm not sure what led us in the direction of diner.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Asim Tanvir: </strong>We see it from the community and the player data, that the smaller maps, the players like them more.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Something like 70% of the players just play Tanglewood Drive, so now we're trying to create maps that are a similar size, so the diner aligns with that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What lessons have you learned from making bigger maps like Brownstone High School or the prison? How does it feel to make something like the prison and the high school, and see the data that so few people play them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It takes a long time to make those maps. But we are reworking all the maps, which includes the prison and school, similar to how we reworked Sunny Meadows. And we might be making the prison and the school smaller as a part of that rework, as well as making them a lot higher quality. Because currently in the school there's a lot of rooms that are more or less the same. So we want all the rooms as unique as possible. Which is why when we did the Grafton Farmhouse rework, we cut out some of the bedrooms to make them more unique, and added certain things like mannequins and dolls.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Now we have a big team. A big art team and an art director as well. So Grafton and the Bleasdale farmhouse rework is what their focus is. Bleasdale is ornate looking, while Grafton is the opposite. It's dark and dingy. Dilapidated.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight</strong>: The reason why we do stuff like that in reworking maps is because we want the game to have an identity beyond the game mechanics. Because I used stock Unity assets to make the game initially, you can go into other games and see the same assets.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So it really sounds like the major push is graphical fidelity, allowing the game to have its own identity, and refining what's already there. A lot of my experience and relationship with the game is playing with friends and laughing at how the character models move. Like the infamous bendy backs. We still love the game, and get very scared, but it's formed alongside the game's visual quirks as well.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I know replacing the character models is a part of the roadmap. And I understand that if you want the game to have a higher benchmark, then that means changing the character models too. I just hope there's a toggle for the original character models and bendy backs. </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Now that the team has grown, and its primary focus is Phasmaphobia, do you have any thoughts on Kinetic Games becoming more an entity outside of being a one-man-studio when Phasmaphobia first began development. How are you viewing the growth and identity of Kinetic Games beyond just Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was very hard getting into the headspace to hire people. Even when we decided to bring it to consoles, it was still only five of us. That's when we decided to start hiring more designers, more artists. Now there's 32 of us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have ideas for other games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Yeah. There's always ideas in the back of my head all the time.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Once Phasmaphobia releases Horror 2.0, then we'll start thinking about new stuff. So nothing concrete we're working on right now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Daniel, in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/phasmophobia-devs-look-back-on-5-years-of-success/2300-6465841/" data-ref-id="2300-6465841">previous interview</a> with GameSpot, you admitted you didn't really play horror games. Has making Phasmaphobia changed your perspective on horror games, or playing them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I think for me, it's interesting to watch people play, and watch them still be scared even if they're playing with three of their friends. Most horror games, even multiplayer ones, everyone's just kind of running away from each other. And I wanted to make a game where the players are actually experiencing the horror together.</p><p dir="ltr">And it was interesting to see that's what actually happened when Phasmaphobia launched. I didn't do much play testing before the game's release. I just wanted to get it out there and just see what people did with it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have you ever been scared by your own game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>There's definitely been moments. We're adding new stuff into the game as well, and we're always hearing people in the office getting jump scared. QA team, art team, programming team – you can hear them screaming from across the office.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is it like having an office full of people scared all the time?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>It means things are working.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Since you're a fan of horror films, what's it like now working with Blumhouse Productions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Oh yeah, I like most of their stuff already. I think The Conjuring Series are my favorite.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's your favorite of The Conjuring films?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The second one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's the right answer. You've mentioned in a previous interview that you're fan of shows like Ghost Adventurers, was there a horror movie or show that specifically inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The Haunting of Hill House was the big one, because it was mostly tension based. Then there's a TV series called The Terror. Those two were the main two that inspired Phasmaphobia.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>If movies and TV primarily inspired Phasmaphobia, and you don't play horror games, what kind of games do you play? And any that inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I don't have too much time to play games. But I've been playing a lot of Rematch. I prefer to play games where I can jump in for 30 minutes and stop. It's one of the reasons why I designed Phasmaphobia that way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kinetic Games has been getting a lot of press recently because of the movie deal and staffing up the team, releasing new maps and redesigning old ones. What are some of the things you don't get to talk about as much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>When the game was so successful at the start, I think a lot of people assumed we were a 200 person team, and I'd say no. It was just me. And when people started finding out that it wasn't some massive team, everyone seemed a little confused. We're even still getting that now, even with the 32 people we have now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When did you realize you needed to hire people?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was seven or eight months after release. I think I was working 60 plus hours a week. Every day, and on the weekends. And it got to a point where I couldn't do that for years and years. So I had to hire people so I could have a life.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What were you doing for a living when you first started developing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I had been out of work for a while. I didn't have a lot of experience making a game. I just wanted to try and do it, and stuck with that for a while.</p><p dir="ltr">I really wanted to work for myself. I was living with my parents at the time which made things significantly easier.</p><p dir="ltr">My parents told me it was time to get a real job. Even me at the time, I didn't have any real expectations for the game. My goal was to sell a thousand copies, and that was surpassed in a few hours after it was released.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You started the game alone and used existing assets. So the identity of the game was in its mechanics. Then it got in the hands of the community, and they started to inform the game's identity in culture. Now, you have a team of people working on the game, changing the way it looks, and polishing it up. Where do you strike the balance of your vision, the communities expectations, but also that of a team and how they're contributing? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>90% of it is the teams' vision, which a lot of it comes from me. But when the game was released, I couldn't get every feature in there that I wanted. So a lot of the work we're doing now is kind of getting that done. And now we're getting input from the art team which is great. We take in community feedback, obviously. Every month we're doing a feedback form on our Discord. We go through all of that. It doesn't necessarily shape how we move forward, but it informs minor changes we make.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the one thing the community asks for that you will not put in the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>One of the biggest requests we get is to allow players to be able to capture the ghost after identifying it.

                <p>I've come to Sensei Takahashi to learn the way of the yari, but we are sitting on the edge of a cliff facing the ocean, painting sumi-e. Ghost of Yotei gives you plenty of opportunities to take a break from slaying ronin to partake in the East Asian painting style, but this is the first time it's been part of protagonist Atsu's training.</p><p dir="ltr">It makes sense, though. Sucker Punch's highly anticipated sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima tells the story of a woman warrior on a quest for revenge, and in between bouts of brutal killings, Atsu follows many of the same practices as the original game's protagonist, Jin Sakai. She meditates at hot springs, honors deities at shrines, follows animals to points of interest, and releases captive creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">But Atsu is even more connected to nature than Jin, and her affinity for the arts, coupled with her dogged, deadly determination, makes Ghost of Yotei a divine take on the power of femininity.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The warrior woman</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu, portrayed with impressive depth by actor Erika Ishii, is a complicated young woman. Though she is stubborn and rigid in her belief system (that the people who killed her family all those years ago must die by her hand, no matter what), there is a softness about her that she seems determined to hide from other people. When travelers come to sit by her campfire, she reflexively reaches for her katana--only when it's clear that they're someone in need, or a lover of the shamisen (Japanese string instrument), or a member of the Ainu (the indigenous people of Hokkaido), does she soften.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That barrier is for her own protection, of course. Being a woman in 1600s Japan meant being obedient to your husband and other men. Women weren't permitted to travel alone, though working-class women were expected to work, either alongside their husbands or, if in urban areas, as hostesses at sake shops or as maids. Atsu has no husband, and she spent the majority of her life learning how to fight and roaming to earn money doing it, so any encounter with a stranger brings questions and incredulity.</p><p>"Like hell we will; she's a woman," a settler spits when his friend offers to pay Atsu to ride along with them for protection.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond incredulity, there's the ever-present threat of violence. A woman you meet along the way tells a story of how, for years, she hid amongst men, at one point silently sustaining a brutal branding for fear of revealing her identity. Another moment sees Atsu enter the private quarters of a samurai leader, just to find him undressed and expecting a sex worker. Later, she moves virtually unseen through a sake house because she has (reluctantly) worn a kimono. While playing a game of zeni hajiki (inspired by the Japanese children's game ohajiki), her opponent regales Atsu with a story of how a meek, demure woman came into his gambling den years ago and fleeced all the men who underestimated her. We later learn that it was Atsu's mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when it's not the center of the story or the cause of conflict, Atsu's womanhood is ever-present, like a paper-thin veil draped over the world. Will those men up the road try to attack, or offer to sell her their wares? Will this bloodthirsty despot accept the bounty she has brought him, or throw her in jail and subject her to horrors only women know?</p><p dir="ltr">Ecofeminists point to the problems that arise when we connect women to nature, just to subjugate both. At the behest of a mad leader known only as the Oni, fire-wielding Oni Raiders stalk a corner of Yotei, setting farms ablaze and destroying the landscape, black scars cutting through large swaths of the land. When a woman tries to escape their prison, those same men kill her and hang her body in front of the jail cells, a warning to any who dare resist.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu sees these people for what they are: a danger not only to her, but to any vulnerable creature or blade of grass in Yotei.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A force of nature</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu is most vulnerable around the creatures of Yotei and when she's exploring its forests, plains, and mountaintops, because she's at home there. She's safe there. It's there that she frequently stops to pull out her sumi-e tools and paint waves crashing against the bluffs, or bows in front of a small wooden sign just to be enveloped in Japanese fireflies, or plucks her shamisen while astride Shimaki, her horse.</p><p dir="ltr">She possesses a seemingly supernatural ability to connect with nature--whether it's finding and soothing runaway horses to lead them back to their owner, playfully wondering where a fox is leading her just to discover something spectacular, or summoning a wolf to her side with the strum of her shamisen. Atsu is a literal force of nature: a woman with the wind always at her back and wolves ready to be called, fangs bared, to dig into some man's flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">When Atsu relaxes at a hot spring, she'll often be joined by an animal friend or two: a massive snowy buck or a few chittering foxes. She prefers these friends to the ones who look like her. "Sometimes I wish I had people to talk to, but then people open their mouths and talk and talk and talk--and then I remember why I'm alone," Atsu says, neck deep in milky-blue water.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking to people, for Atsu, often ends with them at the end of her katana. "I don't hurt kids or animals," Atsu says. Instead, she hurts the men hurting animals, sometimes with those very same animals by her side. She is the personification of nature's rage, her sword piercing through armor like the icy wind atop Mount Yotei.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you could argue that Yotei is an extension of Tsushima's Shinto themes (an indigenous Japanese religion that believes gods are found in nature), Atsu's connection to the natural world is much deeper than Jin's. And when interwoven with the rumors swirling around Yotei that she is an onryō (a vengeful spirit refusing the afterlife until their revenge is doled out), Atsu's ties with nature grow even stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">She can summon this feminine, supernatural power to let loose an Onryō Shout, terrifying the men in front of her into submission--she pulls her arms inward, seemingly drawing in power from the air around her, before letting loose a blood-curdling scream that shakes the earth, flattens grass, and drops men to their knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu is a force of nature, and a soldier in the protection of it. Throughout Ghost of Yotei, we see her summon its power to mete out justice for men, women, children, and animals who have been mistreated by the men in power, by the people who would rather burn the land than watch it flourish. It's easy to root for her, to get sucked into playing just one more side mission where you slaughter wolf trappers or climb just one more rock face to bow at an altar resting at the mouth of the sky. She is nature's protector--a divinely dangerous woman--and we're just helping her along.</p>
