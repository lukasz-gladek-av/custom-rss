                <p>Full refunds are now available to people who purchased a falsely advertised N95 face mask from Razer. The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/ftc-sends-more-1-million-full-refunds-customers-deceived-false-claims-n95-grade-zephyr-face-masks" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">US Federal Trade Commission announced</a> that checks and PayPal payments are on their way to 6,764 customers of the futuristic-looking accessory.</p><p dir="ltr">In May 2024, the FTC announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-face-mask-didnt-meet-n95-requirements-company-fined-over-1-million/1100-6523149/" data-ref-id="1100-6523149">a settlement was reached with Razer for more than $1 million</a>. The fine occurred because Razer claimed its face mask met N95 requirements, even though it was never submitted for certification to test whether it removed 95% of airborne particles, per the FTC.</p><p dir="ltr">In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-unveils-smart-n95-face-mask-with-rgb-lighting-and-voice-amplification/1100-6486149/" data-ref-id="1100-6486149">Razer revealed the N95 face mask with RGB lighting and voice amplification</a> at CES in January 2021. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-launches-new-gaming-headsets-chairs-and-a-facemask-at-razercon-2021/1100-6497287/" data-ref-id="1100-6497287">The Razer Zephyr face mask eventually launched in October 2021</a> for $100. However, just months later in January 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-removes-n95-grade-claims-from-rgb-zephyr-mask/1100-6499502/" data-ref-id="1100-6499502">Razer removed the N95 claims about the face mask</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of the settlement with the FTC, Razer stated that it disagreed with the agency's allegations and didn't "admit to any wrongdoing." Meanwhile, the FTC says checks must be cashed within 90 days for the Zephyr face mask refunds, while PayPal payments need to be redeemed within 30 days.</p><p dir="ltr">For more information about the refund, the FTC points people to call Simpluris at 1-833-285-3003 or to check out <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/recent-ftc-cases-resulting-refunds/refund-programs-frequently-asked-questions" rel="nofollow ">the agency's FAQ page</a>. This isn't the only notable gaming-related refund. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-settlement-payouts-are-now-going-out-so-you-might-have-money-waiting-for-you/1100-6528329/" data-ref-id="1100-6528329">Fortnite settlement refunds started going out to players</a>, with the total round of payments equaling roughly $72 million.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="973131773" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When Dr. Doot took the stage on the final day of AGDQ 2025, the pressure was on. The speedrunner, whose nickname is surprisingly descriptive--he has a doctorate in music composition--was attempting a live run of Elden Ring using a digital saxophone as a controller. Beating Elden Ring's toughest bosses via traditional methods is difficult enough, but Dr. Doot put that PhD to good use and quickly slayed the final boss, as well as the maddingly difficult optional boss Malenia.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot had the chance to chat with Dr. Doot (who wished to only use his handle rather than his real name), and we were surprised to learn how the saxophone speedruns came to be. Rather than coming about simply as another way to beat Elden Ring or Dark Souls, they were an extension of Dr. Doot's practice on his digital instrument, the Roland Aerophone.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Aerophone actually became a game controller initially as a joke," he explained. "I actually got the Aerophone to help me with my music composition, because I play saxophone. And then I found the program that you can use to translate MIDI input, which is what the saxophone sends to the computer, to [computer] keyboard input. Then I realized, 'Oh, you can play games that way then!'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaCvZd7iOkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yaCvZd7iOkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The setup is relatively intuitive and undeniably hilarious. The keys of the Aerophone are mapped to different functions in whatever game Dr. Doot is playing. In the case of Elden Ring, only his character's movement is handled via an analog nub on the back of the device. Everything else, including moving the camera, is accomplished by pressing down the corresponding keys and blowing into the mouthpiece. This produces a "doot" noise, which is funny on its own, but hilarious when it's accompanying violent sword attacks finishing off a deadly boss. This, naturally, elicited plenty of laughs from the packed Wyndham Grand in Pittsburgh, and there have been some occasions when he's accidentally composed a new melody on the fly.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every once in a while, something wacky will happen, where I'll have a very specific script, and I'll play a jazz lick out of nowhere--it's really funny. And it always catches me off guard, like, 'Wait, that actually sounds like music!'"</p><p dir="ltr">Other games have allowed for more literal applications of the Aerophone, such as The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in which Dr. Doot matched the button inputs for the ocarina songs to the keys of the Aerophone. Still, it sounds like using the instrument for… unintended gaming purposes seems to be a priority now, and he has a very lofty goal.</p><p dir="ltr">"There are only a handful of people who have done a full hitless run of the Dark Souls trilogy back to back. So, playing through all three games back to back without taking a single hit in any of the games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4428031"></a><figcaption>Incredible image not at all doctored by Darryn Bonthuys</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4428031-elden-ring-doot-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But that isn't his Mt. Everest: Dr. Doot's ultimate goal is to complete what the community calls "God Run 3." This consists of beating not only the three Dark Souls games, but also Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro, and Elden Ring--all without taking a single hit. Only a few people have been able to do this using traditional means, which would make a saxophone run one of the most legendary gaming accomplishments in history.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, one genre proves nearly impossible to play using this method for Dr. Doot: the shooter. Controlling the camera and weapons using the Aerophone proved to be maddening with playing Doom 2016, as did the third-person shooting in the Resident Evil 2 remake. Perhaps someone will create the first true FPS (first-person saxophone) game and allow him to finally cross the genre off his list. For now, however, beating some of the hardest games in the world in one of the funniest ways possible is plenty impressive. Doing so with thousands of people watching, both in-person and online, is even more mind-blowing.</p>

                <p>Microsoft reportedly considered completely shutting down Xbox in 2021, prior to its acquisition of ZeniMax and Activision Blizzard.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsofts-gaming-business-falls-short-despite-activision" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Information</a>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly had the choice in 2021 of winding down Xbox, or acquiring more studios to drive Game Pass subscriptions. He chose the latter, purchasing both ZeniMax for $7 billion in 2021 and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion in 2023.</p><p>Some big-name studios have also reportedly have not been swayed by Xbox Game Pass, which doesn't bode well for Microsoft's internal target numbers. Prior to its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft reportedly wanted to hit 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2030, which would mean tripling its current base in five years. However, Microsoft has reportedly been unable to hit Game Pass internal growth targets in the past two years.</p><p>Microsoft also reportedly wanted other developers to rent its Azure servers after the Activision acquisition. Ironically, Activision reportedly still rents Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services while using its own servers for development, instead of utilizing Azure.</p><p>Since the launch of Xbox Series X|S, Microsoft has seen some ups and downs, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closure of four of its own ZeniMax studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">lay offs</a> last year. While many developers participate in putting their games on Game Pass, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said back in 2022 that it doesn't make sense to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">put new releases into the service on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>A new report may contain fresh clues about the apparent partnership between Ubisoft and Tencent, Ubisoft's fortunes continue to slide and the company looks for a way forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-15/tencent-guillemot-family-are-said-to-mull-ubisoft-asset-venture" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Ubisoft and Tencent are considering, among other options, "creating a new venture" that could include "certain Ubisoft assets." The overall aim is to improve the company's value, sources said. The two companies are now "evaluating which assets to include in a new entity and their valuation," the report said, citing anonymous sources.</p><p>Should a deal come together, Tencent could "gain more control over" some of Ubisoft's franchises, the report said, adding that Tencent would also benefit from improving its own business results outside of China.</p><p>Sources told Bloomberg that no final decisions have been made and that conversations remain ongoing. None of this should be surprising, either, as Ubisoft said on January 9 that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">appointed advisors to examine opportunities for Ubisoft to maximize the value of its company</a> through a variety of possible business maneuvers. In a conference call, though, Ubisoft declined to comment on the reported Tencent discussions, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">date back many months.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Tencent declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg, while a representative for Ubisoft pointed to the January 9 announcement.</p><p>During a conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value. It was previously reported that Ubisoft was considering numerous different possibilities for its future, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">selling to Tencent.</a></p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft's share price rose on January 15, following the publication of Bloomberg's report. This came after periods of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">consistent declines.</a> Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">delayed its next big game, Assassin's Creed Shadows, to March.</a></p><p>In related news, the Biden administration recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-blacklists-tencent-over-alleged-ties-with-chinese-military/1100-6528668/" data-ref-id="1100-6528668">added Tencent to a list of companies affiliated with the Chinese military.</a> Tencent said the US government "clearly" made a mistake, going on to deny that it is a military company or supplier for the Chinese government.</p>
