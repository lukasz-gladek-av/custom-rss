enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p><p>Currently, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers the standard selection of easy, medium, and hard difficulty options, as well as several gameplay modifiers to further fine-tune the experience to be more forgiving or more punishing.</p><p>Interestingly, the game that Shadows is often compared to, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima, put a spin on an extreme difficulty mode not long after that game was released in 2020. Lethal Mode made Ghost of Tsushima feel more dangerous overall, as both players and enemies could deliver lethal damage with a single attack.</p><p>Alongside smaller parry windows and enemy aggression being dramatically increased, that made the open-world samurai game more interesting than simply turning enemies into sponges that could absorb an absurd amount of damage; perhaps Ubisoft could adopt a similar approach with Shadows if it chooses to introduce a new difficulty mode.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been off to a strong start so far</a>--although not quite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/">as strong as Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">Ubisoft also announced a major change to its organization</a> last week, as it revealed that it had created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent has invested $1.25 billion USD in a minority stake of this subsidiary.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest unanswered questions in all of gaming for 2025 is when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a> will be released. Take-Two and developer Rockstar Games have yet to announce a date, and that could be part of the plan.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick told Bloomberg TV's Wall St. Week that while some of its competitors may announce release dates or windows years into the future, that's not what Take-Two will usually do. When asked directly why Take-Two is being so secretive about GTA 6's release date, Zelnick said the publisher likes to hold back marketing materials until "relatively" close to launch.</p><p>"The anticipation for [GTA 6] may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times. And I've been in every entertainment business there is," he said. "We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. We have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. We've found the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, and balance the excitement with unmet expectation. We don't always get it right. But that's what we're trying to do."</p><p>In terms of marketing materials, so far, Rockstar Games has released just one trailer for GTA 6--and it arrived all the way back in December 2023. Rockstar Games has not released any additional trailers or screenshots, or discussed the game at all since then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zelnick also discussed why it's taken more than a decade for Rockstar Games to release GTA 6 following GTA 5's launch in 2013. Zelnick said whereas some of its competitors launch new entries in major franchises on a semi-regular basis, Take-Two's teams "set an intention" of letting certain franchises rest, in part to create hype. While it's true Rockstar has not released a numbered GTA sequel since 2013, the franchise has hardly rested, as Rockstar launched the game on new platforms and continued to expand the series with ongoing updates to GTA Online.</p><p>Take-Two's sports games are annualized, but for non-sports games, Zelnick said, "We think you need to create enormous anticipation." Also, Zelnick said it simply "takes a long time" to make a big game like GTA 6. "Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. Perfection is a pretty high bar. It takes a long time," he said.</p><p>Also during the interview, Zelnick said part of the reason why Take-Two's franchises have been successful over the years, including the GTA series, is because Take-Two is able to recruit and retain top talent. Zelnick said he has no creative talent himself but has "some ability to figure out who's really talented" and then hire them. He said Take-Two's management teams largely let individual developers work on their projects with autonomy. "We're not bugging them any more than necessary," he said.</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that Take-Two's teams are granted "essentially unlimited financial resources to create perfection." What's more, Take-Two has a revenue-sharing plan, so when a game succeeds, some of the proceeds are passed on to developers in the form of bonuses. All of these factors contribute to helping Take-Two retain top talent, Zelnick said.</p><p>GTA 6 is officially set for release sometime in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC release potentially to follow later on</a>. Take-Two and Rockstar Games not assigning the game a release date is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-not-being-revealed-yet-could-be-disastrous-for-some-analyst-says/1100-6530312/" data-ref-id="1100-6530312">causing turmoil for developers who are seeking to schedule their own games to avoid it.</a></p><p>Another major Take-Two game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> from developer Gearbox, is launching on September 23. Given the expectation that Take-Two would likely want to give that game some room to breathe, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">some are expecting GTA 6 to potentially follow in October or November.</a></p>
