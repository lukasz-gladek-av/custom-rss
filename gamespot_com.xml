                <p>Each year The Game Awards sees its fair share of viral moments both cringe and heartwarming, but none have persisted through the years quite so much as orchestra member Pedro Eustache--better known as "Flute Guy." Fittingly, Flute Guy once again got his moment in the spotlight this year, showing off his strangest flute variant yet.</p><p>Ever since he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26w76OmzEKI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went viral in 2022</a> for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528392/" data-ref-id="1100-6528392">been a regular feature of The Game Awards</a>. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613" data-ratio="0.56235294117647" data-width="1700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613"></a><figcaption>Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg"></figure><p>2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997327335725596961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media pages</a> in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.</p><p>Flute Guy, and the whole orchestral mix, added some needed drama to one of the most obvious Game of the Year announcements The Game Awards has seen. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">most award-winning game</a> in the awards show's history when it picked up nine awards, including Game of the Year. It had previously secured the record for most nominated game, receiving 13 total nominations. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025</a>.</p><p>For all the rest of the winners, losers, and surprises from The Game Awards 2025, check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">all the biggest announcements</a> from the show, as well as our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">all the 2025 winners</a>.</p>

                <p>Of all the new games announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Orbitals might just be the most charming thanks to its retro anime aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">Orbitals is a two-player co-op adventure, where players step into the roles of Maki and Omura to save their home from a supernatural cosmic storm. Aside from showing off the game's gorgeous '80s anime-inspired visuals, Orbitals' debut trailer also highlights how Maki and Omura will traverse space and work together to solve puzzles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLXtLqTfV7I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YLXtLqTfV7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In one example of how the game's co-op will work, the trailer shows one character piloting a spaceship while another operates the ship's turret. Another portion of the trailer highlights one of the duo using a levitating beam to help transport some important piece of a puzzle, while the other navigates a series of dangerous platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Not much else is known about the game, only that it's being published by Kepler Interactive and developed by the Tokyo-based developer Shapefarm. Orbitals will be released exclusively for the Switch 2 and is slated to arrive in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">There was no shortage of new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">announcements at The Game Awards</a> this year, including a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-four-player-co-op-shooter-from-left-4-dead-creator-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/1100-6536695/" data-ref-id="1100-6536695">co-op shooter from the creator of Left 4 Dead</a> and the next game in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-resonant-debuts-at-the-game-awards-and-it-stars-a-new-playable-character/1100-6536877/" data-ref-id="1100-6536877">Remedy's Control series</a>.
