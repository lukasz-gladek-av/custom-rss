                <p>Cult filmmaker John Carpenter seems to have been having a moment at Gamescom 2025. Not only does his name grace the title for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zombie-swarms-and-vehicle-tech-make-john-carpenters-toxic-commando-more-than-just-another-co-op-fps/1100-6534250/" data-ref-id="1100-6534250">Toxic Commando</a>, Saber Interactive's fun evolution of the zombie co-op FPS, but his sci-fi horror, The Thing, is also a key influence of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/directive-8020s-narrative-fast-travel-feels-like-a-boon-for-completionists/1100-6534319/" data-ref-id="1100-6534319">Directive 8020</a>. Topping it off, it was during the show where the previously announced Halloween, based on the horror classic with Carpenter himself attached as executive producer, had its first trailer it was announced that his defining slasher horror classic Halloween is being turned into a game, with Carpenter himself attached as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">Given it's being developed by Illfonic--the studio behind other licensed horror or horror-adjacent games like Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Predator, and Ghostbusters--in collaboration with Gun Media, Compass International Pictures, and Further Front, it shouldn't be a surprise to learn that this will consist of asymmetrical multiplayer. But this isn't just going to be Friday the 13th: The Game swapping out Jason Vorhees for Michael Myers. For one, the announcement confirms that Halloween will be both a single-player and multiplayer horror experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Although Friday the 13th did technically feature single-player content, these were essentially challenge missions that featured no narrative. Sitting down with design director Jordan Mathewson, he explains that this is very much a story mode experience that the studio is working on with Pollard Studio, the Shanghai-based studio behind Karma: The Dark World. "It does have narrative and cinematic components to really give it a lot of story and exploration into what it is doing," he says. "But we've also been building a lot and iterating in a way that allows us to build a type of experience that stands apart from multiplayer and give you a completely different look at what this type of game can be."</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, apart from the announcement trailer, there has been no further reveal of the gameplay--not even behind closed doors--and so it's still too early to have a clear idea of what to expect from Halloween's story mode, apart from that it will put you in the boots and behind the mask of Michael Myers. But from what I'm able to learn from Matthewson, it sounds deliciously like a serial killer's version of Hitman.</p><p dir="ltr">As Halloween will be using the 1978 movie as its blueprint, that means the setting is in the sleepy rural and suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. "All the decorations, the characters, the clothing are all from the 1970s," he explains. "It's been a lot of fun exploring what that means, and everything that comes with having that kind of technology back then when it comes to actually making the single-player is a big portion of this compared to our previous titles."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Haddonfield may have you just thinking of the iconic suburban neighborhood, its grounded and familiar setting being what elevates the horror when a terrifying killer is let loose in it, Matthewson also assures me that there will be a variety of maps that go beyond that neighborhood. "There's a lot more to Haddonfield that you see throughout the movie that we'll be exploring and making sure there's different types of maps that have different sizes and different types of play styles associated, so it does lend itself to different experiences as you get set on these different maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Having what sounds like large sandbox maps is going to be crucial to Halloween's more slow-paced and stealth-based gameplay. Whereas Friday the 13th boiled down to Jason trying to kill as many counselors as possible within a time limit, Halloween's Haddonfield isn't just a map but a simulation of '70s suburbia, so there will be a lot of NPCs also going about their own routines on Halloween night. The twist is that any one of these can be targets for Myers.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the Agent 47 comparison comes into play, as Myers needs to bide his time, observing an NPC, staying in the shadows, until the opportune moment to kill comes. What this means is that rather than playing as targets trying to escape, the goal of other players is to prevent the massacre from occurring by rescuing the targeted townsfolk, such as convincing them to leave their homes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very stealthy on both sides since Michael of course doesn't want to be seen and he has a more methodical approach, but the civilians are obviously trying to stay out of sight until they have the means to try and combat him," explains Matthewson. Just as it is that assassinating a target out in the open can have everyone coming after you in Hitman, so too it seems that Michael's massacre can be more difficult to pull off if he gives himself away. It will also be possible for the civilian players to escalate things. "You can try to call the cops and convince them there's a murderer on the loose. If the cops come to investigate and start finding evidence, they'll send more and more that create a much more difficult challenge for Michael. He's very powerful, but at the same time, the authority figures will challenge him."</p><p dir="ltr">But without seeing this in action, I can't quite picture in my head how this plays out. Is the bogeyman seriously going to be deterred by a bunch of smalltown cops? If Michael Myers is such a foreboding presence, I also can't imagine his stealth options are going to involve crouching in a bush, but if not then how does he stay stealthy? And given that this game is sticking to just the 1978 movie, which was arguably his most grounded depiction, does that limit the kind of powers he will have when facing both other players as well the rest of the town?</p><p dir="ltr">Alas, those are details we'll have to wait for Illfonic to reveal at a later date. Nonetheless, Matthewson assures me that the studio has been doing a lot of research and working directly with IP holder Compass to explore what Michael is truly capable of. "It retains that grounded nature because it is meant to exist in a reality where you feel vulnerable and you feel like you're in a familiar setting," he says. "It's been really fun to explore that side of it, and making sure we stick to it but then also getting to jump back to Michael's perspective and expand on it in a way that makes it a really interesting, fun, powerful experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Halloween will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Supermassive Games has already proven itself as one of the most popular storytellers in interactive cinematic horror--since Until Dawn's release a decade ago, more than half a dozen similar titles that focus on different monsters have been released. Directive 8020 is the latest of these as part of its anthology series The Dark Pictures, and sees the developer charting new territory in space.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien is one major cornerstone, the film that really showed us how terrifying space can be, while you also play as a crew on board the ship Casseopeia who are due to awake from cryosleep. There's even a touch of 2001: A Space Odyssey, given the presence of a talking supercomputer called Oracle, though playing through the first episode, I don't have enough reason to be suspicious. The grave threat instead is a meteorite that's breached the ship's hull, which has also brought some kind of alien fleshy matter on board that can mimic the appearance of the crew. This is essentially The Thing in space.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Supermassive Game Directive 8020 Pulls Inspiration From The Thing</p>
      </div>
<p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibY6uKgpvw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ibY6uKgpvw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While that will no doubt open up to paranoia among the crew when you're going to question who is or isn't human, at this point the ship only has two monitoring crew up and about, Tomas Carter and Sims, so when the latter suddenly starts behaving murderously aggressive, it's no surprise that something's not right.</p><p dir="ltr">The formula for Supermassive's interactive horror typically involves making choices and reacting to quicktime events, with the occasionally awkward moments of actually controlling a character in third-person. But given that there are times you're going to be hunted, creative director Will Doyle explains that this has meant that Directive 8020's control systems couldn't just follow on from its past Dark Pictures titles.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way the character moves, and the way the camera works [has been] rebuilt from the ground up, and that's to support some of the stealth gameplay that we've put in," he explains. "We've got these real-time threats, who will hunt you down and kill you. So that complete overhaul is new to this game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the same time, a more traditional third-person adventure format also allows for more exploration and puzzles, as you can turn on a flashlight to navigate the creepy, dark corridors of the ship, and also have a scanner that's used for interacting with certain objects. I'm not fully convinced that these sections of gameplay will prove enjoyable--when I play a cinematic horror game, it just feels plodding to be walking around and handling very mundane interactions that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor. It also doesn't help that the build I played also had some awkward moments when the prompt wouldn't come up if you were standing too close to an object--a bug the team had already warned me about in advance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, Doyle insists that this is intentional in the game's design philosophy. "A lot of traditional action-adventure games have these design loops where you're getting ammunition, and we see story as the reward in those loops," he explains. "We have a load of stuff hidden around the world, but they're advancing the story all the time. So within our discovery sections, where you're moving around in control of your character, as well as evading threats, you're also unraveling pieces of this mystery, so the story gets driven throughout."</p><p dir="ltr">However, the new mechanic that intrigues me the most is Turning Points, which essentially breaks down every narrative decision into a story beat that you can not only chart on a menu screen but also return to. In past games, when a decision occurs or a character dies, the story continues and there's no way to undo it. While this way of playing the game still remains in Survivor mode for those who want to live and die by their decisions, I also wondered if the ability to rewind is due to there being more direct character control that can lead to potentially more frustrating mistakes, especially for a more casual audience not used to playing with a controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doyle recalls that there have been players of the studio's past games who have actually stopped playing when a favorite character died because they couldn't be bothered with trying again. And while he admits that Turning Points alleviate this frustration, and helps make the game more approachable for a player worried about their skill level, he says the mechanic is really there to enhance the game for narrative-focused players. Meanwhile, a range of accessibility settings also allow you to effectively reduce the enemy AI to a ghost-themed train ride, where they may be scary but won't ever catch or kill you.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Turning Points are] a save system, but within each individual beat, you can go back to characters who are alive or dead based on decisions made," he explains. "If you rewind to a decision point, you can explore different paths. You can pass anywhere you've been in the story. So when you see the [narrative] tree, you can explore all the way down on the tree. We want people to play the game however they want to play."</p><p dir="ltr">So rather than a rewind mechanic like say, Max's power in Life Is Strange, it's actually better to think of Turning Points as more like a fast-travel system in a narrative game, and a more elegant way to explore different decision paths than save-scumming.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can rewind all the way back as far as you want to go, so even at the end of the game, I can jump right back to any point," Doyle adds, and it's here that the system feels like it's going to be the most beneficial for both completionists who want to comb through every secret or piece of content in the game without having to replay from start to finish. Think of it like being able to skip to any chapter of a DVD, but a lot more interactive. "For [Trophy/Achievement] hunters, there's still a challenge to seeing everything, but the Turning Points [allow] you to whizz back to where you need to get to make those changes. And that's kind of the magic of what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">Directive 8020 releases for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Bethesda is not finished supporting 2023's spacefaring RPG Starfield. Lead creative producer Tim Lab said in a new video that fans can look forward to many new updates to the game over time, including a second story DLC.</p><p>"I'm really excited for players to see what the team has been working on. We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story," he said. "I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights."</p><p>Starfield's first story DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-starfield-dlc-shattered-space/1100-6526794/" data-ref-id="1100-6526794">Shattered Space</a>, was released in September 2024.

                <p>Gears of War: Reloaded, a remaster of the 2006 original game, launched this week--but it didn't go over entirely smoothly.

                <p>Yooka-Laylee earned mixed reviews upon its release in 2017, but that didn't stop it from gaining a faithful following of 3D platforming fans charmed by its Banjo-Kazooie-inspired gameplay--which should come as no surprise, as its developer, Playtonic, consisted of many former Rare employees. While the series has continued with the well-received 2D sidescrolling spin-off, Yooka-Laylee And The Impossible Lair, Playtonic is resurrecting the original Yooka-Laylee with an enhanced remaster dubbed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yooka-Re-Playlee</a> launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in the near future. We don't know the specific release date just yet, but physical preorders for the game are already live, and you can secure your copy for just $50 at Amazon.</p><div title="6534306 - Yooka-Re-Playlee Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4218" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534306 - Yooka-Re-Playlee Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Yooka-Re-Playlee Standard Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FNP1T9WR?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Release TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The $50 Yooka-Re-Playlee Standard Edition is the only version of the game announced so far. No preorder bonuses have been announced yet, either. Nevertheless, you can preorder physical PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch 2 copies at Amazon. It's likely other retailers will offer the game soon. Digital preorders are not open yet, but you can wishlist the game on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Steam.</p>                      </div><p>Yooka-Re-Playlee is a massive rework of the original, featuring improved graphics and animations, new and retooled in-game challenges, and tons of new unlockable content. Playtonic also added helpful tools like a map system to help you navigate its sprawling 3D world and keep track of which challenges you've completed. On top of all that, it will also feature a reorchestrated version of the soundtrack composed by Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie, Mario+Rabbids, Viva Piñata), David Wise (Donkey Kong Country), and Steve Burke (Viva Piñata).</p><p>If you're looking for other 3D platformers to keep you busy Yooka-Re-Playlee arrives, Kirby and the Forgotten Land is an easy recommendation. Not only did the base game earn rave reviews, but its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KirbyTM-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Star-Crossed-Switch/dp/B0F66GWKZS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star-Crossed World</a> expansion arrives for Switch 2 on August 28, bringing with it a slew of new content to explore. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Donkey-Kong-Bananza-Nintendo-Switch-2/dp/B0F66KLYVH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is another great choice that launched earlier this year on Switch 2, and its destructive environments and colorful characters quickly made it a Game of the Year contender. There are also plenty of great 3D platformers on the original (which are also playable on Switch 2), like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-US-Version-Switch/dp/B01MY7GHKJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, which is on sale for $52.49 (was $60). <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> is also discounted, letting you pick up the two Mario adventures for just $51.90 (was $60).
