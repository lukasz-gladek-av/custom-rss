                <p>A live-action Death Stranding movie is currently in an early stage of development, and while no actors have been attached to it yet, the game's original star Norman Reedus sounds interested in appearing in it <em>if </em>he's offered the chance to do so.</p><p>Speaking to IGN during a press junket for the John Wick spin-off film Ballerina, Reedus--who provided the voice and likeness of the game's protagonist Sam Porter Bridges-- was quizzed on if he'd be willing to appear in the Death Stranding movie. "If it was an option, yeah, for sure," Reedus said. "I don't know what's happening with it, right? It's so pre-[production] right now, but yeah, yeah of course."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-death-stranding-film-adaptation-will-reportedly-be-helmed-by-quiet-place-day-one-director/1100-6530647/" data-ref-id="1100-6530647">The Death Stranding movie project has found its director</a>, as Michael Sarnoski is attached to the production. Having previously directed A Quiet Place: Day One, Sarnoski's is currently in post-production on his next film, The Death of Robin Hood.</p><p>Other details about the Death Stranding project that we do know about so far is that it is being co-produced by A24 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-productions-opens-a-film-and-tv-business/1100-6498243/">Kojima Productions</a>, and for the story, game creator Hideo Kojima has hinted at exploring the titular Death Stranding extinction event.</p><p>In related news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be released on June 26</a> for PS5. Ahead of its release, the game has tested very well in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">preview sessions and early reviews</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-scoring-well-with-test-reviewers-but-kojima-isnt-satisfied/1100-6531555/">Kojima did express a desire for the game</a> to be more "controversial" amongst the people playing it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-knows-what-death-stranding-3-could-be-but-he-wont-make-it-himself/1100-6531404/">The developer also has some ideas for a potential threequel</a>, but if it does get greenlit, he plans to pass on development duties to someone else.</p>

Speaking during the company's <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-taketwos-q4-fy2025-revenue-beats-forecast-stock-dips-93CH-4049404" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings briefing</a>, the executive was asked if the trailer's release has led to any positive impact on GTA Online. Zelnick said it's too soon to say, and in fact, it's not something the company is focused too much on anyway.</p><p>Zelnick did, however, remind people that GTA 6's new trailer reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">475 million views in its first 24 hours</a>, setting an all-time viewership record for any trailer ever, spanning games, movies, TV shows, and everything else.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>"So, essentially, once again, Rockstar Games broke the Internet, and we feel really good about that and what that means for the upcoming release of GTA 6," Zelnick said.</p><p>GTA 6's new trailer was the first since the debut trailer in December 2023--there was a huge amount of pent-up demand for any new footage, and people clearly ate it up. The trailer used The Pointer Sisters song <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-2-song-whats-the-tune-playing-and-do-the-lyrics-connect-to-the-story/1100-6531338/" data-ref-id="1100-6531338">"Hot Together,"</a> and the tune experienced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">massive spike in streams after the trailer arrived.</a></p><p>The new GTA 6 trailer was released just a few days after Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">delayed the game to May 2026</a>. While the delay announcement was a bummer for many, the trailer arriving a few days later alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">dozens of new screenshots</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">character information</a> helped ease the pain.</p><p>Responding to the GTA 6 delay, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">Zelnick said the push to 2026 "pains" him.</a> However, Zelnick said it was necessary to delay the game to 2026 because the game needed more polish.</p>
