                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>. Sonic 3 director Jeff Fowler also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-was-dedicated-to-researching-shadow-for-sonic-the-hedgehog-3/1100-6527492/" data-ref-id="1100-6527492">Reeves was serious about researching Shadow's character</a> before he took on the role for the movie.</p><p>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 will be out in theaters on Friday, December 20.</p>

                <p>Sony Group has agreed to buy more than 12 million more shares in Elden Ring parent company Kadokawa Corporation, with Sony becoming Kadokawas's largest shareholder. Sony will own 10% of Kadokawa's shares after buying 12,054,100 new shares for about 50 billion yen ($319 million USD).</p><p>Sony Group <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202412/24-1219E/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it plans to buy the shares on January 7, 2025. It follows on from Sony's previous acquisition of Kadokawa shares in February 2021.</p><p>Sony and Kadokawa have worked together on a number of projects throughout the years, and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors swirled recently </a>that Sony might have been plotting to buy the company outright. That isn't happening, though, at least not at this stage.</p><p>As part of the deal, Sony said it will work together to adapt some of Kadokawa's franchises for global and TV dramas and live-action films, though no specifics projects were announced. Sony will also co-produce Kadokawa anime projects and "further expand" its publishing efforts for Kadokawa's games.</p><p>From Software's Elden Ring is one of Kadokawa's biggest gaming projects, and the series continues in 2025 with the debut of the standalone game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">Elden Ring Nightrein.</a> Beyond gaming, Kadokawa is known for media franchises like Re: Zero and Delicious in Dungeon, among numerous others.</p><p>Sony is also heavily invested in Fortnite studio Epic Games. In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-1-billion-more-into-fortnite-studio-epic-games-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6502349/" data-ref-id="1100-6502349">Sony invested more than $1 billion into Epic Games to help create the metaverse</a>, which followed on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-200-million-more-into-fortnite-developer-epic-to-help-create-the-metaverse/1100-6490077/" data-ref-id="1100-6490077">$200 million investment in 2021</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-250-million-into-fortnite-dev-epic-ga/1100-6479536/" data-ref-id="1100-6479536">$250 million in 2020.</a> All up, Sony has invested more than $1.45 billion into Epic Games, which is about 4.5X more than it just agreed to invest into Kadokawa.</p>

The fixes include players being able to encounter roaming NPCs more often, and greatly extended the distance at which NPCs are visible to players. Additionally, these NPCs will continue to advance towards their own goals over time, even in offline mode, and players may now encounter NPCs that they've previously met by following in the same direction.</p><p>Players will now notice that NPC groups that explore the Zone will be more diverse in terms of possible factions and group sizes, along with enhanced motivation to expand territory and actively attack enemies and mutants.</p><p>Stalker 2 is now available on PC and Xbox, as well as Game Pass. According to GSC World, the <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/stalker-2-has-already-recouped-development-costs-may-get-netflix-series/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game has already turned a profit</a>, despite its buggy state.
