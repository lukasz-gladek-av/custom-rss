                <p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 have seemingly revealed that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/mafia-the-old-country-launches-august-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, 2K and Hangar 13 posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam blog post</a> detailing their plans for PAX East 2025. In this post, the release date was inadvertently announced. While it has now been removed from the post, Gematsu provided a screenshot of the blog post before the release date was scrubbed.</p><p>2K and Hangar 13's PAX East 2025 panel will be hosted at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET on May 8 and they will show off a new gameplay trailer. Attendees will be able to meet some of the developers, including studio president Nick Baynes, game director Alex Cox, and cinematic director Tomas Hrebicek. They will most likely announce the release date during the panel.</p><p>Mafia: The Old Country is a prequel to the first game in the series and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-trailer-and-release-date-leak-ahead-of-reveal/1100-6528413/" data-ref-id="1100-6528413">takes place during the early 1900s in Sicily</a>. More specifically, the game is set in the fictional town of San Celeste, which also made an appearance in Mafia 2 and is mentioned in Mafia: Definitive Edition.</p><p>It will also feature full audio-dubbing tracks in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech, and Russian, as well as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mafia-the-old-country/languages" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sicilian, in order to maintain cultural authenticity</a>.</p>

                <p>No one is doing more for mascot platformers than Toys for Bob. Since 2018, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">formerly Microsoft-owned studio</a> has released the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot 4, and Crash Team Rumble, reinvigorating two beloved but largely stagnant franchises. Now, Toys for Bob co-studio head and creative director Paul Yan says the studio has its eyes on another iconic platforming series: Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanadianGuyE</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">h</a>--which was then reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/since-going-independent-of-activision-microsoft-and-xbox-studio-toys-for-bob-says-theyd-love-to-work-on-a-banjo-kazooie-in-a-new-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>--Yan discussed Toys for Bob's upcoming projects. On top of seemingly teasing a new entry in the Spyro the Dragon series, Yan expressed the team's desire to work with Xbox on bringing back the dynamic bird and bear duo, Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>"One company we'd like to work with is one we're already working with--Team Xbox! They've been a great partner and they also have a very interesting roster of characters that Toys for Bob could have a lot of fun with. The honey bear is the first one that comes to mind--I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right?" Yan said.</p><p>Though this certainly doesn't mean a Banjo-Kazooie remake or reboot is already in the works, Toys for Bob's past work and relationship with Xbox makes this collaboration seem more like a matter of "when" than "if." Despite the studio breaking apart from the Microsoft-owned studio Activision back in 2023, it has continued to work closely with Xbox, and is currently collaborating with the company on an upcoming project that many <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/spyro-4-rumours-toys-for-bob-tease/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculate to be Spyro the Dragon 4</a>. Though Yan said he "can't spill the beans just yet" on the upcoming project, he assured fans that development is going well.</p><p>"I will say that we're very much in the thick of development. The team is very thrilled about how the experience is shaping up. This game is big and ambitious and pushes our craft to new heights."</p><p>Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">leaving Activision</a>, Toys for Bob had been moved from working on the whimsical platformers it's known for to assist the Call of Duty series as a support studio. According to a former senior concept artist, Nicholas Kole, the team was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">forced to scrap Crash Bandicoot 5</a>. After 86 employees were laid off from the studio as a part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft's 2023 mass layoffs</a>, the studio sought, and was given, independence.</p>

                <p>Anyone familiar with Nintendo's favorite gourmand Kirby knows that the pink blob has an insatiable appetite.

The left earcup shows Kirby preparing to inhale the headphones, while the right earcup displays Kirby's "mouthful" face.</p><p>As for the audio specs and performance, these are basic 3.5mm stereo headphones with 50mm dynamic speaker drivers and a detachable boom mic.

                <p>One of the biggest talking points surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> since its official announcement has been focused on the price of the console and its games--some believe the prices are simply too much.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSu0BQFTFPA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayerDriven</a>, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said Nintendo can charge what it wants for new first-party Switch 2 games because Nintendo makes compelling games. Some people might perceive the price increase for a game like Mario Kart World ($80) as being "hefty," Layden said, but in the end, people will buy it anyway.</p><p>"If it's the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad," he said (<a

years.</p><p>"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up," he said, adding that he thinks publishers should have charged $5 more for new games each new console generation.</p><p>Meanwhile, actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/abubakar-salim-why-price-of-games-accessible/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that inclusivity is an important consideration to remember in a conversation about general socioeconomic issues. Salim questioned why Nintendo is charging more for the Switch 2 console and games.</p><p>"We're in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It's a family platform," Salim said.</p><p>For Mario Kart World, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">defended the $80 price point</a> by saying the game is a worthy upgrade over Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and people will understand this after the April 17 Nintendo Direct. Meanwhile, others have said Nintendo chose to price Mario Kart World at $80 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-80-because-thats-what-people-will-pay-for-it-analyst-says/1100-6530715/" data-ref-id="1100-6530715">simply because it can.</a></p><p>At $450, the Switch 2 is about $50 more than the original Switch with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">inflation factored in</a>. Nintendo management says the price hike is justified because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">the Switch 2 is a better, more robust console. </a>Experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-to-be-sold-at-a-loss-due-to-higher-production-costs-analyst-says/1100-6530766/" data-ref-id="1100-6530766">Nintendo will lose money on every Switch 2 it sells</a>, which is common for console hardware.</p>
