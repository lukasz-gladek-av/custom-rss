          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a>'s original Verdansk map would return to the free-to-play battle royale in 2025, but the publisher still hasn't provided further details for the map's release. Now, new leaks have surfaced to suggest a more "OG" version of Verdansk, detailing some of the map's main points of interest.</p><p dir="ltr">According to known Call of Duty insider "<a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" rel="nofollow ">The Ghost of Hope</a>," Verdansk will return with the launch of Season 3. The leaks also suggest that the map will be very similar to the original version that launched back in March of 2020, but the insider does detail a few minor differences.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">EXCLUSIVE Details on the return of Verdansk:<br>- Will launch with Season 3 of BO6<br>- It is pretty much the OG March 2020 version<br>- Train Station interior will be closed<br>- Interior of Stadium will be open BUT roof will be closed<br>- The Train returns<br>- No fast travel subway system <a href="https://t.co/69aAy79RLS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/69aAy79RLS</a></p>  â€” Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1893792956227698707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">One of the most notable details mentioned is that Verdansk will keep the Stadium point of interest with the roof intact. This might be a controversial map decision for Verdansk's return, as the original Stadium could often be a frustrating location to traverse. The building was usually plagued with rooftop campers, and it was also a massive structure to try and maneuver around while running from the gas.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Ghost of Hope does suggest that the interior of Stadium will be open this time, so hopefully players can use interior passages to better escape the area during a circle collapse. It's also worth noting that a post-launch update for Modern Warfare and Warzone included a Verdansk event that blew the top off Stadium to make the point of interest more viable. So, it's possible further map changes could arrive sometime after the return of Verdansk.</p><p dir="ltr">The insider claims that the train is returning with Verdansk, which was a feature that was not part of the original map design. The Train Station point of interest is also mentioned to be included on the map, but the station's interior will be closed off. A fast-travel subway system was added to Verdansk in a later season, but Ghost of Hope says this isn't planned for the map's return.</p><p dir="ltr">While all leaks should be taken with a grain of salt, it's worth mentioning that known Call of Duty dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_/status/1892643037462835327" rel="nofollow ">RealityUK</a> also claims that Verdansk references are now showing in the game files following the Season 2 Reloaded update.</p><p dir="ltr">If true, players won't have long to wait before the fan-favorite Verdansk returns. Based on the days left in the Season 2 battle pass, the Season 3 update should arrive to Black Ops 6 and Warzone around March 20. Until then, players can expect a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-reloaded-adds-tmnt-event-plus-splinter-included-in-paid-pass/2900-6270/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6270">TMNT-themed limited-time event</a> on February 27, and the Clover Craze event arrives on March 13 for early Saint Patrick's Day celebrations.</p>

                <p>With the arrival of a new Superman movie later this year, the new DC Universe continues to grow on film and television. But what about the video games? According to DC Studios co-chiefs James Gunn and Peter Safran, DCU games are still in development, but they're still years away from being released.</p><p>"We work incredibly closely with [Global Streaming and Games CEO] JB Perrette, who runs that division, and it's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Brothers," Safran said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-couple-years-before-we-see-the-first-dcu-video-game-james-gunn-says-but-first-fortnite" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "James and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios underneath JB, whether it's NetherRealm or whether it's Rocksteady, sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p><p>It's worth mentioning that there is a difference between a DCU game and a game based on the characters of DC Comics. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/" data-ref-id="1100-6511036">The DC Universe is essentially the umbrella term encompassing the new shared universe</a> overseen by Gunn and Saffran, which includes characters like the new live-action Superman, the Creature Commandos, and a new silver screen incarnation of Batman who'll be introduced in The Brave and the Bold. To make things slightly more confusing, Matt Reeves' The Batman is part of its own continuity, the, The Batman Epic Crime Saga, that includes The Penguin and an upcoming Clayface project.</p><p>Gunn--who directed the new Superman movie--added that the two co-chairs get to see these projects during their earliest phases while also advising the studios on the direction that they could take with DC's characters. "We talk about when they're talking about what the story might be, we say, 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with this character and so forth and so on,' and help to deal with that," Gunn explained, while Safran added that the first DCU game will be revealed several years from now.</p><p>"Yeah, it's a couple [of] years, but we've had some pretty active involvement in some stuff coming up. It's really interesting," Saffran said.</p><p>Things haven't been rosy for Warner Bros. Games lately, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a critical and financial flop</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus added to the company's financial woes</a>, and Monolith's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/">Wonder Woman game has reportedly cost more than $100 million to date</a>, with very little progress so far. The same report from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier also mentioned that Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal unsuccessfully pitched a John Constantine game and a Flash game was also claimed to be in development until the live-action film bombed, leading to its cancellation.</p><p>The silver lining here is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">Rocksteady is said to be returning to its single-player Batman roots for its next project</a>, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/">WB Games is now focusing its efforts and resources on its biggest franchises</a>.</p>
