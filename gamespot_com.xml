                <p>Pac-Man made the jump to 3D way back in 1999 with Pac-Man World, which earned solid reviews and went on to become something of a cult classic. It would later earn a remake, Pac-Man World Re-Pac, in 2022. A similar thing is now happening with the original game's sequel, Pac-Man World 2. The 3D platformer launched for PS2, GameCube, and Xbox in 2002, and more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK7YV5RB,B0FK8D2W2C,B0FK7ZW7F3,B0FK7Z44K4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is bringing it to a whole new audience with new features, enhanced graphics, and voice acting. Preorders are open ahead of its September 26 release on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC, with two options available: a $30 standard edition and a $40 Digital Deluxe Edition. Preordering the game early also gets you a few bonuses.</p><h2>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542148" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542148"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac Preorder Bonuses</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4542148-81qrqftm7pl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>Preorder any version of Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac, and you'll get four Team Ghost Costumes and four Team Ghost Figures.

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Season 5 update arrives on August 7, bringing the Reckoning as the final Zombies map for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>. Treyarch has <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" rel="nofollow ">released a new video</a> to discuss some of the new features and details players can expect for this Zombies finale, which includes parachutes, upgradable traps, and the brand-new Wonder Weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's latest video gives a deep dive into the Reckoning map, which takes place at Liberty Fall's Janus Towers location. The map features three tall towers for players to fight the undead. These spaces can be navigated with teleporters, anti-gravity launchers, and parachutes, marking the first time parachutes are featured on a traditional round-based Zombies map.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Get an inside look at the conclusion of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> Zombies 🧟‍♂️</p><p>Treyarch takes us inside Reckoning, breaking down the final map and the new features that deliver an unforgettable finale 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/pdQpcmv1XV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/pdQpcmv1XV</a></p></div>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The video also teases that parts of the Reckoning map will feature low gravity. This seems to include the map's Pack-a-Punch room, as the Pack-a-Punch machine can be seen floating around with some zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new feature is the ability to upgrade traps on the map. Players can interact with a new machine on the map called Caster, which lets them upgrade various traps. The video shows off one of the new traps, which is a wall-mounted cannon that shoots dark aether energy, and the developer says the trap can be updated with parts to make it more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows the map's unique Wonder Weapon in action. The Reckoning map features the Gorgofex, which is a pistol-type weapon that fires Aether-based energy. This Wonder Weapon will feature two possible upgrades to make it even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Uberklaus is the name for the map's new elite enemy type. Uberklaus will have two phases to fight. The enemy starts off inside a giant mech suit, and dealing enough damage will cause the robot inside to eject from the suit for the second fight phase.</p><p dir="ltr">This Zombies conclusion arrives along with plenty of new updates for multiplayer and Warzone. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/">Call of Duty Season 5</a> brings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-5-every-new-map-and-mode-coming-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer/2900-6825/">new maps and modes</a> to Black Ops 6 multiplayer, and the rooftop of Warzone's Stadium POI is finally opening up to provide a new playable area.</p>

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September. Diablo 4 was also recently cleared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release in China</a> after receiving governmental approval.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Fall Guys is celebrating its 5-year anniversary today, August 4, 2025. Below, we look back at how its creative mode was ripe for potential that has failed to flourish.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It felt obvious. Fall Guys--a quirky, over-the-top game show battle royale platformer--would be perfect for player-created levels. Mario and Banjo-Kazooie fans could create whimsical deathtraps that dozens of little beans would run through headfirst.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know the chances are extremely low that this will happen, but man, a level editor would be extremely awesome," wrote Redditor2033 in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysGame/comments/q9bwfv/i_know_the_chanches_are_extremly_low_that_this/" rel="nofollow ">post</a> a year into Fall Guys' lifespan. "With that, this game could easily survive A LOT [of] years."</p><p dir="ltr">Things have a funny way of working out sometimes, as Epic Games acquired Fall Guys developer Mediatonic in March 2021 and launched Fall Guys Creative, a level editor where players could create their own islands, a little over two years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Players wasted no time flexing their creative muscles--recreating <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysCreative/comments/1hzxnk8/van_gogh_with_the_flow_code_059604529033/" rel="nofollow ">Van Gogh masterpieces</a>, building a zany take on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysCreative/comments/148et87/mount_olympus_534235823998/" rel="nofollow ">Mount Olympus</a>, and designing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FallGuysCreative/comments/15pm4tg/jungle_vertigo_401477070526/" rel="nofollow ">intuitive jungle-top mazes</a> that rival Mediatonic’s own creations.</p><p dir="ltr">The fervor for mini-game creation spread throughout the Fall Guys community. Players didn't just create maps, they built databases of their favorites, created tutorials to encourage other players, and begged Mediatonic for better tools so they could build bigger and better maps.</p><p dir="ltr">"When Creative first launched, pretty much every stage felt innovative in its own way," Fall Guys map creator mech33 tells GameSpot. "Even something as simple as a sloped stage where iron balls rolled down from above was fun to play with friends."</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Mediatonic even began using Creative for its own designs and started removing some of its older maps as updates caused them to break down, making room for even more creator maps in the rotation. Some map makers called this the golden age of Creative The tool itself was getting regular updates, giving creators a ton of freedom in what they could build.</p><p dir="ltr">Mediatonic began bringing player-created levels into official playlists, giving creators the chance to find audiences almost immediately.</p><p dir="ltr">"Community creative maps were in main game modes, getting millions of plays," Fall Guys map creator Pepppie said over text in a message. " [There was a] big community with great map makers, new good creative maps almost every day."</p><p dir="ltr">The good times wouldn't last. Mediatonic began removing player-created game modes from featured playlists, making it harder than ever for creators to find an audience. GameSpot reached out to Mediatonic for comment on the reason behind the change, but received no comment. Many saw that as the removal of the only incentive to continue creating. Epic supports creators who do well in Fortnite Creative, providing them with a cut of the revenue it makes from the battle royale mode--but while Fall Guys is accessible through the Fortnite platform, Fall Guys creators get no such benefits.</p><p dir="ltr">Mediatonic had formed a creator program that gave creators early access to new items and mechanics as well as feedback from official developers. That group has since been shuttered, according to a few creators who were in it. The Fall Guys creators said they weren't looking for big payouts, but they were hoping for some sort of incentive to push them to continue.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel like the momentum behind Fall Guys Creative has definitely slowed down compared to before," mech33 said. "Recent updates have mostly focused on visual improvements rather than introducing new tools or gimmicks, which makes it harder for creators to find fresh inspiration."</p><p dir="ltr">Even if creators are making maps, it's tough for them to get those maps in front of players, thanks to changes they say Mediatonic keeps making to how maps are surfaced in Fall Guys.</p><p dir="ltr">"Recently, [Mediatonic has] removed all player-made creative maps from main curated game modes, meaning it is now solely based on luck if your map makes it in the few modes left, like Discovery," Pepppie said. "This decision has turned most prominent map-makers off of the game, and many, if not most, have left."</p><p dir="ltr">The level editor has evolved significantly since it launched, according to several creators, but they're still looking for new features and tools like the ability to make chains, hang objects, and build dynamic objects unlike anything else in Fall Guys. Nothing like that has been added recently, but some creators say additional features could be enough to inspire them to build something new.</p><p dir="ltr">When Fall Guys originally launched, there was nothing on the market like it. Sure, it had DNA from Mario Party and a variety of battle royales, but nothing combined the sweaty-palm franticness of Door Dash with the tension of knowing that any moment could be your last as other beans finish in front of you.</p><p dir="ltr">Other games like Fall Guys have risen to match Epic Games' game show battle royale in recent years. Stumble Guys has given mobile players the ability to create levels for tens of thousands of players on Steam and millions on phones. Eggy Party--often called a Fall Guys knockoff--has captured the attention of a huge playerbase in China.</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that there is an appetite for the online experience that Fall Guys provides: hectic mini-games reminiscent of TV shows like Wipeout and Takeshi's Castle. This is especially true when there is an army of creators supplying new levels on a regular basis. That's not the case anymore, but creators hope that changes.</p><p dir="ltr">"If Mediatonic releases new tools or features that get creators thinking, 'I could build something amazing with this,' then the scene could definitely bounce back," mech33 said. "But if meaningful updates keep getting delayed or stop altogether, it’s likely that interest will continue to decline."</p><p dir="ltr">Creators like mech33 still have the desire to make things for Fall Guys, but as it is, there isn't enough to encourage them to push maps across the finish line. For now, Fall Guys Creative exists in a strange limbo: full of potential, but waiting for another spark.</p>
