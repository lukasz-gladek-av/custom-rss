                <p dir="ltr"><em>Animal Crossing: Wild World is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, December 5, 2025. Below, we look at how its modest pathing system laid the groundwork, so to speak, for what the series has become.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Animal Crossing has always balanced two fantasies: the joy of customizing a cozy little town and the simple pleasures of living among a cast of charming, slightly strange animal neighbors. Those two elements worked in tandem. Your creative expression shaped your village, but the daily routines of chatting with neighbors, fishing by the riverbank, and uncovering little surprises gave the world its soul.</p><p dir="ltr">Somewhere along the way, however, customization did not just complement village life--it began to overshadow it. And if you trace that shift back through the franchises' history, the turning point can be found within 2005's Animal Crossing: Wild World.</p><p dir="ltr">When Wild World released on the Nintendo DS, players expected a portable follow-up to the GameCube classic. What they did not expect was that the community would stumble onto a feature that would change how players approached the series forever. It was not a new tool, a new building, or a new villager type. It was something almost laughably simple. It was a path.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZB73-XpxR0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2ZB73-XpxR0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Custom designs already existed, but Wild World allowed players to place those designs freely outdoors. The intended purpose was small decorations and personal flair. What players actually did with the feature was far more ambitious. Once someone placed a tile in front of their house, they realized they could place another, then another, then a line of them stretching down the hillside toward the river. Suddenly, a mere decorative option transformed into a way to redesign the entire town.</p><p dir="ltr">Players began laying designs across their villages to create dirt trails, stone walkways, mossy forest routes, and pixel-art mosaics that zigzagged across the map. Wild World towns became sprawling canvases filled with hand-made road systems, seasonal pathways, and intricate layout experiments. A village was no longer just a place you inhabited. It was something you curated down to the color of a leaf laying on the ground under your feet.</p><p dir="ltr">This discovery fundamentally shifted how players thought about Animal Crossing. For the first time, one town could look drastically different from another. In the GameCube original, towns varied based on layout and villager mix, but they all followed the same structure. Wild World gave players the means to break from that structure entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo only formally embraced paths years later, but Wild World’s influence appeared in every entry that followed. City Folk still let players carve out basic routes using designs, even if the system was more limited. New Leaf opened the floodgates. The introduction of custom design QR codes sparked a golden age of path sharing on Tumblr, GameFAQs, and early Twitter. Players traded wooden planks for rustic forests, geometric tiles for urban hubs, stone borders for garden pathways, and soft floral stepping stones for cottages long before cottage-core became a cultural phenomenon.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came the real shift in how Animal Crossing functioned.</p><p dir="ltr">When Animal Crossing: New Horizons launched in 2020, Nintendo finally acknowledged that paths had become central to the series. The Island Designer app made path placement a built-in system rather than an improvised one. Terraforming lets players reshape cliffs, rivers, and coastlines to match the layouts they envisioned. For many players, building an island felt less like moving into a place and more like designing it from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">New Horizons was a global phenomenon, but it also solidified the series' new identity. Players became architects first, residents second. The core loop encouraged planning and layout experimentation. Some created zen gardens and tranquil forest towns. Others built dense shopping districts, amusement piers, horror-themed mazes, or entire cities with street grids and elevated walkways. The island's shape and flow became the primary creative outlet.</p><p dir="ltr">This evolution traces directly back to Wild World. Once players discovered they could cover entire towns with handmade designs, the series gradually shifted from a life sim about daily rituals to a platform for personal expression. The small social rhythms of talking to villagers and discovering tiny events still mattered, but they increasingly played a supporting role. The atmosphere began to matter more than routine. Layout mattered more than tradition.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MaxHm2zu0AE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MaxHm2zu0AE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The shift did not diminish the original charm of Animal Crossing. Instead, it showed how flexible the series could be. What began as a relaxed slice-of-life sim with quirky animals became, little by little, a playground for digital landscaping, environmental storytelling, and light urban planning. Animal Crossing grew up alongside its players, reflecting changing tastes and expanding creative ambition.</p><p dir="ltr">Nearly twenty years after Wild World, paths still sit at the heart of how players shape their towns. Entire YouTube channels and TikTok creators dedicate themselves to showcasing island layouts. Fan-made path sets circulate like seasonal fashion lines, complete with new color palettes and patterns each month.</p><p dir="ltr">Paths determine whether a town feels like a rustic forest hideout, a bright beachside boardwalk, a modern city block, a mystical grove, or a retro village pulled from a Super Nintendo RPG. They guide how you move through your town and how you experience it day to day. They influence everything from your morning routine to your choice of furniture themes.</p><p dir="ltr">As Wild World celebrates another anniversary this December, it is fitting to recognize the small, player-driven innovation that changed everything. Wild World may not be the flashiest entry in the series, but it laid down something more important than a set of tiles. It laid down the path for what the franchise would become.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced more details on the next big update for GTA 5's multiplayer mode, including the long-awaited return of Michael De Santa.</p><p>Michael is one of GTA 5's three main playable characters, and fans have been waiting for a long time to interact with him again after the events of the main story. A GTA Online expansion from 2021 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">confirmed that Michael was still alive</a>. In the soon-to-release A Safehouse in the Hills expansion, he's back--and he looks older. Take a look for yourself in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJ-lT0sBhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/APJ-lT0sBhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtav-story-dlc-coming-in-2014/1100-6416619/" data-ref-id="1100-6416619">All the way back in 2013</a>, Rockstar Games said it would release more story content that extended the stories of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-adding-story-dlc-featuring-gta-5s-franklin-and-dr-dre/1100-6498737/" data-ref-id="1100-6498737">previous DLC for GTA Online focused on Franklin</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-why-gta-5-trevor-dlc-was-reportedly-scrapped/1100-6524713/" data-ref-id="1100-6524713">plans for a Trevor-focused expansion were apparently canceled.</a></p><p>Actor Ned Luke, who plays Michael, responded to Rockstar's announcement by saying, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1996971077998637459" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Daddy's back bitches."</a></p><p>Michael returns to Los Santos in the update on December 10, and the major focus of the expansion are new mansions in expensive neighborhoods that players can buy and live in. Players can spend their ill-gotten gains on mansions from Prix Luxury Real Estate. The homes are massive and contain things that rich people like, including trophy cabinets, salons, and huge garages. There are also animal kennels, and this means the new GTA Online update is adding personal pets as well.</p><p>There is also a new AI Assistant in the game, and given Rockstar's propensity for parody, it's possible the AI will have some lines that skewer the modern trend of AI assistants in the real world. You can hear some of the AI's voice lines in the trailer.</p><p>What's more, players should remember that they have until December 7 to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-free-right-now-lets-you-get-a-big-discount-on-new-mansions/1100-6536179/" data-ref-id="1100-6536179">complete special missions</a> to earn major discounts on buying the new mansions that are coming to the game on December 10.</p><p>In addition to ongoing support for GTA Online, Rockstar is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and will launch the game in November 2026, following multiple delays.</p>

                <p>AdHoc CEO Michael Choung thinks most studios should avoid episodic releases, a stance he makes clear even as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dispatch-review-fantastic-superhero-tv/1900-6418442/" data-ref-id="1900-6418442">Dispatch</a>--the studio’s debut superhero workplace comedy--has become a runaway success. Choung says the weekly-release format that helped Dispatch explode past 1 million sales in 10 days and put it on track to hit its three-year sales target in just three months was difficult at every turn and an actual "insane thing to do."</p><p>Speaking to technology newsletter <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=788256D6-9F75-4793-8D5F-28F96B1C91A8&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Knowledge</a>, Choung recalled being warned repeatedly that releasing the game week by week instead of all at once was a terrible idea. But the team believed the format was essential for the story. "What's inside that game is basically three feature-length premium animated films and a video game, all meshing and rubbing up against each other," he said. The narrative had always been structured episodically, even though it went against industry "conventional wisdom."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dispatch Review</p>

<p>Despite internal debate, AdHoc settled on releasing two episodes weekly rather than dropping the game all at once, splitting it into halves, or spacing out individual episodes. The bet paid off dramatically. "There would just be a longer time period for it to be covered," Choung explained. This kind of schedule created a sense that "the train is leaving the station, but not just yet--I can still make it," which encouraged players to jump in. Contrary to expectations that week-two numbers would fall, concurrent users kept doubling with each release.</p><p>"Those things, we anticipated. I don't think we anticipated the scale of it," he said.</p><p>Still, Choung insists this approach shouldn't become a trend. "From every metric, from a production perspective, no one should do this. If you think episodic alone is going to be the thing that dictates success for you, then good luck!” he said. While AdHoc would be "thrilled" to see others succeed with the model, he stresses that it is grueling and risky.</p><p>Beyond release strategy, AdHoc has also drawn attention for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-studio-weighs-in-on-the-ai-debate-in-gaming/1100-6536310/" data-ref-id="1100-6536310">rejecting AI as a replacement for creative roles.</a> "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one," said creative director Nick Herman. "Maybe it's a creative one if you aren't creative."</p>

                <p>Nintendo enthusiasts believe that an announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> DLC is imminent, though it takes a few steps to reach that conclusion.</p><p>Evidence, fans believe, stems from datamined information from the Nintendo Today app, which shares daily bite-sized pieces of news and offers several themes based on various Nintendo franchises. A new Donkey Kong theme came to the app recently, and per datamines (which you can see on <a href="https://www.mariowiki.com/Nintendo_Today!#Donkey_Kong" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Wiki</a>), it looks like the app will highlight a character that had a surprise appearance in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p><em>Spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza to follow!</em></p><p>An intro animation for DK's nemesis, King K. Rool, is purportedly set to feature in the Nintendo Today app on December 15. It'll be the first time Nintendo officially acknowledges his presence in Bananza, since his role was a big plot twist in the game. So, how does that relate to Mario Kart World DLC?</p><p>Back when Mario Kart World launched alongside the Nintendo Switch 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Mario/comments/1m336wn/dk_bananza_spoiler_is_dk_bananzas_credits/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sharp-eyed players noticed</a> that the Japanese voice performers for K. Rool and Bananza boss Void Kong appeared in the credits, despite their characters not appearing in the kart racer. While it's possible that the two voice actors played different roles in the base game, fans took it as evidence that a Donkey Kong Bananza-themed expansion is coming to Mario Kart World.</p><p>The timing of K. Rool's Nintendo Today animation rolling out a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards 2025 streams</a> on December 11 has fans trying to connect some dots, believing that putting K. Rool in the spotlight would tie in well with a possible DLC announcement at the awards show.</p><p>It isn't the most implausible theory--Nintendo has made announcements at The Game Awards in previous years, and the relatively paltry number of costumes for Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World leaves room for a big DK-centered expansion.</p><p>Whatever the outcome, Mario Kart fans are hungry for more. Despite being the marquee launch title for Switch 2, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">sales nearly matching those of the console itself</a>, there hasn't been any acknowledgement or hint of post-release content for Mario Kart World. At the very least, Nintendo has continued to update the game, most recently with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-update-out-now-adds-custom-item-rules-and-more/1100-6536657/" data-ref-id="1100-6536657">big patch that added features</a> like custom item rules.</p>
