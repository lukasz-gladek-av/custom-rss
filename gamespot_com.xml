                <p dir="ltr">In less than two weeks, a new cooperative horror game called REPO on Steam has gone from 7,000 concurrent players to hitting over 145,000 users on Valve's platform (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3241660/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>). To call the online-multiplayer experience a surprise hit is probably an understatement. This is only the second title from developer Semiwork, which previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304680/Voidigo/" rel="nofollow ">Voidigo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">REPO</a>re stands for retrieve, extract, and profit operation. As such, up to six people work together in the online cooperative game to attain valuable items as quietly as possible. That's easier than it sounds in the physics-based horror game, especially in a group setting with a "grabbing tool." But there are monsters listening and waiting to make everything even more chaotic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQ-kPtObmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="176">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1OQ-kPtObmQ?start=176" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Semiwork has called the burst in popularity for REPO "quite the experience," as it's the first time the studio has utilized the Unity engine as well as made an online multiplayer game. The developer is busy with new features, enemies, and levels for the horror game--as well as addressing bugs. Additionally, Semiwork is trying to figure out the best way to address hackers without implementing anti-cheat systems, since that could negatively affect players using mods.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, a couple of fun codes were dished out by Semiwork about REPO. For example, typing "/cinematic" in the text chat will remove the UI. Additionaly, the developer says you can put "/greenscreen" into the chat for that feature to pop up in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">REPO is $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Early Access</a>. The online cooperative horror game launched February 26.</p>

                <p>According to the CEO of The Lego Group, the company may begin developing some video games internally. Niels Christiansen, who has been Lego's CEO since 2017, said in an interview that the company is ramping up to make some games in-house.</p><p>"We can definitely say as long as we're under the Lego brand we can cover experiences for kids of all ages, digital or physical. [Games development in-house] is something we're building up," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FT</a>.</p><p>Many of the existing Lego games are made by external studios via a licensing arrangement. For example, Lego works with the UK studio <a href="https://www.ttgames.com/games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> on the popular Lego games based on brands like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>Lego is also in business with Epic Games for the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297"> Lego Fortnite game inside the Fortnite platform.</a> Additionally, Lego partnered with 2K for a racing game, 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-2k-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-585043">Lego 2K Drive</a>. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lego-is-starting-to-bring-its-game-development-in-house-key-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, this was the first in a series of sports games to come from this deal.</p><p>Reporter Jason Schreier said TT Games is now<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4?t=2997s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> developing a new Lego game</a> that could potentially release later in 2025 or in 2026. VGC reported that an upcoming Lego Harry Potter game may be in the works and could follow a similar format to Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga and cover the entire Harry Potter series. 2024's Lego Harry Potter Collection already did this, with the bundle comprising Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 and Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7. Warner Bros. Games is making major changes going forward and will focus only on a few core franchises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wbs-gaming-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6529747/" data-ref-id="1100-6529747">Harry Potter being one of them. </a></p><p>Another new release in the Lego game series was 2024's Lego Horizon Adventures, which adapted the events of Sony's Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo developed this title.</p><p>There is basically nothing to go on beyond Christiansen's single-sentence quote about potentially making games in-house, so it's not clear why the company might make this change, when it could happen, or if anything will change with Lego's ongoing business partnerships with outside studios.</p>

                <p>Wargaming, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a>, confirmed that its new mech shooter Steel Hunters will enter early access on April 2.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steel-hunters/" data-ref-id="5000-654971">Steel Hunters</a> was revealed at The Game Awards 2024. It's quite different from the military-focused multiplayer games Wargaming is best known for, such as World of Tanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warships/" data-ref-id="5000-114101">World of Warships</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warplanes/" data-ref-id="5000-107489">World of Warplanes</a>. Steel Hunters fully embraces sci-fi as a mecha game that blends elements from hero shooters, battle royales, and extraction shooters. Five teams of two players fight each other to collect a resource called Starfall on Earth, and players can win by killing all of their opponents or successfully extracting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1_2h0I6wvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Steel Hunters enters early access, it will include seven different "Hunters" for players to choose from: Razerside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet, and Weaver. Three maps scattered around Earth--Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights, and Stonecutter Keeper--will also be part of Steel Hunters from the start of Early Access.</p><p>Wargaming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=32977250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained in a Steam post</a> that it chose to put Steel Hunters through early access because it allows the developers and players to "we can refine and expand the game together, ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned." While Wargaming has not outlined a specific early access timeline, it also explained that the studio's goal "is to move quickly to a full release once your feedback has helped us polish the core experience."</p><p>Steel Hunters' early-access period will begin on April 2, exclusively on PC. It will be available on both Steam and the Wargaming Game Center storefronts.</p>
