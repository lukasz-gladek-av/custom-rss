                <p>In 2025, you're spoilt for choice when it comes to gaming, as more and more top quality titles are being released one after the other. Developer Sandfall Interactive faced an unusual and unexpected challenge, as Bethesda announced and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">Oblivion Remastered </a>just days before the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot ahead of the release, Ben Starr, who voices the mysterious character of Verso in the game, said this isn't actually a bad thing at all, despite challenges that the small studio of just 30 developers may face. "I think when it comes to that, one thing that we can absolutely speak to is how exciting it is that we're in 2025--a year that, whatever your gaming tastes, whether you're obsessed with Blue Prince, whether you're obsessed with Oblivion, whether you're excited for Doom: The Dark Ages, whether you're excited for Clair Obscur, you have so much diversity to explore. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481297"></a><figcaption>Starr voices the mysterious Verso in Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481297-clair-obscur-interview%281%29.jpg"></figure><p><span>"I think Expedition 33 is this amazing new IP that doesn't come along very often. You've got two ends of the spectrum. You've got the remake of the masterpiece that is Oblivion, the juggernaut that is Oblivion, and you've got this new IP that is Expedition 33, and hopefully they can exist alongside each other," he explains.</span></p><p>"I know that they can, because there is so much space in the industry to enjoy it. This game isn't going anywhere. This game is on Game Pass. Download it, put it on your console, and experience it when you get there. Genuinely, what a great year for videogames." </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481299"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur's story is warm and endearing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4481299-clairobscur_expedition33_castreveal1-49screenshot.png"></figure><p><span>When we asked Starr whether he'd be diving into Oblivion any time soon, he confirmed that it's certainly on his to-do list. "We're so lucky because we have a world where we are reinventing, not reimagining, and bringing old games to the fore. It's amazing for those who didn't get to play Oblivion. I look forward to playing it, I have it downloaded. At the same time, I'm deep in Clair Obscur. I'm a huge, huge fan of both."</span></p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's release will certainly be bolstered by the reviews it received a day before launching. With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rpg-is-a-contender-for-2025s-best-game-and-its-not-the-one-you-think/1100-6531061/" data-ref-id="1100-6531061">Metacritic score </a>of 92, it's tied with Blue Prince for the best-reviewed game of 2025 so far. Our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur review </a>calls it "a phenomenal RPG" that "that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye." </p>

                <p>Console commands are a part of the very fabric that makes up Bethesda RPGs. While they're exclusive to the PC versions of games, console commands offer players a way to gain a small, or large, edge during their playthrough. The original Oblivion featured a laundry list of console commands, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Oblivion Remastered</a> has brought all of them back.</p><p>Some console commands are fairly harmless in Cyrodiil, while others can completely alter your playthrough. You can activate god mode to rain down hellfire on the citizens of the country, or simply add some items to your inventory that you need for a quest. In any case, you can see a complete list of every console command and how to use them in Oblivion Remastered below. Naturally, for much more on the game, refer to our complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_use_console_commands_in_Oblivion_Remastered">How to use console commands in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>First up, let's talk about how to use console commands. As previously mentioned, <strong>this is a PC-only feature</strong> in Oblivion Remastered, so PlayStation and Xbox players will have to sit this one out.</p><p>PC players can follow the steps below to activate console commands:</p><ul><li>Once you're in-game, press the tilde (~) key, next to the 1 key, on your keyboard</li><li>This brings up the console command menu, which is a large black text box that has a repeating line at the bottom of it</li><li>The repeating line indicates where you can type in your console command</li><li>To use a console command, simply type it in exactly as it appears in the list below, press Enter, and your cheat will activate</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481286"></a><figcaption>The console command text box in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4481286-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.23-13.05.43.23.png"></figure><p>As you'll see when you bring up the console command menu, <strong>achievements become disabled if you use any kind of cheat</strong>.

In the list below, you'll see each console command itself and its description. You must type the console command exactly as it appears in the list when you activate it in-game. If you put even a space where it's not supposed to be, the console command won't work.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Console Command</th><th scope="col">In-game

playthrough. Adding and removing items from your inventory, messing with enemies, and changing your level, skills, and attributes will likely be the commands you use the most frequently, though.</p>

                <p>The NBA is collaborating with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765" data-mce-href="/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> once again, this year dropping a pair of new NBA-themed skins based on Axo and Fishstick. In this drop, the fan-favorite Fortnite characters are sporting jackets that feature the team logos from either the Eastern or Western Conferences as style options, and their heads have been redesigned slightly to make them look like basketballs. This new set will hit the item shop on Thursday.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266" data-ratio="0.5624607658506" data-width="1593" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481266"></a><figcaption>What the new NBA cosmetics look like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4481266-fortnitenbaanimals.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to the skins themselves, the new set of cosmetics includes two back blings, two pickaxes, and two emotes--and it'll reportedly be available all in one bundle. The highlight here may well be one of the back blings, actually. There's a mini jumbotron back bling in the set that counts your kills during a round, and lights up and plays arena organ music every time you defeat an enemy player. That back bling will be available to buy on its own for 400 V-Bucks.</p><p>The bundle that includes everything will <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1915059214575079746" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost 2200 V-Bucks</a>, with each of the skins costing 1200 separately. The pickaxes are 500 each, and the emotes will be 300 each.</p><p>The NBA's collaboration with Fortnite began years ago with <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=4771" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=4771" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">customizable players skins</a> that let you pick which team's uniform you want to wear. But those skins haven't been sold in the item shop since 2022--since a number of those uniforms are now outdated, those probably will not be coming back. Instead, Fortnite has dropped three waves of other NBA-themed skins, including the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=6397" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75th anniversary defaults</a>, the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=12139" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cel-shaded skins</a> that use fake team logos, and now these basketball re-dos of Axo and Fishstick.</p><p>It's been a busy month for Fortnite collaborations, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417" data-mce-href="/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/" data-ref-id="1100-6530777" data-mce-href="/articles/heres-what-the-adventure-time-fortnite-skins-look-like/1100-6530777/">Adventure Time</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/" data-ref-id="1100-6530911" data-mce-href="/articles/looks-like-cody-rhodes-and-the-undertaker-are-the-next-wwe-fortnite-skins/1100-6530911/">two new WWE wrestlers</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/" data-ref-id="1100-6531017" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-adds-new-tmnt-skins-featuring-casey-jones-and-iconic-villains/1100-6531017/">four new TMNT characters</a>, these NBA skins, and, next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/" data-ref-id="1100-6530990" data-mce-href="/articles/fortnite-is-finally-getting-winter-soldier-skin-and-a-white-widow-skin-you-can-earn-free/1100-6530990/">Marvel's Winter Soldier and White Widow</a>.

                <p>Reviews for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> have dropped, and it's now right up there with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-prince/" data-ref-id="5000-530468">Blue Prince</a> as one of the best-reviewed games of 2025.</p><p>Looking at <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot sister site Metacritic</a>, you'll see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 shares an aggregate Metascore of 92 with Blue Prince. Upon further investigation the individual pages for each game, though, you'll see that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a Metascore of 95 on Xbox Series X|S, 91 on PC, and 92 on PS5, while Blue Prince has a 92 on PC, 84 on PS5, and 89 on Xbox. That gives Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a slight edge, even though it's technically <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-highest-rated-game-of-2025-is-one-you-might-not-know/1100-6530673/" data-ref-id="1100-6530673">tied with Blue Prince</a> on Metacritic's best-reviewed games list.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWZ-xf1dslw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RWZ-xf1dslw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's an impressive feat for the first game from the new studio Sandfall Interactive. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a new turn-based RPG inspired by classics in the genre. It's set in a world where everyone above a certain age dies when a number is painted in the sky, and players set off as part of the titular expedition in hopes of defeating the Paintress behind this. Its provocative story and intense RPG gameplay really resonated with critics, including GameSpot's own.</p><p>"This is a supremely confident game that reinterprets familiar mechanics with an imaginative eye, Richard Wakeling wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">GameSpot's very positive review</a>. "Its combat is a consistent delight, delivering thrills with thoughtful strategy and reactive action in equal measure, complementing a heartfelt story of shared grief and camaraderie."</p><p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> also dropped this week and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">threatened to overshadow</a> Sandfall's debut, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is proving to be the can't-miss RPG of this month. It launches tomorrow, April 24, for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S and will be part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate catalog from day one.</p>
