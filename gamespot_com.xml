                <p>Backbone has revealed its new limited-edition controller for smartphones, and for fans of classic Xbox vibes, this could be a very nostalgic device for mobile gaming. The Backbone One: Xbox Edition controller will go on sale starting March 27 at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET. Since this will be sold in limited quantities, it'll be available exclusively through the <a href="https://backbone.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone store</a> and <a href="https://howl.link/8067al4hlgeap?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17430825347459?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

It's a darker shade of green that references the classic aesthetic of Xbox, and it includes a black PCB and the iconic Xbox button. Beyond that, you're getting the standard range of inputs that you'll find on other Backbone controllers, allowing you to play games with a traditional selection of controls.</p><p>This is also a second-gen model, so you're getting a USB-C connection that can pair with your phone, even if it's protected by a phone case. This makes the Backbone controller quite appealing as you won't need to strip the protective cover off of your phone every time you want to use it. Additionally, there is passthrough charging, a 2.5mm headphone jack, and support for most iPhones and Android devices.</p><p>If you're looking to pair this with other devices, 8BitDo also launched a mechanical keyboard and mouse that are also equipped with transparent green shells. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMTLLSBN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox-inspired transparent green keyboard</a> is on sale for the first time since its release earlier this year and the matching <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DMVLD2HC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro R8 Wireless Gaming Mouse is priced at $60</a>.</p><h2>Backbone One controllers</h2><p>In case it sells out, you can grab a Backbone controller for your phone in either a carbon-black color scheme inspired by the Xbox Series X console or a PlayStation white version. As mentioned above, the second-gen models feature USB-C connections, but if you're using an older iPhone, you can get a first-gen model equipped with a Lightning port.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2TJW4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, USB-C, Black)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $98</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09ZXTRKQ9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RL7VLKY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (1st Gen, Lightning, Black)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>When it first released, our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-one-controller-review/1100-6491699/" data-ref-id="1100-6491699">Backbone One review</a> praised the controller for being a "combination of solid hardware and smart app design" that has only gotten better with its second-generation update.

                <p>In the early '80s, the Commodore 64 was at the forefront of the home computer revolution. Now, retro publisher Ziggurat Interactive is bringing back a selection of the classic games from the C64 era in Cosmi: Forbidden Forests, which will also include a new remaster of Forbidden Forests.</p><p>1983's Forbidden Forest and its 1985 sequel, Beyond the Forbidden Forest, are both included in this compilation. But the primary attraction of Cosmi: Forbidden Forests is the modernized version of the title game that transforms the 2D art style into something that resembles a medieval tapestry. Players will have the option of toggling between the original style of Forbidden Forests and the new graphics and audio. A glimpse of the remaster is included in the announcement trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDu0WSdbhww" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nDu0WSdbhww" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The remaining games included in this retro release include Aztec Challenge, Caverns of Khafka, Seal, Delta Man, Chomp!, Chernobyl: Nuclear Power Plant Simulation, Spite &amp; Malice, and Navcom 6: The Persian Gulf Defense. These titles retain their C64 style graphics and gameplay, while adding features like the ability to rewind the action or create save states.</p><p>Comic-book veterans Ant Williams and Andy Lanning's Ideas &amp; Inks provided the compilation's new box art, and oversaw a collection of digital comics based on Forbidden Forests and Caverns of Khafka. This package also includes a digital gallery of the manuals that came with the games as well as their promotional art from the '80s.</p><p>Cosmi: Forbidden Forests will be released on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on May 27.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently made headlines when he told fans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-bet-on-there-being-a-last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6529927/" data-ref-id="1100-6529927">not bet on the developer making The Last of Us 3</a>. Now, he's clarified those comments, saying "so many stars have to align" for any given project to come to market, so he can't guarantee anything as it relates to future Last of Us projects.</p><p>Speaking to CTV's Etalk, Druckmann said, "Every project I work on I treat it like it could be my last. I just pour everything into it and leave nothing on the table."</p><p>He added: "When we did the first Last of Us game, that's how I treated it--I wasn't sure I could ever get to make a sequel. It had to have a definitive ending. Likewise when I worked on Uncharted 4--same thing. [Same for] when I worked on The Last of Us 2--I was like, 'I don't know if I'll ever get to do this again.' It had this definitive ending."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvIqzhEkNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcvIqzhEkNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The ending in The Last of Us: Part II is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-has-an-ending-in-mind-for-the-last-of-us-tv-series/1100-6530415/" data-ref-id="1100-6530415">what Druckmann is working toward for the overall series</a>, whether it ends with the TV show or another game, he said.</p><p>"For there to be another [game], another thing, another project. So many stars have to align, so I can't guarantee it. Right now, my focus is on this season; hopefully if HBO renews us, next season. And then I am working on a new game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.

                <p>The folks working on Balatro have let us know how to properly pronounce the game's title, even though there's no real "wrong" way to do so.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, publisher PlayStack's head of video marketing Naman Budhwar said, "'BAH-luh-trow' is how local folks say it, but it's kind of a 'gif' and 'jif' situation where [LocalThunk] doesn't really mind how people say it."
