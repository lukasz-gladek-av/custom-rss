                <p>An update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on launch day makes a couple key changes to the game's shrines, preventing players from destroying certain items in them. The patch comes amid a discussion about cultural sensitivity in the 16th-century Japan game.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-japan-concern-about-assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-confirms-day-one-patch-that-makes-tables-and-racks-in-temples-and-shrines-indestructible" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to IGN</a>, the update changes the game so that the monks inside of the shrines no longer bleed when attacked, while tables and racks throughout the game's temples and shrines are now indestructible. Bowls and drums can be broken, however, and tables can be moved and pushed.</p><p>Earlier this week, Japan's Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba responded to a question about Assassin's Creed Shadows and its shrines. He said, as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-prime-minister-of-japan-responded-to-a-question-about-assassins-creed-shadows-today-heres-whats-actually-going-on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, that "defacing a shrine is out of the question--it is an insult to the nation itself. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them."</p><p>Hiroyuki Kada, a Japanese politician, said he fears that if people can vandalize a shrine in Assassin's Creed Shadows, it might "encourage similar behavior in real life."</p><p>"Shrine officials and local residents are also worried about this. Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided," he said.</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/shoheikondo/status/1885391745854173688" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">viral video posted earlier this year</a> showed a player running through a shrine and causing havoc. This was not an objective of any specific quest, but instead the player choosing to do this.</p><p>In July 2024, Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">put out a statement</a> in which it said Shadows is a work of fiction, and one that Ubisoft enlisted the help of external consultants, historians, and researchers as part of an effort to "inform our creative choices." Ubisoft also acknowledged that some of the game's promotional materials at the time "caused concern within the Japanese community," and for that, Ubisoft said, "We sincerely apologize."</p><p>Shadows is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, featuring the protagonists <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-or-naoe-switch-characters/2900-6333/" data-ref-id="2900-6333">Naoe and Yasuke</a>.
