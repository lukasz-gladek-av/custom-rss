He conjured up an impressive Rube Goldberg track that sees the mustached plumber winning a race full of pencils, strings, an ironing board, and even a moving green shell.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybSLWd0MH4">On YouTube</a>, Herscher shared his impressive Mario Kart creation on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JosephsMachines">Joseph's Machines channel</a>. The race is viewed twice in the video--seen below--from different camera perspectives. Donkey Kong faces a pretty terrible fate in the race, and how Mario overtakes Baby Luigi at the end is so cool.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybSLWd0MH4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cybSLWd0MH4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">The Mario Kart Lego kits</a> came out a couple of months ago, with six different options available.

Battlefield's lead producer, David Sirland, has now reacted to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-dev-reacts-to-games-many-leaks-i-am-not-ok-with-leaks/1100-6530040/" data-ref-id="1100-6530040">many leaks</a> that have come out of the Battlefield Labs test, saying he doesn't plan to discuss specifics of the private test. He added that while fan feedback is appreciated and helpful to DICE, this feedback isn't the sole driver of changes planned for the game's release.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/with_replies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Sirland reminded fans that Battlefield Labs "exists for a reason," and that reason is to allow the developers at DICE to refine the experience ahead of launch. Any footage that has leaked out of the tests is not necessarily representative of the game that fans will one day play.</p><p>"This BF may look to play one way, but I assure you it also has many layers you need to play to perceive," Sirland said. "A key reason (outside of making a BF everyone wants to play) to use something like Labs. Allowing us as devs to find the best possible outcome of our designs--together."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1828434486" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

The team is now working on a single-player action-adventure game called Crimson Desert, which uses the same custom Black Desert game engine specifically designed for the first game.

high fantasy continent called Pywel. My tour through the open world via a dev kit included examples of cloth and hair reacting to changing wind direction, shadows moving in conjunction to multiple light sources of various intensities, and various degrees of severity when it came to different weather conditions, all of which influenced NPCs and certain elements (like water and wind) to behave in a believable way.</span></p><p dir="ltr">You'll laugh, but the aspect of the walkthrough that impressed me the most was watching a horse get drenched in water. I haven't seen anything like either before in any video game. As I watched protagonist Kliff ride through a stream while on horseback, Pearl Abyss showcased how only the parts of the horse that actually touched the water remained wet after leaving the stream. I've seen plenty of video game characters enter water and leave with their clothes still drenched, but I've never seen a game reflect whether only a horse's hooves got wet, or only the legs--I even saw the horse only get partially submerged, and the game accurately reflected on the horse how drenched they got instead of reverting to a fully-drenched state.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463511"></a><figcaption>This is just a remarkably pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4463511-ss_debaa53e71b6890d00bcc19254c453d997d333b1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Does any of this have anything to do with how fun Crimson Desert will be? Presumably not, and since I didn't get a chance to play the game, I can't speak to what the gameplay feels like--I saw a smidge of combat and exploration in action, though, and both looked pretty cool). But the Black Desert engine is a lot more detailed than Black Desert Online led me to believe, and it feels like Pearl Abyss is really pushing it through its paces for this game to create as immersive an experience as the team can. For those who like to just <em>exist </em>in the world of an RPG and appreciate how even the smallest of details are considered, Crimson Desert might be the game to watch this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Crimson Desert is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in late 2025. The game sees you play as Kliff, a mercenary who finds himself repeatedly dragged into conflicts that threaten to plunge the world of Pywel and its people into chaos.</p>

                <p>A new God of War game is reportedly going to be released this year, and it's apparently a side-story involving Greece.</p><p>According to Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-god-of-war-side-story-project-set-in-greece-is-coming-this-year-its-claimed/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a>, the game is a brand-new title and not a remaster collection. It'll focus on Greek mythology rather than the Norse mythology found in God of War (2018) and Ragnarok. It's unclear what "side-story" means, but it's possible that it could be referring to a smaller kind of game that's too big to be standalone DLC. Examples include Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. God of War previously got several Greek-focused prequels, including two PSP games and God of War: Ascension on PS3.</p><p>The first three God of War games focused on Greek mythology.

                <p>Palworld, the Pokemon-like game that became very popular in 2024 and led to a lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, has never been released for the Nintendo Switch. But could the game make its way to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>? We don't know, but Pocketpair's communications director, John Buckley, said in an interview that technical reasons are to blame for Palworld's absence on Switch so far.</p><p>"If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is expected to have better specs, but Buckley said Pocketpair has not "seen those specs yet" for the upcoming console.</p><p>"Like everyone else, we're waiting," he said. "If [the Switch 2 is] beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering," he said. "We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p><p>It's also an open question as to whether or not Nintendo would permit Pocketpair to release Palworld on Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-launches-new-game-on-switch-in-middle-of-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6528719/#:~:text=Palworld%20developer%20Pocketpair%20has%20launched,tower%20defense%2C%20and%20roguelike%20elements." data-ref-id="1100-6528719">Pocketpair's Overdungeon launched on Switch earlier this year</a> amid the lawsuit against Nintendo and The Pokemon Company.</p><p>Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing Pocketpair for patent infringement related to mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD).</a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/huge-palworld-update-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-new-pal-storage/1100-6530211/" data-ref-id="1100-6530211">Palworld just got a huge new update that added, among other things, cross-play and a photo mode</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows hit shelves at a crucial point in Ubisoft's history, with some analysts going so far as to call it an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-is-bit-of-an-existential-moment-for-ubisoft-analyst-says/1100-6530208/">existential moment</a>" for the company. If reported player counts are any indication, Ubisoft's prayers may indeed be answered thanks to the Assassins Order's latest adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft itself reported two million players have entered the AC version of feudal Japan since the game's launch on March 20. While two million players does not equate to two million copies sold--Shadows is available to Ubisoft+ subscribers, for example--the social media post announcing the feat said that Shadows "surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey." Meanwhile, Christopher Dring of GamesIndustry.biz has reported that <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shadows is "comfortably ahead"</a> of Monster Hunter Wilds for biggest physical release in the UK this year.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🔥 2 MILLION PLAYERS! 🔥<br>We’re thrilled to celebrate this incredible milestone! <br>Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey.

This breaks the all-time concurrent record for a single Assassin's Creed game, which according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/franchise/Assassin%27s+Creed/?sort=peak_desc" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB's data</a> was previously held by Assassin's Creed Odyssey's 62,000 users when it launched in 2018.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has found itself in dire straits in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/">company stock sinking to its worst figure in a decade</a> after the underwhelming launch of Star Wars Outlaws last summer. Rumors have swirled regarding a sale of both the company and its individual franchises, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/">Microsoft, and EA</a> said to be in the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest in Ubisoft's popular historical-fiction series, Assassin's Creed Shadows follows the samurai Yasuke and ninja Assassin Naoe as they battle the Templar Order in 16th-century Japan. Players can switch between the two Assassins and their unique playing styles to complete missions, with swords, daggers, naginata, and more weapons at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
