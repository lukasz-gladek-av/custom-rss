                <p dir="ltr">Each month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> players take part in the mobile game's Community Day: A recurring monthly event in which one Pokemon takes center stage and becomes available to catch in its Shiny form. January's Community Day Pokemon is Sprigatito, but players who want to get their hands on this grassy feline familiar will find themselves paying double the cost of past Community Day events.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, a Community Day Ticket was available to purchase in-game for just $1, but as of this month, that price is doubling to $2. The ticket does include a new reward (a battle pass), but Pokemon Go battle passes can often be found in bundled pairs that cost less.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes have been made to Community Day as well, but Pokemon Go developer Niantic says these changes may not be permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">"Starting with January Community Day, get ready to experience new free Timed Research, paid Special Research, and rare Field Research as you search for the featured Pok√©mon with Season-exclusive Special Backgrounds in Pokemon GO: Dual Destiny," reads an official <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/communityday-january-2025-sprigatito/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">blog post detailing January Community Day</a>. "We're trying out new things for Community Day and will reevaluate these changes for next season and onward."</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear if the Community Day Ticket price will be included among the changes Niantic may reevaluate in the future.</p><p>The January Community Day event is scheduled for Sunday, January 5 from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM local time.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds. It may rouse excitement from time to time, but by and large, it lacks a pervading sense of artistry, both in its level design and presentation."</p>

                <p>If you've ever wondered about your skill level in Call of Duty, you now have a way to find out. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> players have discovered a way to get Activision to provide their previously hidden SBMM ratings, and it's really easy.</p><p>TheXclusiveAce has shared the method on his YouTube channel, which lays out the simple steps to get your personalized SBMM report going back to 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-vanguard-review-personnel-problems/1900-6417780/" data-ref-id="1900-6417780">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a>. As noted by TheXclusiveAce, each report includes some highly personal data including your IP address, so think twice before sharing it unedited.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6Zw8tADVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dZ6Zw8tADVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get access, the first step is to visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's privacy page</a> and login to your Activision account. TheXclusiveAce also mentioned that he had to login to his PSN account as well. After that, submit a personal information access request. Prior to the video above, the wait time was around a day before Activision e-mailed the file out. But since this method is now widely known, there may be additional delays.</p><p>The report itself is a very through examination of each player's Call of Duty history, as it tracks every match played, as well as the mode, the operator who was used, the number of hits taken, the longest streak, and more. It's a lot to take in. The report also charts the course of each player's skill ranking as it rises or falls depending upon their activities in the games.</p><p>SBMM ratings are used to place Call of Duty players in lobbies with similarly skilled players, as determined by Activision's criteria. Not every player may agree with these assessments, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-player-pleads-with-call-of-duty-to-put-him-in-the-trash-lobbies/1100-6528596/" data-ref-id="1100-6528596">NBA's Donovan Mitchell recently pleaded with Activision</a> to put him "in the trash lobbies." Over time, it's possible that the most experienced Call of Duty players may be able to utilize the info in their player reports to enhance their ratings.</p><p>Recently, Activision debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">a stoner-lizard DLC</a> for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-patch-notes-increase-xp-earn-rates-for-bo6-and-fix-a-broken-operator-in-warzone/1100-6528419/" data-ref-id="1100-6528419">a new patch for Black Ops 6</a> that's meant to address other issues in the game as well. Meanwhile, Treyarch unveiled a collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-collab-for-black-ops-6-and-warzone/1100-6528158/" data-ref-id="1100-6528158">Black Ops 6 and Netflix's Squid Game</a>.</p>

                <p>Marvel Rivals developer NetEase has apologized to rightfully pissed-off players who were unfairly banned for cheating. The problem is even though they were not using cheating software, this resulted in false bans. NetEase failed to say how many.</p><p>NetEase said (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-dev-apologizes-for-mistakenly-banning-players-for-using-cheats" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) that it admitted it had mistakenly flagged some players who were playing in compatibility layer programs as cheaters. "We sincerely apologize for this situation and want to assure you that we do not and will not ban players who are playing fairly and without cheating," NetEase said. "We have identified the specific reasons behind these false bans and have compiled a list of affected players. We have lifted these bans and want to express our heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience this has caused."</p><p>NetEase continued that it is investing in improving its anti-cheat, and called on players to report cheaters if they encounter them.</p><p>"Our mission is to provide all players with a fair, just, and enjoyable gaming environment. Therefore, preventing and identifying cheaters is one of our top priorities. We have invested significant manpower and resources to improve the speed and accuracy of our detection systems," the developers added. "With any ongoing detection system, there is always room for improvement. We appreciate your assistance in helping us tackle this challenge. If you encounter any cheating behavior, please report it immediately; our reporting system will respond promptly. If you believe you have been wrongly banned, you can appeal to our customer support team, and we will review your case and respond in a timely manner. You can reach the support team via either in-game or in Discord!"</p><p>The news comes ahead of Marvel Rivals Season 1 and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">arrival of Fantastic Four playable characters</a> who were teased with a first-look image with a soon-to-be-released trailer. Fingers crossed for HERBIE to be added as well.</p><p>While this might have annoyed some players, Marvel Rivals has been a stellar hit for NetEase, reporting 10 million players in three days <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">and 20 million in two weeks</a>. Over on Steam, Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in the top five most-played games on Valve's platform.</p>

                <p>According to a veteran video game industry analyst, 2025 could be the year that Microsoft goes "all-in" on bringing its Xbox games to other platforms, including PlayStation 5. Microsoft, of course, has already begun to launch some games on rival platforms, but Serkan Toto of Kantan Games believes Microsoft will lean further into that this year.</p><p>Toto told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-finally-gta-6-to-dominate-ai-in-game-dev-again-analysts-predictions-for-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft may opt to do this for a variety of reasons, including helping to pay for its massive buyout of Activision Blizzard and the "huge lead" of PlayStation in the market.</p><p>"2025 might be the year where they go all-in," Toto said. "The $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal, rising costs across the board, the power of forever-titles, the huge lead of Sony, and other factors will likely leave Microsoft no choice but to bring all their big games to PS5 early, including blockbusters such as Gears of War: E-Day or Perfect Dark."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="495614030" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

including Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Hi-Fi Rush, and Pentiment. Even before this, though, Microsoft was already one of the biggest publishers on PlayStation and Switch thanks to the juggernaut Minecraft series. Call of Duty is now a Microsoft franchise, too, and Microsoft continues to release the game on PlayStation platforms.</p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p>
