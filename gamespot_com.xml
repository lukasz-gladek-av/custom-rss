                <p>What does a day in the life of billionaire gaming boss Gabe Newell look like? Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">Zalkar Saliev</a> from one of his yachts, the Valve co-founder said he enjoys the benefit of living on a boat while maintaining a fairly regular work schedule.</p><p>"I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, work some more, [then] either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. I live on a boat so I just hang out with everybody on the boat. Then I work," he said, and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> confirmed with Valve that this interview is real. "I work seven days a week: I'm working from my bedroom as you can tell. I like working, it's fun, to me it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super-awesome."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbvWCKMpSHQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qbvWCKMpSHQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Newell said the traditional idea of retirement is that you "stop doing your horrible job and go do what is most fun and entertaining," and in that sense, he said he feels like he's been retired for a while.</p><p>"I've said it before but, when you retire, you want to like stop doing your horrible job and go do what is sort of most fun and entertaining," says Newell. "In that sense I've been retired for a long time.</p><p>In addition to his responsibilities at Valve, Newell started the neural interface company Starfish Neuroscience, a competitor to Elon Musk's Neuralink. He's also working with a company that is creating an "aerosol pathogen detection device" that reveals what pathogens may be in the air.</p><p>"I just work all the time," he said. "But it's not like, 'Oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like, 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun,' you know?"</p><p>Newell dropped out of Harvard in the early '80s to join Microsoft, <a href="https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-millionaires-unleashed-12-ex-194415077.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaving the company as a millionaire</a> with Mike Harrington to form Valve. He's now a billionaire, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/gabe-newell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Forbes estimating his net worth at $9.5 billion.</a> Despite his immense riches, he still gets out there and talks to fans, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-gabe-newell-personally-hand-deliver-steam-decks/1100-6501106/" data-ref-id="1100-6501106">he personally delivered Steam Decks back in 2022.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The current gaming industry is filled with remakes and remasters; some of them are faithful to their source material, while others are more open to changing things around when needed. It's not too often that the original creator of a remade work speaks about a modern reimagining, but recently the co-creator of Crash Bandicoot took to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_in-my-opinion-key-word-opinion-the-crash-activity-7350944750100762624-wc29/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADS31r4B5UCbzMu8ZKusxOGCydRRQic55jc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> to give his thoughts on 2017's N. Sane Trilogy--and the "most important 30 milliseconds" worth of change that made a world of difference.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/crash-bandicoot/crash-bandicoot-co-creator-says-the-remake-got-almost-everything-right-except-the-most-important-30-milliseconds-and-thats-why-it-feels-worse-than-the-1996-original/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, Naughty Dog co-founder Andrew Gavin posted a wide range of thoughts about the modern remasters of Crash Bandicoot 1-3, While he says the games "nailed the visuals" and said they "looked great [and] faithful to the original," in his mind, things went south when it came to jumping--or, as he put it, the team "completely botched how jumping works."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533892"></a><figcaption>That polar bear is just happy to see Crash, right?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533892-crash.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The original game, Gavin explains, read how long the player held the jump button down and measured Crash's jump accordingly--the longer a player held the button, the higher Crash jumped. This mechanic was lost in the N. Sane Trilogy, according to Gavin, and replaced with a system when every jump is always the maximum height possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"The remake developers either didn't notice this system or thought it wasn't important," Gavin's post said. "They reverted to simple fixed jumps, [and] then realized Crash couldn't make half the jumps in the game. Their solution was to make all jumps maximum height."</p><p dir="ltr">This solution, according to Gavin, fundamentally changed how jumping in the remaster worked, to the game's detriment. "Now every jump on the remake is huge and floaty. Those precise little hops between platforms are awkward," Gavin wrote. "The game's fundamental jumping mechanic feels worse than the 1996 original despite running on hardware that's 1000x more powerful."</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to try the altered jumping for yourself, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is available now for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

Both GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a> and the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wider critical space</a> have plenty of praise to heap on the game. If you're diving in soon, you'll want to know how long it takes to beat Donkey Kong Bananza. We have that information, along with the game's chapter list, right here for you.</p><h2>How long is Donkey Kong Bananza?</h2><p>DK's latest banana-fuelled quest will differ greatly in length depending on how committed you are to finding all of its collectibles, completing optional challenges, and exploring the many sublayers of its mining-focused world. For a typical player--someone who beats the game through to the final boss and does <em>some</em> optional objectives, you're looking at <strong>a playthrough of 15-20 hours</strong>. However, there's more than one way to play, too.</p><p>For someone seeking out every last banana, Banandium Gem, challenge course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-transformations-in-donkey-kong-bananza-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6727/" data-ref-id="2900-6727">transformations</a>, and all Style Shop costumes for both DK and Paulina, <strong>a full 100% playthrough will run you closer to 50-60 hours</strong>. Careful, as there is such a thing as too much potassium.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533841" data-ratio="0.56242424242424" data-width="1650" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533841"></a><figcaption>Alongside Paulina, DK is once more in search of many, many bananas.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4533841-c111819ae2b07f446ab92d64c8d37e9ef8e541e30b687121fa6d5976096b61f9.jpg"></figure><h2>Donkey Kong Bananza chapter list</h2><p>The full run of levels and their encompassing missions is below. Note, however, that levels also have sublevels--and we mean that geographically, as you can often find yourself mining up or down through a level. These sublevels will house more optional objectives, and sometimes even main objectives, so you'll often find yourself in them naturally.</p><p>Beside each level, we've listed the total number of bananas found in it, totaling a whopping<strong> 777 across the whole game</strong>. You won't be able to nab all of these until the end of the game and into the post-game, as a lot is purposely blocked off until then. All 17 chapters in Donkey Kong Bananza are listed below in the order you'll encounter them.</p><ol><li>Ingot Isle Cave-in - SL1 - 36 bananas</li><li>Lagoon Layer - SL100 - 56 bananas</li><li>Hilltop Layer - SL200 - 38 bananas</li><li>Canyon Layer - SL300 - 80 bananas</li><li>The Divide - SL400 - 10 bananas</li><li>Freezer Layer - SL500 - 87 bananas</li><li>Forest Layer - SL600 - 83 bananas</li><li>The Junction - SL700 - 15 bananas</li><li>Resort Layer - SL800 - 42 bananas</li><li>Tempest Layer - SL900 - 70 bananas</li><li>Landfill Layer - SL1000 - 27 bananas</li><li>Racing Layer - SL1100 - 10 bananas</li><li>Radiance Layer - SL1200 - 76 bananas</li><li>Groove Layer - SL1300 - 30 bananas</li><li>Feast Layer - SL1400 - 69 bananas</li><li>Forbidden Layer - SL1500 - 25 bananas</li><li>Planet Core - SL1600 - 23 bananas</li></ol>

Call of Duty's in-game shop will feature bundles for the characters Stan Smith and Roger.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9B-hHTlLr-4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9B-hHTlLr-4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Stan Smith bundle goes live sometime later today, and Roger's bundle is scheduled to hit the shop July 20. Stan's bundle includes one operator skin and various cosmetics, while Roger's bundle is packed with three different skins for the character as well as additional items. Both bundles also feature operator voice lines, as previewed in the trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Prices aren't mentioned in this new announcement, but these operator packs will likely feature a price of 2,800 CoD Points ($25) for each bundle, which is the typical cost for most bundles in Call of Duty's big IP crossovers.</p><p dir="ltr">This American Dad crossover continues the cartoon theme of Season 4 Reloaded, which previously added cel-shaded maps and Beavis and Butt-Head as Call of Duty operators. It's also not too late to unlock this animated duo. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/">Beavis and Butt-Head event</a> is live until July 30, and there are free and premium rewards available to unlock. This includes free skins for Todd and Coach Buzzcut, and paid skins for both Beavis and Butt-Head.</p>

The Donkey Kong-themed model releases October 12, but with DK being all the craze nowadays, it probably doesn't hurt to lock in your order if you're interested. You won't be charged until it ships.</p><div title="6533233 - Donkey Kong Reveal Switch Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3912" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533233 - Donkey Kong Reveal Switch Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTQ6B37?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases October 12</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This controller is designed to work with Switch and Switch 2, though it lacks the C button for GameChat. Beyond that, it's fully compatible with the new hardware. Officially licensed by Nintendo, it offers up to 40 hours of play on a single charge, support for motion controls, two remappable back buttons, and an ergonomic design that should keep you comfortable during extended play sessions.</p><p>Overall, the Rematch is a good controller with well-rounded features and a solid build. There are better controllers for the price, but the main draw here is the striking artwork.</p><p>Covered in hues of green and black with red accents, it features DK and Diddy Kong racing through the jungle. The back buttons are red while the triggers are green, which should make it stand out in your game room. Its lenticular design means that, as you move the controller, the design will slowly morph, revealing new layers of detail. This is a fairly uncommon design feature--and one that makes it a bit more exciting than your standard gamepad.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680" data-ratio="0.40983606557377" data-width="1464" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533680"></a><figcaption>Turtle Beach Rematch Wireless Pro Controller: Donkey Kong Reveal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4533680-589bde2c-ef7b-488a-a777-cac8efe1.jpg"></figure><p>It's worth noting that the Rematch is already available in a handful of Super Mario-themed designs.
