Both of the launch maps feature a main storyline, and here we guide you through all the steps needed to complete the Liberty Falls main quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get started with the Liberty Falls main quest</h2><p dir="ltr">The Liberty Falls storyline quest can be completed either solo or with a squad, but some steps will be made easier with teammates.</p><p dir="ltr">First, you'll need to spend the first few rounds opening up the full map, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-unlock-and-use-pack-a-punch-on-liberty-falls/1100-6527380/">reaching Pack-a-Punch</a>, and crafting the map's Jetgun Wonder Weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've opened up the church's interior, you'll want to <strong>interact with the machine</strong> located on the right side. This will give you some story dialogue.</p><p dir="ltr">Interact with the machine in the room again, and you'll be prompted with the next steps to build the Wonder Wonder needed to progress.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Craft a Jetgun Wonder Weapon</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391655-wwcraftingbench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391655" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391655-wwcraftingbench.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391655"></a><figcaption>Jetgun crafting table in the Motel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391655-wwcraftingbench.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Liberty Falls features a new and improved version of the Jetgun from Black Ops 2's TranZit map, and this variant of the Wonder Weapon is much more satisfying to use and won't break on you.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few steps needed to collect all the parts, but we have a full guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-how-to-get-the-jetgun-wonder-weapon/1100-6527430/">how to craft the Jetgun here</a>. Alternatively, you can also get lucky and get the Jetgun from the Mystery Box, but your chances are slim.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Collect LTG Device parts</h2><p dir="ltr">The Jetgun is needed to reach the LTG parts that are all out of reach, by using the vacuuming function of the weapon. (Holding the right trigger)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391656-ltghat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391656" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391656-ltghat.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391656"></a><figcaption>LTG church part</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391656-ltghat.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Church part</h3><p dir="ltr">First, take the Jetgun to the church. Interact with the machine inside again. Then, look up by the balcony to find a part that looks like a floating hat. <strong>Vacuum up the hat</strong> with the Jetgun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391657-maineecomicshoppart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391657" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391657-maineecomicshoppart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391657"></a><figcaption>LTG part in comic book shop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391657-maineecomicshoppart.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Comic book shop part</h3><p dir="ltr">A second part can be found inside Ollie's comic shop. Head inside and look up. There's <strong>a part floating</strong> in the hole in the ceiling. Vacuum it up with the Jetgun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391659-ltgbarber.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391659-ltgbarber.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391659"></a><figcaption>LTG part in barbershop window</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391659-ltgbarber.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Barbershop part</h3><p dir="ltr">Another part can be found in the barbershop, which is near Speed Cola. You'll need to hop from the nearby rooftop to the top of the truck that's parked outside of the shop. This lets you vacuum the part out of the top-right window of the barbershop.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Build the LTG device</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391660"></a><figcaption>Build the LTG on bank rooftop</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391660-maineeltg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With all three LTG parts collected, you can now head to the bank's rooftop. Just unlock and use either the zipline or ascender connected to the roof. There is a special crafting bench on the roof just for this device.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the LTG device</h2><h3 dir="ltr">Grab an Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Head back into the church after building the LTG. Interact with the machine again to <strong>pick up an Aether canister</strong>. Whoever holds this item is going to be weighed down and moving slowly.</p><p dir="ltr">Take the canister to either of the two Dark Aether storms on the map. There's one at the Cemetery and another just right of the Pump and Pay gas station. The order doesn't matter here, but we'll start the guide at the gas station.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Collect an HVT essence</h3><p dir="ltr">Place your canister near the trap at the gas station. Then, interact with the trap piece located directly under the purple storm. Doing so will place the LTG device down.</p><p dir="ltr">This will spawn zombies for a 60-second window. You need to protect the device from taking damage from zombies during this time. Then, the device will turn red, and a portal will spawn the HVT. This enemy will be either a Mangler or an Abomination.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661" data-ratio="0.56214953271028" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391661"></a><figcaption>Mangler HVT at the gas station trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391661-maineemanglerhvt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You <strong>need to weaken but not kill</strong> the HVT right away. Get the health low and lead the HVT back to the canister you placed down near the trap. The HVT emits purple sparks when the health gets low enough. When this happens, you need to quickly activate the trap. You need to <strong>kill the HVT by the canister while the trap is still active</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HVT's essence now captured in the trap, you must collect that canister and carry it back to the church. <strong>This step is timed</strong> at 90 seconds, plus you still move slowly carrying it, so make haste toward the church.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Deposit the filled Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">Deposit this canister back into the machine inside the church. Once the canister is deposited, a tray on the machine will dispense a new item to pick up. This is called a Strauss Counter. Grab it.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Use the Strauss Counter</h2><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter is used to sync up three items on the map that look like old-school film projectors. Using the Strauss Counter is the same button prompt as activating your tactical equipment, and you'll want to activate it while standing beside each of these small devices.</p><p dir="ltr">The Strauss Counter will give you a color, which can be green, yellow, or red. Interact with the projector device on the ground until it matches the color shown on your Strauss Counter. Repeat this step for all three devices. These are found as follows:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391662"></a><figcaption>Device on hillside leading down to the bowling alley</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391662-maineehillsideprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Church hillside</h3><p dir="ltr">The closest one is on the hill leading down from the church to the bowling alley.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391663"></a><figcaption>Found behind the white house on the church street</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391663-maineewhitehouseprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Near tool shed</h3><p dir="ltr">Behind the white house on the church street, which is near the Groundskeeper's Tool Shed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391666"></a><figcaption>Rooftop device overlooking the gas station</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391666-maineerooftopprojector.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Bank rooftop</h3><p dir="ltr">On the lower portion of the bank's roof. Head to the main rooftop of the bank, and then drop down on the lower ledge.</p><p dir="ltr">Once all devices are synced up with the correct color, a purple beam will shoot out of them in the direction of the gas station. This marks the next place you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>This step was oddly buggy for my playthrough. All devices were synced to the corresponding color, but nothing happened. We ended up advancing the round, and then we tried to turn them all back to green to reset them. Once they all turned green, the devices powered up and worked. So, try this if they don't activate the color combo on the Strauss Counter.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Fill the second Aether canister</h3><p dir="ltr">A new Aether canister has spawned at the gas station. Pick it up.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, make sure to pick up the LTG Device off the trap where you left when you captured the first essence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391667"></a><figcaption>Place the canister next to the trap on the street downhill from the church</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4391667-maineechurchstreetcanisterlocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Take the LTG and the canister to the cemetery. This is the same process as before with the HVT. This will be either a Mangler or an Abomination, whichever you didn't get as an HVT the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">Place the canister near one of the cemetery traps, which is in the street outside the church, and then place the LTG on the trap piece under the storm. Fight off the zombies for 60 seconds at the LTG until the HVT spawns.</p><p dir="ltr">Weaken the HVT, but <strong>do not kill it right away</strong>. Make sure to lead it near the canister and trap it in the street. This HVT should also spark purple when weak. Activate the trap and make sure it dies while the trap is active to collect the essence into the canister.</p><p dir="ltr">Take this filled canister to the church and deposit into the machine before the timer runs out, <strong>but do not interact with the machine again</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the canister is deposited, the machine will prompt you to interact with it, but <strong>this will start the boss fight</strong>. Now, you'll want to gear up before the boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight prep</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're able to get all the steps done before round 25, you should be able to make do with level 2 armor and tier 2 Pack-a-Punched weapons. You'll want at least essential perks like Juggernog and Quick Revive. Craft a self-revive if possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Helpful equipment includes Decoy grenades and Monkey Bombs to distract zombies. Napalm ammo mod will help against the larger enemies. Don't bother with aerial killstreaks as you'll be indoors. Try using sentry guns or the Mutant Injection instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Shotguns and LGMs with a high ammo count might be helpful here.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Boss fight</h2><p dir="ltr">This takes place inside the church, so you don't have a lot of wiggle room. This fight is played out in three waves.</p><p dir="ltr">The first wave is just clearing out a ton of zombies, then you'll get an elite Mangler, and finally an elite Abomination. Survive and clear the waves.</p><p dir="ltr">Once the fight is over, there will be a prompt where all of your team gets knocked. So, don't panic. This gives you a final cutscene. The Liberty Falls main Easter egg is now complete.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Zombies, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-how-custom-loadouts-work-in-bo6-zombies/1100-6527402/">full guide on custom Zombies loadouts</a>.

                <p>After more than a year of silence, Bungie has given an update on the development progress of its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>. The lengthy video is surprisingly light on details, however, with only a hint of future playtests coming in 2025.</p><p>The update, delivered by game director Joe Ziegler, acts more like a reintroduction to Bungie's latest shooter as opposed to a meaningful update. Ziegler spends time explaining what an extraction shooter is, breaking down the high risk, high reward nature of the genre, while also giving brief hints as to how the games different classes might work. It aligns with a lot of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617"> what we already know about Bungie's shooter</a>, making it a gameplay update light on new details</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8WgMQuPwRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r8WgMQuPwRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video, Ziegler briefly speaks about two of the game's Runners--the name given to Marathon's playable characters--with each of their descriptions suggesting that Marathon is taking hints from existing hero shooters. The first is simply codenamed "Thief", with Ziegler assuming you'll have an idea of their gameplay style from the name alone. The other, codenamed "Stealth", is described as using deception to their advantage on the battlefield, with Ziegler remarking that he's enjoyed playing as the character in tests recently.</p><p>Ziegler stressed that Marathon is still not in a state where the team can show it off just yet, pointing at the various states at which distinct elements are at currently.</p><p>"Where the game is at right now, there's a variety of different things at different states inside of the game. Some things are a little more complete, like our environments are starting to come together in a really beautiful way. Some of the character models we've been iterating through; they're coming together but they're not fully there yet. Our enemy models are still kind of in an early state so we're still iterating through things to make those land in a strong way," said Ziegler.</p><p>"It's a little early to show you all of it in one piece," he continued. "But as you've noticed, as many of you are familiar with if you're familiar with game development, all of these things are on track. They're not all together, but when they all do come together we really, really are looking forward to showing you what that looks like and play.</p><p>Zielger ended off by inviting players interested in being invited to further tests to wishlist the game on Xbox Series X, PS5, and Steam, with store pages up for Marathon right now. This is the first time Bungie has spoken about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-revival-of-pre-halo-sci-fi-series-marathon/1100-6514533/" data-ref-id="1100-6514533"> Marathon since it's announcement in May 2023</a>, where it said that the next time, writing at the time, "now we’re going dark to focus on the game... and when we come back – we’ll have gameplay to show!". Marathon is still slated for release in 2025, although the Steam listing omits this and simply reads "Coming soon".</p>

It's the first mainline game in the series to feature a first-person camera perspective and introduces an all-new protagonist, Ethan Winters, whose storyline continues into Resident Evil 8. Even though it's almost a decade old, the game still looks fantastic thanks to the RE Engine powering its grotesque graphics, and remains one of the scariest games in the series.

                <p>Epic Games will be <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dramatically altering how progression works in Fortnite's various modes</a> in the near future. Starting with all new passes added after the current season ends, you will progress through any pass you have using XP--Festival points and Lego studs will be retired, and you'll be able to progress all of your current passes simultaneously by earning XP in any mode. This change will start with the new Festival pass--which is being re-dubbed as the "Music pass"-- that launches on Nov. 2, and the Lego Pass will be updated with this change on Dec. 1, when Fortnite Chapter 6 begins.</p><p>On top of the changes to progression, the passes themselves will be changing too. The current Festival and Lego passes, as well as the mini-pass events like this summer's Pirates of the Caribbean one, have all used the same 11-tier template that's split into free and paid tracks. New passes that start after Chapter 6 begins in December will finally abandon that template, switching to a new single track that will have both paid and free items. Likewise, the battle pass is being simplified, doing away with the battle star currency and swapping in a more straightforward progression system.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391549" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391549"></a><figcaption>Fortnite Festival will soon move on from this pass format.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4391549-fortnitefestivalseason5karolgpass.jpg"></figure><p>In essence, the battle passes, Lego passes, and Music passes will now all have a similar format, though the Lego and Music passes will likely still be much shorter than the battle passes.</p><p>On top of all that, starting in Chapter 6, Fortnite will no longer have an option for buying levels on its passes--instead, you'll be able to buy any specific item directly, though you'll still need to buy the pass itself first. In theory, this means you could be able to show up at the end of the season and purchase the tier 100 skin immediately without having to buy out the whole pass for $100+.</p><p>The passes will still go away at their stated end dates, and you won't be able to purchase or progress them after their respective season ends.</p><p>This could be considered a quality of life boost, since it will mean that you don't need to play Festival at all to complete the pass for that mode. But these changes will likely be accompanied by the removal or severe nerfing of passive XP from Festival and Lego Fortnite--because the quests for those modes will now award XP instead of a mode-specific currency, the passive XP becomes unnecessary. Since a lot of folks used these modes to level up while AFK, it's possible that this change is being made at least in part to eliminate that practice.</p><p>That passive rate of XP gain in these modes has been quite good, but overall progression may be slower once these changes kick in. We'll have to see how it actually works before we know if this is a positive change.</p>
