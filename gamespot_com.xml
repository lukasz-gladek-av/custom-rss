<section><p>Covering the early days of PS1 to the struggles of PS3, GameSpot spoke to Yoshida as he reflected on his legacy at PlayStation, from its very inception until now, nearly four decades later</p></section>
        
  
  

        
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">Ever since he was a boy, Shuhei Yoshida dreamed of living outside Japan. Born and raised in Kyoto, Yoshida studied science at his local university and spent his college downtime slaying beasts in Dragon Quest. He yearned to embark on a globe-trotting adventure of his own--and just like in his favorite RPG, destiny soon came calling.</p><p dir="ltr">Yoshida landed a job at Sony fresh out of college, excitedly joining the company's corporate strategy group. "With Walkman, TV and video, 80% to 90% of Sony's business was done outside Japan," Yoshida recalls, "So, I thought, at Sony, I might have a chance to live outside Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">Working under Sony's management group, Yoshida's job was to help grow internal businesses. There was one new team that caught Yoshida's eye: a small group, led by Ken Kutaragi, that had just finished developing the audio chip for Nintendo's massively successful SNES console. Although it was one of Yoshida's colleagues who was ultimately assigned to the project, Yoshida says he tried to assist with Kutaragi's project wherever he could. "Ken's team then started to work on a CD-ROM system for Super Nintendo," Yoshida said. "My colleague was not a big video game fan, so I was giving advice to him."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591449" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591449"></a><figcaption>Console modder Ben Heck got the Nintendo PlayStation prototype's CD drive running in 2017</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/43/434805/4591449-6202656489-32297.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Nintendo Betraystation</h2><p dir="ltr">As Yoshida excitedly gushed about video games to anyone who'd listen, Kutaragi's team worked diligently to provide Nintendo with the SNES CD-ROM expansion. Its working name? The Nintendo PlayStation. As Sony experimented with laptops and PCs, Yoshida kept his head down until 1991, when Sony's relationship with Nintendo suddenly went up in flames.</p><p dir="ltr">"At CES, Sony was preparing to announce the original Nintendo PlayStation," Yoshida explains. "But a couple of days before that, Nintendo announced a collaboration with Philips to release the CD-ROM attachment, instead."</p><p dir="ltr">After years of collaboration with Nintendo, it was a move that stunned everyone at Sony. "I think it was vaporware," reflects Yoshida of Nintendo's Phillips CD-ROM console, which ultimately never materialized. "I think [Nintendo] just made the announcement to get out of the contract with Sony." Whatever Nintendo's reasoning, Sony had been very publicly betrayed. "After that, Sony had two choices," Yoshida says. "Get out of the video game business or create their own console."</p><p dir="ltr">As we all know, Sony opted for the latter. Yet it wasn't enough just to release a rival console--for Sony's furious upper management, their machine had to wipe the floor with Nintendo's upcoming console. "Ken [Kutaragi] leveraged the anger of Sony management to get the investment that he needed to make a console with real-time 3D graphics," reveals Yoshida. "So it ended up being a much higher performance system than the original [Nintendo PlayStation], which was based on Super NES tech."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Hell hath no fury like a Sony scorned</h2><p dir="ltr">After partnering with Sony Music to help fund the company's ambitious game console, operation PlayStation was a go. In February 1993, Yoshida's years of excitable office video games chatter finally paid off and he was assigned to Kutaragi's PlayStation third-party licensing team. "Everyone else on my team were engineers," Yoshida says. "I felt incredibly lucky."</p><p dir="ltr">Under Sony Music Japan's tutelage, Yoshida's team approached their new console like a record label, going from door-to-door, vying to convince massive game publishers and indies alike to bring their games to Sony's new system. Yet Yoshida and Kutaragi didn't just have to overcome skepticism in Sony's gaming chops, but publishers' doubts around 3D gaming itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"A small number of companies were fascinated by the capability of PlayStation's real time 3D," Yoshida says of his initial meetings. "But at the time, most people were not familiar with 3D graphics." Luckily, that same year, Sega revealed Virtua Fighter for arcades, the first true 3D fighting game, and publishers finally began to see 3D's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">"As soon as that announcement happened, I got lots of phone calls from companies who were very interested to work with PlayStation," Yoshida recalls. "Sega Saturn was the biggest competition for PlayStation, but Sega really helped to educate the industry that 3D graphics can be used for more than racing or shooting games."</p><p dir="ltr">While Virtua Fighter eventually swayed the 3D skeptics, Yoshida says one publisher believed in PlayStation from the very beginning: Bandai Namco. Yoshida called the company Sony's "biggest ally for the launch of PlayStation." Part of this relationship stemmed from Namco having 3D arcade games ready to go while the current lineup of 16-bit consoles remained unable to run them. Ridge Racer and Tekken ultimately became crucial day-one graphical showcases for Sony's new console.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet it was winning over Nintendo's former third-party darling, Squaresoft (now known as Square Enix following a merger), that cemented PlayStation's Japanese success. "Square obviously had a huge hit with Final Fantasy games on Super Nintendo, " says Yoshida. "However, Sakaguchi-san, the creator, was very unhappy with the decision that Nintendo made with Nintendo 64 to use cartridges." Sakaguchi dreamed of shipping games with full 3D movies--epics that could truly immerse players in his fantastical world. "The cartridge has such a small memory that they didn't allow him to realize this vision," explains Yoshida. "So, he was very interested to work on a CD-ROM-based system."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Shmoozing Sake-guchi</h2><p dir="ltr">PlayStation, however, wasn't the only CD-ROM system in town. With Sega also trying to nab Square's newest game, Sony was desperate to sign Final Fantasy VII first. Luckily, Sony had a secret weapon up its sleeve. "My boss, who came from Sony Music Japan, was a really amazing schmoozer," smiles Yoshida. "He hung out with another vice president of Square who was running the business side. I was taken with them to have dinner or do karaoke so many times, and he schmoozed and somehow convinced them that Sony is easy to work with." The secret behind Final Fantasy VII coming to PlayStation? Sake and karaoke. "That's how business is done in Japan!" laughs Yoshida.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest, as they say, is history. PlayStation launched in Japan in December 1994 and was a huge hit, shifting 300,000 units in its first year in Japan before finding success in Europe and the US in 1995. Another factor that Yoshida attributes to PlayStation's success was Sony Music's insistence that game developers were given the spotlight. "In their mind, game creators are artists like musicians," explains Yoshida. "Some companies didn't allow the game developers to put their real name in the game's credits because they were afraid of other companies stealing these developers. But PlayStation said, 'Let's get the magazine to interview creators;, let's make them stars!'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591451" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591451"></a><figcaption>The PS3 launched on November 11, 2006 in Japan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591451-3419348054-XCRm8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With third parties flocking to the console in droves, Yoshida's job was complete. He was soon shifted over to head up first-party projects, where he helped produce games like Ape Escape and The Legend of Dragoon. Yet there was one PS1 classic that got away. "Another team I put together was not able to finish their game on PS1, which was Ico," says Yoshida of the Fumito Ueda classic. "We had an amazing-looking prototype. However, the game was not performing well on PS1. Ueda-san's ambition was too high and the game was running at 10fps, so I moved the project to PS2."</p><p dir="ltr">Then, in 2000, Yoshida finally realized his childhood dream and moved to the US to become the head of development for Sony's American studios. Sony, meanwhile, was also living out a dream of its own, as its once-unproven gaming upstart had now become the dominant console in the PS2 generation. While Yoshida laments a few missed exclusives--"Capcom decided to release Resident Evil 4 on GameCube, why?! We had Resident Evil 1, 2, and 3 on PlayStation..."--as the end of the PS2 generation rolled around, Sony seemed unstoppable.</p><p dir="ltr">And then, it all went wrong.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The PS3 generation, and a cell of Sony's own creation</h2><p dir="ltr">When the PS3 arrived in 2006, its prohibitively expensive price point ($499.99) and difficult-to-develop-for architecture turned the PS3 generation into a hubristic disaster. Suddenly, Sony was losing ground to another electronics company that had belatedly entered the console space, Microsoft.</p><p dir="ltr">"The PS3 generation was hard," recalls Yoshida. "For the first couple of years it was really tough to see the same games come out on PS3 and Xbox 360, and the Xbox 360 version performing better. In theory, PS3 was going to be much higher performance, but at launch we were not able to show that. We had first-party games like Resistance looking great, but then third-party games were constantly compared side-by-side unfavorably to 360. It was quite shocking."</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of the generation, the PS3 had toughed it out, eventually amassing an enviable lineup of exclusive titles. It's these mature, story-led games that would ultimately set the tone for Sony's enviable PS4 library. The quality of these games is one that Yoshida ultimately attributes to Sony executives' patience; although they weren't happy about it, Yoshida says his bosses allowed him to delay unfinished PS3 games no matter the cost.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every year I had to apologize to the business side that we have to delay this game," says Yoshida. "But the company understood that by spending enough time and polishing the game, in the end, the game will sell more than rushing it out."</p><p dir="ltr">One such game that Yoshida had to keep delaying? An ambitious zombie project from the creators of Uncharted. "It was a bit surprising that Naughty Dog wanted to move on from Uncharted, but also that they were going to create something really mature," he recalls. "Uncharted was like a summer blockbuster movie for a very broad audience, so I was a little concerned that we may be going too niche by going so mature. But in the end, their craft produced such an amazing game that they established an IP even bigger than Uncharted, [The Last of Us]. I'm so excited that they are working on a new IP again with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic</a>."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Unifying hardware and software</h2><p dir="ltr">The end of the PS3 generation saw a change of leadership from Ken Kutaragi to Kaz Hirai, and from then, Yoshida focused on helping developers collaborate with the hardware team during the production of the PS4--an effort to ensure that the disaster of the PS3 generation never happened again.</p><p dir="ltr">"Kaz asked me to move to Japan to work very closely with the hardware team," Yoshida recalls. "I was able to connect them to the right Worldwide Studio members and that's how PS4 and PS Vita, in my mind, became really good systems for developers to make games for."</p><p dir="ltr">In his final years at Sony, Yoshida moved away from top-level first-party decisions and went back to his PS1 roots. Try as he might, he became less interested in the AAA titles hogging the spotlight and was instead drawn to the quirky indie curiosities beckoning from the shadows.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was a huge proponent of indie games," smiles Yoshida. "Every time I went to a games show like E3 or Gamescom, even though we had booths to show our big, first-party titles, I went to the indie area. When I saw a game that I liked, I [took] a photo with the developers and [tried] to help promote these games. We were able to support games like Journey… And that led me to become the evangelist of indie games for PlayStation for the last five years of my career there."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591507" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4591507"></a><figcaption>Yoshida has always been a champion of indie games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4591507-7213130070-GVq9yeBX0AAyqax.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">A new chapter</h2><p dir="ltr">As of January 2025, Yoshida is a freelance consultant, working directly with indie developers. As well as being a notable indie champion, Yoshida is also a huge advocate for VR, working with long-standing VR developer NDreams on the recently launched game Reach. This is hardly a new passion for Yoshida, though, as he reveals that he was pivotal in bringing PSVR to the market. "I was involved in the hardware development of the first PSVR," says Yoshida. "The project started as a grassroots activity from Santa Monica Studio during [the] PS3 days."</p><p dir="ltr">Using the PS Move's 3D-tracking, Sony Santa Monica jerry-rigged a crude, handmade VR headset together in their spare time. Yoshida was instantly sold. "They customized a God of War game on PS3 and I tried it, and I was like, 'Wow, I'm in God of War!' I looked down and I was Kratos! It was an amazing experience."</p><p dir="ltr">As he excitedly tells me about his Xbox ROG Ally X preorder and laments the death of the Vita, it's impossible not to leave the conversation charmed by Shuhei Yoshida. There's a sense of playfulness about him--one that you can feel throughout the many of the initiatives he spearheaded at PlayStation, as well. From the quirky curation of games of the PS1 era to the childlike wonder of PSVR, after 39 years, Yoshida's playful spirit will undoubtedly be missed by PlayStation fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"The PS1 generation was like an indie scene," Yoshida smiles. "There were so many small teams making interesting new concepts that came out of nowhere. So many hit products that came from non-traditional game creators." Now as Yoshida leaves Sony behind and enters a new chapter of guiding independent creators, it seems he's ready to share that playfulness with the wider world.</p>

                <p>Final Fantasy Tactics has returned after 28 years to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review-a-polished-historical-gem/1900-6418413/">phenomenal critical acclaim</a> in The Ivalice Chronicles, with fans both old and new reveling in the improved gameplay and actor performances that weren’t possible in 1997. As Yasumi Matsuno, the creator of the original game, wrote in a moving <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a>, Tactics comes to players in a time much like when the original was released--a time fraught with “inequality and division” that may leave many feeling “robbed of hope.” While Tactics is a fantasy story set in a fictional setting, developers did take a page or two out of real historical events, such as England’s War of the Roses in the mid to late 1400s. It’s bittersweet that history repeats itself now, but it does emphasize how relevant the evergreen themes of Tactics are, and how important Rapha and Marach Galthena’s involvement in the story is.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Israel and Palestine were also making headlines in 1997, the recent dramatic escalation of the situation has become a prominent global conversation today. With this escalation comes an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/11/anti-muslim-hate-hits-new-high-in-us-advocacy-group" rel="nofollow ">uptick in anti-Arab sentiment</a>, making Rapha and Marach’s involvement in The Ivalice Chronicles that much more special to South West Asian and North African (SWANA) gamers like me. It’s also very refreshing to hear actors Elham Ehsas and Lara Sawalha bringing these characters to life so authentically because it’s no secret that SWANA coded characters have, historically, not been depicted in the most flattering or nuanced light--especially in video games. From Metal Slug to Counter Strike, SWANA coded characters have been one of three things: belly dancers, camel-riding snake charmers, or just flat out evil terrorists. Rapha and Marach tell a very different story--one that allows room for nuance and mirrors many of the issues that our community faces internationally, which was saying a lot back in 1997 and says even more in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Rapha and Marach are orphans who were swiftly brought under the wing of Duke Barrington, a powerful man who intended to use the siblings for their rare mantra abilities. Duke Barrington not only recruited Rapha and Marach as child soldiers for his war efforts, but he also indoctrinated and trained countless other children too, by opening orphanages filled with “a pool of willing young minds.” This allowed him to select the very best to "mold and train,” as Ramza puts it. It may sound cartoonishly evil, but this is actually eerily similar to how <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers" rel="nofollow ">the Taliban recruits today</a>. It is commendable that instead of framing Marach and Rapha as roadblocks designed to be cut down on Ramza’s journey, they are given a humanizing backstory that explains why they end up on a megalomaniac’s side of the war instead of Ramza’s. Rapha especially plays a crucial role in highlighting just how misled she and her brother have been, and tries her best to make him see that, in spite of his initial obstinance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506"></a><figcaption>Rapha confronts Marach about his belief in Duke Barrington.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, despite how much care is taken in handling the Galthenas’ story, there is room for critique as well. It's worth noting that the siblings are the only characters in the game with mantra abilities; this feeds into an Orientalist trope, essentially exoticizing the only SWANA coded characters in the game. Additionally, the fact that Rapha and Marach are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nz6zt1/rapha_and_marach_are_terrible_characters_with/" rel="nofollow ">not well-optimized</a> at all makes them much less popular with Tactics fans. While this is relatively easy to fix with some respeccing, it still isn’t immediately obvious how to best utilize both characters in combat, and that could ultimately dissuade players from including Rapha and Marach in their parties, which is unfortunate and reflects some carelessness on the part of Square.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major critique I have is one narrative moment that paints an unflattering picture of Marach, specifically. When Rapha and Marach are first introduced in The Ivalice Chronicles, they are mid-argument. Marach is angry with Rapha for saying disparaging things about the man who he thinks saved them as children. When Rapha tells him she knows Barrington is the one who made them orphans in the first place, Marach slaps her across the face and says he “will not abide [her] ill-mannered tongue”. This seems to suggest that Marach is a fervent supporter of Duke Barrington and is enraged that anyone, let alone his own sister, would say a negative word about him. What this moment also does, is play into a negative stereotype about SWANA men being <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10857900/#:~:text=Arab%20Stereotypes&amp;text=Similar%20to%20Black%20people%2C%20Arab,i.e.%2C%20a%20physical%20threat%29." rel="nofollow ">‘inherently more violent’</a>, especially toward women. This scene makes even less sense when it is revealed that Marach actually wants to be free of Barrington, and is not intent on staying in service to him.</p><p dir="ltr">With all the changes and improvements that this version of Tactics went through, including a gorgeous script overhaul, I think there was room to remove the slap from Marach and Rapha’s argument to avoid unintentionally reinforcing a negative stereotype. It wouldn’t be the first time a character was re-examined in the Final Fantasy franchise. Cid in Final Fantasy 7 was originally implied to be <a href="https://youtu.be/KYWGfBjo0Ew?si=Fz8iAtOwEf9nkLbw" rel="nofollow ">abusive</a> in the 1997 version of the game, and has since been reworked to be an endearing, upbeat southern gentleman in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><p dir="ltr">While the original FF7 Cid was a pretty dour character overall, Marach, on the other hand, is a flawed character, but not a bad one. He genuinely cares for his sister, and even takes a bullet for her once he finally hears Duke Barrington admit to being the villain he has always been. After Rapha brings Marach back to life with the Scorpio Stone, the siblings both join Ramza’s party. For the first time in their lives, they actively choose what to fight for and who to fight alongside. It’s also revealed in optional dialogue when battling Hashmal/Folmarv that Rapha and Marach want that encounter to be the very last time they have to kill anyone ever again, which was unheard of for SWANA coded characters in the 90s and is still fairly uncommon now.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Rapha and Marach’s story is a bit of a short one in Tactics’ overall narrative, it is still impactful and continues to go against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people, like many other characters get to be. Would it be nice if their stats were better optimized? Sure. But in the grand scheme of things, the Galthena siblings are still great examples of how SWANA coded characters can be, and what I hope to see more of in future games.</p>

                <p>It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">blockbuster success</a>. Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> somehow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/" data-ref-id="1100-6535685">briefly outgunned Battlefield 6</a>. Now, another indie game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7mXFwVNX6Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3949040/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as "early access."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CaS-_47zI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P2CaS-_47zI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.</p><p>There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-631981">Among the Wild</a>, but it just isn't ready for release yet.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Many wondered if Halo Studios employed some kind of artificial intelligence tool to help with this, but Microsoft has not confirmed one way or another, stating only that there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">no mandate that the studio <em>needed </em>to use AI</a>. In any event, executive producer Damon Conn said, "We've done everything we can to make sure that we preserve the heart of Halo as we rebuild and retouch everything."</p><p>The developers working on the remake said they were able to achieve this while keeping the "tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact" of the original game "preserved" for Campaign Evolved.</p><p>The remake makes some controversial changes, too, including the addition of sprint and some vehicle updates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">one of the game's original designers is not too happy about.</a> Another developer who worked on the original Halo weighed in on the remake with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">different, more enthusiastic and hopeful take. </a></p><p>Campaign Evolved launches in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, as well as PlayStation 5. The franchise is synonymous with Xbox and has never appeared on PlayStation until this remake. It may not be the last Halo game on PS5, either, as Halo Studios has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">"Halo is on PlayStation" going forward.</a></p><p>There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-halo-1-remake-has-no-multiplayer/1100-6535707/" data-ref-id="1100-6535707">no head-to-head multiplayer support</a>, but campaign co-op will be available. Check out the video above to get a closer look at the remake compared against the original. Pricing for Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been announced, but it has been confirmed that the game will launch at the same time on all platforms, as opposed to coming to Xbox and PC before PS5.</p><p>Microsoft has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, and another one might be a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/"> live-service Halo game</a> that could also release in 2026 for Halo's 25th anniversary.</p>
