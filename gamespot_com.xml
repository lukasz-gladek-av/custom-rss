                <p>Following the tragic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-horizon-and-john-wick-star-lance-reddick-dies-at-60/1100-6512458/">death of actor Lance Reddick in 2023</a>, Horizon fans were curious about what the fate of his character Sylens would be. With the release of Lego Horizon Adventures this week, it has been confirmed--in that spin-off game at least--that Sylens does appear and is voiced by Star Trek Voyager actor Tim Russ.</p><p>A deuteragonist in the games, Sylens is similar to Horizon's hero Aloy in several ways, as he also explores the secret history of the world following a cataclysmic event that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Russ is no stranger to the Horizon series, as he'd previously played the character Jetakka in Horizon Forbidden West. In Lego Horizon Adventures, he appears as "DJ Sylens" (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-late-lance-reddick-with-star-trek-actor-tim-russ" data-target="true"

ready to share details at the time. Several of the original Horizon voice actors are also in the Lego game, including Ashly Burch as Aloy, JB Blanc as Rost, and John Macmillan as Varl. In addition to Sylens, Reddick also voiced Zavala in Bungie's Destiny games.</p><p>Following his passing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-players-paying-tribute-to-lance-reddicks-commander-zavala-in-game/1100-6512463/">Destiny 2 players held an in-game vigil for the actor</a>, and Bungie later announced that his role would be inherited by Keith David starting in The Final Shape expansion.</p><p>"Via bricks and minifigs, Horizon is charmingly remade for a younger audience, though its formulaic missions may strain players of all ages," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-for-buildin-jest/1900-6418316/">Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. The game officially launches for PS5, PC, and Switch on November 14.</p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has commented on bringing more Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, saying he's not ruling anything out, and that includes the next Halo release.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said, "I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say, 'Thou must not,'" he said. For the next Halo game specifically, Bloomberg reported that Spencer said it was too early to make a decision about that.</p><p>In September, Microsoft announced that it was working on multiple new Halo games that are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been officially announced, however. That being said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">elements from the Project Foundry demo are likely to show up in future Halo titles</a>, Microsoft has said.</p><p>Halo games being made on Unreal Engine 5 could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">make it easier for the franchise to come to PS5</a>, tech experts claim. Halo on PS5 wouldn't be a total surprise, as it was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">Microsoft was considering bringing the sci-fi series to Sony's home console</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, Microsoft has released a few of its games on rival platforms, including Sea of Thieves and Grounded. One of the next big ones is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches in December on Xbox and PC before coming to PS5 in early 2025.</p><p>Also in the Bloomberg interview, Spencer said he expects Microsoft will eventually release a handheld gaming device; the company is now making prototypes, the report said. "I love us building devices," Spencer said. "And I think our team could do some real innovative work, but we want to be informed by learning and what's happening now."</p><p>Microsoft has been openly discussing plans for a handheld gaming device for a long time already, and the latest rumor was that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next Xbox home console could also link up with a new Xbox handheld device.</a></p><p>Spencer also discussed the possibility of more acquisitions, following Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard. He said it might be worth pursuing deals that add "geographic diversity" to the company, including in Asia. There are no "imminent" deals coming, however.</p><p>Microsoft already owned a prominent Japanese game developer, Tango Gameworks, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut the studio down</a>--it later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">re-emerged under the ownership of PUBG company Krafton.</a></p><p>In the past year, Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">overseen more than 2,500 layoffs at Xbox</a>, and he said in the Bloomberg interview that "the Xbox business has never been more healthy." Spencer had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">always said the layoffs were necessary because capitalism demanded it. </a></p><p>He ended his chat with Bloomberg by seemingly reacting to Sony's recent launch of the $700 PS5 Pro (which costs more than $1,000 in some regions like Australia), saying expensive consoles are not going to help grow the video game industry.</p><p>"I feel pretty good about where this industry is going," he said. "To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles."</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up has revealed more details on the game's upcoming PC release, and it has high expectations for the platform. In the studio's Q3 2024 earnings report, Shift Up confirmed that Stellar Blade is "being considered within 2025" for a PC release--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-considering-a-pc-port-and-sequel/1100-6523587/">something it has spoken about in the past</a>.</p><p>"Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles," <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up said in its report</a>. To put that into context, Black Myth: Wukong had a strong launch in August with <a

figure that can potentially be reached with its upcoming expansion. In comparison, Stellar Blade reached 1 million sales on PS5 by the end of June.</p><p>Shift Up also mentioned that sales on PS5--where Stellar Blade is exclusively available for now--continue to remain stable, thanks in part to the studio constantly updating the game and releasing new DLC for it. "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion," Shift Up explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/">The Nier: Automata DLC for Stellar Blade</a> will be available starting November 20, and in addition to some stylish outfits inspired by the game's co-protagonist 2B, there'll be a new hairstyle for heroine Eve to equip, as well as a photo mode will be added to the game.</p><p>"A strong battle system and exciting moments make Stellar Blade more than just an imitator," Imran Khan wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stellar-blade-review-nier-as-it-can-get/1900-6418215/">Stellar Blade review</a>.</p>

                <p>Nearly three decades ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-red-review/1900-2684314/" data-ref-id="1900-2684314">Pokemon</a> debuted in Japan and spawned a best-selling video game franchise that continues to this day. The Pokemania phenomenon has since grown to include multiple anime series, films, trading-card games, toys, and more. Pokemon was also one of the 12 finalists to make it into this year's inductees for the Toy Hall of Fame. However, Pikachu and his pals are going to have to wait until at least 2025 after being denied this year.</p><p>The National Toy Hall of Fame has <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its new inductions for 2024</a>, and Pokemon didn't make the cut. But at least Pokemon is in good company. The Choose Your Own Adventure books, remote-controlled vehicles, Hess Toy Trucks, trampoline, Apples to Apples, and Sequence were also denied the honor.</p><p>Hasbro was the big winner, as two of its 1980s franchises, Transformers and My Little Pony, earned their induction into this year's class at the Toy Hall of Fame. The Transformers toys debuted in 1984, and the franchise has largely endured for four decades. My Little Pony was originally launched as My Pretty Pony in 1981 before it became a hit toy line of its own. MLP went dormant for a few years before a 2003 revival proved to successful. The card game Phase 10 was the final 2024 inductee for the Toy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Pokemon may not have won this year, but its ongoing popularity is staggering. On the Nintendo Switch alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">the Pokemon franchise has sold 99 million units</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios--which was co-founded by Battlefield veteran Patrick Soderlund--reversed course on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-delay-has-completely-changed-its-genre/1100-6514238/" data-ref-id="1100-6514238">Arc Raiders</a>. What was originally envisioned as a free-to-play shooter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/" data-ref-id="1100-6525993">shifted over to a premium release</a>. Now, the latest gameplay video for Arc Raiders demonstrates why Embark Studios felt confident about making that move as it shows off an impressive--and dangerous--post-apocalyptic world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game takes place in a future where humanity has retreated beneath the surface of the Earth to escape the lethal Arc machines, which are programed to slaughter any humans they find. Players assume the role of one of the Raiders, who risk their lives by returning to the surface to find badly needed supplies while evading both the machines as well as rival Raiders who aren't looking to share any of the spoils.</p><p>Getting in and out of the locations isn't easy, even though having a team to watch your back helps increase the odds of survival. The smaller Arc machines are always on patrol, and the larger machines aren't as easy to dispatch as their counterparts. Enemy Raiders can also ambush a team before they reach their extraction point. But that's only going to draw the attention of the Arc machines, which will target both sides of the conflict. As far as the machines are concerned, the only good human is a dead one.</p><p>Although Arc Raiders isn't finished yet, this early gameplay is already looking good. Embark Studios will release the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025.</p>

                <p>Move over, College Football 25: it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s turn to partner with college athletes in a crossover we never saw coming. Blizzard has announced a new partnership with the University of Washington in which the college will become the University of Warcraft for a week in the lead up to the Washington Huskies' home finale against UCLA.</p><p>UW Football is collaborating with WoW to promise a "one-of-a-kind in-stadium experience" on Friday, with World of Warcraft mascots leading the team onto the field, a fan zone offering character meet-and-greets, and unique visuals for the stadium video board. Blizzard has also revealed a unique logo for its University of Warcraft collaboration, and has promised more unique WoW-themed graphics leading up to the game.</p><p>Blizzard is also getting some of the Washington Huskies team on board for the takeover, signing NIL (name, image, likeness) deals with players Carson Bruener, Denzel Boston, Jonah Coleman, Camden Simon, Adam Mohammad, Kamren Fabiculanan, Jacob Lane, Cameron Broussard, D’Angalo Titialli, Demond Williams Jr., and Will Rodgers. The players will be posting about the collab on social media to promote the Warcraft takeover--though its not clear if they'll be making an appearance in the game itself.</p><p>"We are thrilled to unite interactive entertainment with the sports industry to celebrate 20 incredible years of World of Warcraft delighting millions of players worldwide," said Blizzard head of marketing Monica Austin, as quoted by <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/name-image-likeness/nil-news/world-of-warcraft-makes-nil-debut-with-washington-huskies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>. "Our teams have been working together to create incredible in-person and broadcast experiences for fans, and we hope Husky Nation and World of Warcraft players alike are excited to WoW down to Washington."</p><p>The Warcraft-themed game is taking place this Friday November 15 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET at Husky Stadium in Seattle, and will be broadcast on Fox for anyone curious to see how this unexpected collaboration plays out.</p>
