                <p dir="ltr">Sometimes, malicious actors infiltrate the security systems of the biggest gaming companies on the planet, take information from those servers, and spread it throughout the Internet. Other times, a company pushes the wrong button, and a piece of news gets revealed before the company planned to do so. Today, Riot Games made the latter oopsie, and we now know the ninth playable character in 2XKO is Blitzcrank, the hulking automaton from Zaun.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Riot Games website officially updated imagery for 2XKO across multiple pages, including the 2XKO Support page. However, instead of using character art for one of the eight fighters already revealed, Blitzcrank suddenly appeared, and his addition to the roster was unintentionally confirmed.</p><p><span>This is the first new piece of news we've heard on the League of Legends fighting game since Evo earlier this month, where Riot confirmed that a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2xko-riots-league-of-legends-tag-fighter-enters-closed-beta-this-fall/1100-6533325/">closed beta test</a><span> will begin September 9 for PC players, with a console beta coming "at a later date." Along with confirmation of the character joining the roster, Riot also confirmed that Blitzcrank will be part of the closed beta on day one.</span></p><p dir="ltr">First announced in 2021 as Project L, 2XKO is a 2v2 tag-based fighting game featuring champions from League of Legends, Riot's flagship MOBA title. Among the other confirmed champions for the 2XKO roster include Arcane co-stars Jinx, Ekko, and Vi, as well as the samurai Yasuo and the axe-wielding knight Darius.</p><p dir="ltr">2XKO will launch as a free-to-play fighter on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, though an official release date has not yet been confirmed. More information on Blitzcrank will be released on September 2.</p>

                <p>In an unexpected statement today, Activision made a dramatic announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">no longer allow</a> players to transfer any Black Ops 6 characters, weapons, or skins to Black Ops 7. Many are taking this as a sign that Activision doesn't want Black Ops 7 to be overrun with the wacky skins that Call of Duty has become known for against a backdrop where competitor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> will only include "grounded" cosmetics.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Activision said it is aware of the "conversation" happening online about "the identity of Call of Duty" and the perception from some that it's "drifted" away from its identity.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty Black Ops 7: First Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>"Some of you have said we've drifted from what made Call of Duty unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you," the company said.</p><p>Activision added that Black Ops 7 developers Treyarch and Raven have been guided by the goal of making a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 while at the same time "taking some big swings."</p><p>The company had previously said Black Ops 7 would included the franchise's Carry Forward feature that allows content from the past game to move forward to the next one. However, Black Ops 7 is doing away with this, and now, operators, skins, and weapons from Black Ops 6 will not carry forward to Black Ops 7.</p><p>"Black Ops 7 needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting. That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the developer said. This only applies to Black Ops 7, as previous content will continue to carry forward to Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement not long after Battlefield 6's big reveal, during which developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>The Call of Duty in-game store no doubt is a big-time money-maker, fueled in part by the kind of outlandish skins previous games have offered. It remains to be seen what kind of extra cosmetic content Activision will up-sell in Black Ops 7, or if the statement today will have any bearing on that.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta</a> begins in October. </p>
