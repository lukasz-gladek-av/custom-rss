          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders - October 17th Server Slam Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-free-test-for-everyone-this-weekend-on-all-platforms/1100-6535422/" data-ref-id="1100-6535422">announced previously</a>, the Arc Raiders free test allows people to try the Dam Battleground map and experience the progression, crafting, and quest systems. For Embark Studios, the test is being undertaken to help the studio prepare its servers for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Everyone who takes part in the test will get the Server Slammer backpack cosmetic reward when the full game launches on October 30. Progress from the test does not carry forward to the full launch.</p><p>Embark Studios was founded by a team of industry veterans, including former longtime EA and Battlefield executive Patrick Soderlund. Arc Raiders, a $40 game, is coming to market just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">EA's Battlefield 6 launched on October 10 and had a huge debut.</a></p><p>Arc Raiders is set in the future and has players going underground to take shelter from "Arc" robots. Players venture out into the land above ground to collect resources and fight. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Arc Raiders.</p><p>Following Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders, the shooter space gets another jolt in November when Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches.</a></p>

                <p>Next year marks the 25th anniversary of Halo, and it's been apparent for some time that there's a game on the horizon. As recently as last month, Halo Studios reminded fans that it's going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/news-on-halos-future-is-coming-very-soon/1100-6535104/" data-ref-id="1100-6535104">unveil some big news</a> at the Halo World Championships. Now we know exactly when that announcement is going to come.</p><p>The Halo World Championships run from October 24-26 in Seattle, Washington. The schedule has been released, and Halo Studios will be sharing its news at 1 PM PT / 4 PM ET on Friday, October 24. Halo Studios community director Brian Jarrard has also hyped it up as an update "on one of Halo Studios' projects."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ske7ch/status/1978966931014041629?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Can't wait for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloWC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HaloWC</a> next week!

The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered developer Virtuos is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-combat-evolved-remake-coming-from-oblivion-remastered-dev-report/1100-6535196/" data-ref-id="1100-6535196">reportedly working on that project</a> with Halo Studios. While that game was previously remastered in 2011 as Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, the new version is rumored to be using a hybrid engine that combines Unreal Engine 5 and the Halo Reach Engine. It may even be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">the first version of Halo to hit PlayStation consoles</a>.</p><p>Steve Downes, the voice of Master Chief, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-voice-actor-says-big-news-is-coming-soon/1100-6535449/" data-ref-id="1100-6535449">has also dropped a few hints</a> about the upcoming announcement, without saying anything definitively.

                <p>Glen Schofield, a video game industry veteran known for co-creating the Dead Space series and working on multiple Call of Duty games, has said the gaming industry is facing major challenges and that developers can look to artificial intelligence technologies to help solve some of the issues. Schofield made these comments at the same time that many in the video game industry have raised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">concerns, objections, and fears about the further adoption and implementation of AI.</a></p><p>"We need to fix the gaming industry right now," Schofield said at Gamescom Asia recently, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was. Instead of all this negativity."</p><p>The games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">should embrace AI, not fear it</a>, Schofield said.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us," he said. "It's here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It's not just for directors and artists; it's for writers and marketing execs."</p><p>Schofield called upon games industry executives, owners, and founders to start training developers on AI and begin to use the tools "as soon as you can." This is already happening, as a survey from 2024 found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide already use AI in their development pipelines</a>, despite misgivings from workers about it.</p><p>A concern about AI voiced by many is that it could replace people and human creativity, but Schofield said humans will always be vital to the process. "Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry," he said to developers in the room. "And those ideas? They come from you."</p><p>Previously, Schofield said the adoption of AI in the games business <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">might cause some "disruption" in the job market in the short term</a>, but more jobs will be created overall on a long-enough timeline.

                <p dir="ltr">The former creative lead of the Assassin's Creed series wants to clarify that it wasn't his choice to step away from the franchise. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">Marc-Alexis Côté left Ubisoft</a> after roughly 20 years with the company--including the last three as vice president and executive producer of Assassin's Creed.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7384672277055012864/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn</a>, Côté stated that he's still passionate about Assassin's Creed, and he didn't "make that choice" to leave the series. "I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside," said Côté, who prefaced this by saying he's not resentful toward Ubisoft.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Ubisoft announced that a new subsidiary named<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/"> Vantage Studios will oversee the Assassin's Creed franchise</a>, along with Rainbow Six and Far Cry. With this reorganization, Côté noted that Ubisoft "decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise." As previously reported, a "different position was mentioned" to Côté, but he said "it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity" of what he was doing over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">Côté helped launch the latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, earlier this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While still unofficial, mounting evidence and leaks point to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/">Assassin's Creed Shadows heading to Switch 2 in December</a>. It was also reported earlier this month that Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canceled an Assassin's Creed game that was set during the American Civil War</a> because the company was worried it was too controversial.</p>

                <p>After less than two days, Battlefield Studios has announced that it's reverting the recent Battlefield 6 ticket changes based on feedback. For anyone just catching up, the developer said on Wednesday that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-matches-are-speeding-up/1100-6535444/" data-ref-id="1100-6535444"> ticket numbers for Conquest maps would drop from 1000 to lower values</a>, but less than 48 hours later, the developer <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/1979118925699747944?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> the ticket numbers are reverting back to 1000 for all maps.</p><p>All Conquest matches now begin with 1,000 tickets for each side and a 45-minute time limit. The developer previously dropped the starting ticket numbers down to 700-900 depending on the map, a decision the company made to help speed up matches. But that's all changing now, and Battlefield Studios said people may face longer matches on larger maps like Mirak Valley and Firestorm.</p><p>"We'll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right," the developer said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586666" data-ratio="0.56003430531732" data-width="1166" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4586666"></a><figcaption>More Battlefield 6 changes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4586666-screenshot2025-10-17at9.06.50%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>This was one of a few major changes that Battlefield Studios announced recently, as the developer also said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-xp-farms-will-be-patched-out-soon-but-player-progression-will-be-dramatically-improved/1100-6535517/" data-ref-id="1100-6535517">patch out XP farm exploits and improve player progression.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 </a>launches on October 28, which is also the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>In other news, Battlefield 6 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">more than 7 million copies out of the gate</a>, making it the "biggest opening" ever for the esteemed FPS series.
