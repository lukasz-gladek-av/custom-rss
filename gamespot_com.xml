                <p>Surprise! CD Projekt Red still has more updates planned for Cyberpunk 2077, months after the Polish studio said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no longer had anyone working on the game</a>. The studio has confirmed Cyberpunk 2077 Update 2.2, which will introduce "new features" to the role-playing game.</p><p>CD Projekt Red isn't ready to disclose what these features are but said it will host a video broadcast on December 10 where it will "dive deep" on what's coming to the game. The broadcast takes place at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET / 5 PM CET on December 10, and it will be streamed live on Twitch and YouTube.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 REDstreams alert 📢<br>Join us for a new episode of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/REDstreams?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#REDstreams</a>, where we'll dive deep into the new features Coming Soon TM for Cyberpunk 2077 in Update 2.2!<br>See you tomorrow at 5 PM CET on our Twitch and, for the first time ever, simultaneously on our YouTube channel.… <a href="https://t.co/gxABDNpQN2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gxABDNpQN2</a></p>  — Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1866150925678657589?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At the end of May 2024, CD Projekt Red confirmed that, for the first time in 10 years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077/1100-6523775/" data-ref-id="1100-6523775">no one at the studio was working on Cyberpunk 2077.</a> Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion came out in September 2023, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-big-cyberpunk-2077-update-launches-december-5/1100-6519672/" data-ref-id="1100-6519672">final major update landing in December 2023. </a></p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 originally launched in December 2020.

                <p>Considering that it's taken over a decade for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> to reach players, expectations are sky high for Rockstar Games' next GTA installment. That anticipation and the hype behind it are being parodied on PlayStation Store with a page for Grand Taking Ages 6, a game that may or may not actually exist.</p><p>The listing for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013590" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grand Taking Ages 6</a> appears to have gone online around December 7, and it features what appears to be AI-generated art in the vein of GTA 6 along with a synopsis that suggests it will put players in charge of their own game studio simulation. According to the description, it allows fans to "run your dream game studio while juggling angry fans, corporate chaos, and endless delays. Fight your way through gaming conventions, dodge ruthless journalists, and master the art of creative excuses." It also claims the game will be released in May 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4412228"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4412228-grandtakingages6.jpg"></figure><p>The page includes fake review quotes from GameSpot, IGN, and PC Gamer "from [a] parallel universe where the game is already out." It also features a dedication to the players who didn't live long enough to see Grand Taking Ages 6's release, before adding that "PS6 doesn't exist yet, but by the time some games release, it probably will."</p><p>While a game developer tycoon game like this could be an intriguing indie title, this parody doesn't seem to have a real game behind it. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-parody-grand-taking-ages-vi-pops-up-on-the-playstation-store-once-again-reminding-us-that-curation-basically-doesnt-exist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> notes that the developer listed, Violarte sp. z o. O., only recently launched an official site with "fake games and awards as well as what look like fake employees visualized either with stock photos or generative AI." In other words, this appears to be a joke, but it does call into question how it was able to pass review before it was listed on PSN. </p><p>The first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">recently had its one-year anniversary</a> without a follow-up trailer. A developer from Rockstar also promised "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-teases-mind-blowing-things/1100-6527967/" data-ref-id="1100-6527967">absolutely mind-blowing things</a>" in the sequel while accepting GTA 6's Most Anticipated Game award at the Golden Joysticks. Nearly a month ago, Rockstar confirmed that Grand Theft Auto 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">remains on track for a Fall 2025 release</a> onPlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Lego Fortnite</a> is expanding in a big way this week. Not only are we getting a new Lego Pass with piles of new content for the existing Lego Fortnite survival/crafting game, but we're getting an entirely new Lego game, dubbed Brick Life.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Brick Life, which launches on December 12, is an open-world social sim in which you and 31 of your closest friends can hang out in Brick Bay, a lively Lego City that's full of activities, jobs, and empty lots you can build on, and Brick Bay will be expanding all the time. For example, December 18 will mark the opening of the Rooftop Club, a fancy social space that provides stunning views of the city from above. The launch of Brick Life happens to coincide with the addition of text chat to every Fortnite experience, which will be key for a social sim like this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411527"></a><figcaption>Brick Life is designed as a family-friendly social sandbox mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4411527-1%286%29.png"></figure><p>Brick Life isn't just some new Creative Lego island, however--Epic is treating Brick Life as a full new game on the same level as the existing Lego Fortnite survival game. As a result, that original Lego Fortnite game is being rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey, with the term "Lego Fortnite" now referring to everything under that umbrella, rather than a specific mode.</p><p>Lego Fortnite Odyssey, meanwhile, is getting its own massive update this week that introduces a new villain, the Storm King, and a new faction that opposes him called the Storm Chasers. This new quest line will cause destructive storms to pop up all over the map at random--you'll need to navigate treacherous Storm Dungeons to make them go away and make progress toward defeating the Storm King.</p><p>All this new content for Lego Fortnite is being accompanied by an all-new Lego Pass, which is headlined by the new Raven Team Syd skin, which unlocks as soon as you buy the pass. Remember that access to the Lego Pass, along with the Music Pass and OG Pass, are now included with Fortnite Crew, so if you subscribe to Crew at any time while this Lego Pass is active, you'll immediately receive the Raven Team Syd skin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png" data-ref-id="1300-4411523"></a><figcaption>The original Lego Fortnite survival game has been rebranded as Lego Fortnite Odyssey.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4411523-legofortniteodyssey_stormchasers_keyart.png"></figure><p>On top of that, Lego Fortnite has some completely free skins it wants to give you. Connecting your Lego and Epic accounts will grant you the Mr. Dappermint skin--he's that giant candy cane that they sell in the shop each December--as well as the Explorer Emilie skin that has been available for doing that since last year. And just for good measure, playing Fortnite on mobile and earning any amount of XP before February 21 will grant you the Chord Kahele skin, which will be the first Festival default skin that will be equippable as a skin, and which also has a Lego style.</p><p>Brick Life is just one of Fortnite's big new modes in Chapter 6, along with the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-1-weapons-map-and-changes/2900-6012/" data-ref-id="2900-6012">OG mode</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-finally-getting-official-first-person-mode-but-its-not-battle-royale/1100-6528295/" data-ref-id="1100-6528295">first-person Ballistic mode</a>. Fortnite's got plenty of stuff to keep us occupied through the holidays, it seems.</p>

                <p>Hold on to your potatoes, because developer MachineGames has released the first patch for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The update adds path tracing for select Nvidia cards, improved whip behavior, and a host of gameplay fixes, as detailed in the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/ZKn6jyPTe2ElFSJ0yZ2WA/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-1?linkId=100000316950846" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda's website</a>, MachineGames provided a laundry list of improvements for the action-adventure game, headlined by path tracing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-run-on-your-pc-check-out-the-requirements/1100-6528208/" data-ref-id="1100-6528208">for PC players</a>. Think of this feature--which is also in the works for AMD cards, according to the developer--as <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a souped-up version of ray tracing</a>. That means, for example, offering even more realistic lighting sources and reflections. However, you need the hardware to support it, as the developer says at least 12GB VRAM is needed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="580730137" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"
