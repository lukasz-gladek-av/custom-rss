          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Late last year, Microsoft signaled its plans to make Edge the preferred browser for PC gamers with the first look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-edge-to-be-your-gaming-browser-with-edge-game-assist/1100-6528001/" data-ref-id="1100-6528001">Microsoft Edge Game Assist</a>. It's a version of Edge that was specifically made for gaming, with browsers and windows that appear on top of games so players can access strategy guides and tips as needed. Now, Microsoft Edge Game Assist is out of the initial testing phase and available for all to use.</p><p>Game Assist appears to have been modeled on Steam's overlay browser. It can also detect when a handful of supported games are being played and offer relevant info on a side panel. The games that are currently supported include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. However, those aren't the only titles that can be played. Any game can be used in this mode, but only the supported games will have automatic guides readily available. The video below demonstrates how the Game Assist is supposed to work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZadyqM7Gxs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NZadyqM7Gxs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can access this feature by going to Microsoft Edge and opening up the Settings and more to find the Game Assist widget. Once installed, the Game Assist feature will be available in the Game Bar. Because the Game Assist shares date with Edge's browser data, players' favorites, browsing history, and cookies will all remain the same. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Game Assist is still technically in a preview state and support for more titles will be added in the future. It's another facet of Microsoft's ongoing gaming ambitions, which include plans to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-app-just-added-400-pc-games-and-microsoft-wants-more/1100-6528393/" data-ref-id="1100-6528393">all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app</a>. Late last year, Microsoft also launched a test pilot program for Game Pass Ultimate members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

Over 180 different Hello Kitty-themed furniture and decor will be added, such as the Badtz-Maru chair and the Tuxedo Sam table.</p><p>The DLC also comes with changing seasons to freshen up the landscape as well as festive events. These events include the Eggciting Cherry Blossom Festival, Frosty Funday, Halloween Spooktacular, and the Fireworks Festival.
