                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom promised players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-will-receive-major-free-updates-every-three-or-four-months/1100-6532588/" data-ref-id="1100-6532588">that major updates to the game will be released every three or four months</a>. Now, Funcom has shared a broader roadmap of its plans for Dune: Awakening, including both free and paid DLC.</p><p>Funcom posted the Dune: Awakening DLC roadmap <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>, and the dev team noted it has been working to fix bugs and exploits while banning cheaters and improving the stability of the game. At GamesCom later this week, Funcom will debut new details about September's free update for Chapter 2 and the paid DLC, The Lost Harvest. These updates won't modify the endgame content of Awakening, because they were in development before the game launched.</p><p>The free updates for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 will arrive between January and March 2026 and April and June 2026, respectively. Details about Chapter 4 are scarce, but Chapter 3 will feature a revamped endgame. In the meantime, Funcom is implementing some requested endgame changes, including improved player logging and deep desert loot, as well as a way to locate or salvage lost vehicles. Another new service will update players on the status of their bases via email.</p><p>Awakening's 2026 paid DLCs, Raiders of the Broken Lands and The Water Wars, will arrive in the first and second quarters of the year, respectively. The roadmap's info on the former notes that "The broken lands are shattered plains of broken rock, known for their fearsome raiders." The Water Wars will revolve around a conflict between the Water Shipper families over control of the polar caps of Arrakis.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Funcom refunded some players after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-after-accidentally-turning-a-pve-zone-into-pvp/1100-6533059/" data-ref-id="1100-6533059">a PvE zone was mistakenly transformed into a PvP area</a>. The developer also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">Dune: Awakening will come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> in 2026.</p>

                <p>A Fortnite Creative map caused a stir over the weekend by being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s most popular individual mode for a short period of time. Steal the Brainrot, a user-made competitive tycoon map that was ripped off from a massively popular Roblox game, managed to pull in just over 183,000 concurrent players on Sunday, making it the top mode in Epic's metaverse for a couple hours, and sparking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a conversation</a> among players about what's going on.</p><p>Those are impressive numbers for a Creative island, though it's not <em>truly</em> accurate that it ever was the top Fortnite mode--the reality is that it peaked at number 3. At the time that Steal the Brainrot hit its top mark of 183k concurrent players, Fortnite's main Battle Royale mode had more than 300,000 people playing, split between build, Zero Build, and ranked. Likewise, Reload had about 200k players at the time spread across its variants. On Sunday, Epic even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdhHZ8yOxz/?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promoted the game on its social channels</a>.</p><p>In terms of how it stacks up against other Creative maps, Steal the Brainrot is only the third Creative island to pull at least 183k concurrent players. The top mark ever comes courtesy of the deathmatch map Super Red vs Blue, which had 235k players at once in May.</p><p>It's hard to say exactly why Steal the Brainrot blew up like it did on Sunday, but the mode has been steadily popular since it launched in early July. The Roblox version, called Steal a Brainrot, is currently Roblox's <a href="https://www.roblox.com/charts#/sortName/top-playing-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">third most-popular game</a>, as it regularly averages <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/109983668079237/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than a million players</a> at a time. Considering the <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3064994/roblox-stock-tanks-after-surge-of-lawsuits-and-global-bans?r=caf6fe0e0db70d936033da5461e60141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive amount of legal heat Roblox is facing</a> at the moment, it could be that Fortnite is catching some players who are leaving that much more popular metaverse experience.</p>

That includes support for HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections, a multi-function roller and 11 control buttons for easy access to your most-used controls, and textured doubleshot PBT keycaps that are built to be more durable than standard ABS caps. It also benefits from up to 980 hours of battery life, so you should always be ready for your next gaming session.</span></p><p>It should also come as no surprise that the keyboard is littered with RGB lights, so you can light it up with millions of different colors. Some games are integrated with Razer Chroma, allowing them to automatically change the lighting based on the in-game situation.</p><p>Razer rounds out the BlackWidow V4 Low Profile with a top-mounted steel plate for added durability, internal foam for reduced reverberation, and a low front height of just 18.5mm. So if you enjoy the slim form-factor of low-profile keyboards, this looks to combine the tiny footprint with the impressive gaming chops of the much larger V4 keyboards.</p><p>Opt for yellow switches to get a 1.2mm actuation distance requiring 40g of force, or the orange switches for a 1.6mm actuation distance requiring 45g of force.

However, it's missing the numpad, giving you a smaller footprint and freeing up space on your desk for sweeping mouse movements. You'll also lose a few control buttons (dropping from 11 to 3). It's a great option for a dedicated gaming station (or folks working with limited desktop real estate), and it doesn't hurt that you'll save $30, too.</span></p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>The Low Profile lineup joins several existing BlackWidow V4 keyboards. If the above options look enticing but you're not looking for a low-profile layout, consider exploring the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH7V1TRN,B0FH87T8S7,B0FH7QJ6QQ,B0FH7QYNRP,B0BV4BC7LV,B0BT3VC25K,B0D4NMMFXB,B0FCVB8QNR,B0DVDGC52L,B0CG7HQRCY,B0C8QYB8W6,B0FD5276Z6,B0CCFY349S,B0CCG2KHCB,B0DD5Q6XX9&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many other models available in the lineup</a>.

While it's pricier than other models, that premium price tag is worth it based on our experience. The keyboard uses an aluminium chassis, doubleshot ABS keycaps, and an assortment of cool extras like features per-key RGB lighting, a magnetic plush wrist rest (also with RGB underglow lighting), and eight programmable macro keys. It's also available in three switch options, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BT3VC25K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0D4NMMFXB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BV4BC7LV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yellow</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for a wireless option, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable/dp/B0FD5276Z6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackWidow V4 TKL Wireless</a> model that's available for $180, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DD5Q6XX9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">V4 Mini Wireless</a> for $130. Both keyboards are smaller-sized models with fewer keys and streamlined layouts, making for a much more compact footprint on your desk--a nice complement to their wireless designs. The TKL option is slightly larger, while the mini is the smallest option available.</p><p>There's also the BlackWidow V4 X, a wired full-size keyboard available in multiple color options, including themed editions.

                <p>PlayStation is reportedly planning a live stream, either a State of Play or a showcase, for September.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, who shared the information during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7KYP00kf4GM?si=4ofUddvkpykWVKG0&amp;t=1202">Game Mess Mornings</a>, PlayStation is planning on having a live stream during September. While Grubb said it will most likely be a State of Play and not a showcase, with the latter having a longer run time and more games featured, but he did not rule out a showcase as a possibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Grubb did not discuss any games he had specifically heard would be featured during the live stream, however the information came up during a discussion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/">Fairgames</a>, one of PlayStation's in development live-service games. Grubb said he did not expect Fairgames to make an appearance during the show. Ghost of Yotei releases on October 2, so it could make an appearance during a September State of Play.</p><p dir="ltr">State of Play's typically feature both PlayStation first-party games and third-party partners, so there are tons of games that could potentially appear there. More information about already announced games, like Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> or Housemarque's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/">Saros</a>, the latter of which is slated for 2026, could also get some screen time. Insomniac's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/">Wolverine</a> could also have new information revealed, or another studio could announce an in development game.</p><p>PlayStation has had a rough track record during the PS5 generation when it comes to releasing first-party games. While its single-player output has been slow, the games have been well-received, but its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-admits-its-live-service-games-have-been-rocky-acknowledges-negative-news-about-marathon/1100-6533758/">live-service push has not gone smoothly</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/">Concord getting unreleased and canceled</a>, along with Marathon getting delayed indefinitely, leaving plenty of questions about the console maker's current projects.</p>

                <p>Not all games will land the same in all cultures across the world, and Steam is making a small change to review scores to reflect that. When accessing games with enough scores in your client's selected language, you'll see a separate score for that language alongside other metrics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543" data-ratio="0.22287390029326" data-width="1023" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg"></figure><p>Valve published a news post for this change, which says that "when there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," with review scores displaying based the user's primary language.</p><p>"What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, even for the same game," the post explains.</p><p>With Steam's userbase exploding in places like China, it's not hard to see the utility of this. Things that work in games popular with one culture may not work well in another. Or a game may be written well in its developers' primary language but have a very rough translation--something that won't be relevant to the users who speak that native language.</p><p>This change will take effect for games with more than 2,000 publicly visible reviews, and at least two reviews written in at least one language. The post says Valve "purposely made these thresholds higher than the 10 reviews required to calculate the Overall Review Score" because it wanted to be "pretty confident" in the language-specific score before showing it to other users.</p><p>As shown in the screenshot above, provided by Valve, this isn't meant to take information away from users or manipulate scores. The score still shows the sentiment across all reviews alongside the reviews in your language, as well as all recent reviews, and a deeper language breakdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545" data-ratio="0.74222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg"></figure><p>The post says that Valve it knows any changes to review scores will concern users, and states the company has built a variety of features in User Reviews that can be disabled or enabled, should you want to only see the raw review information.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2/" data-ref-id="5000-128269">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> has been only available on PC and Mac since its release in 2013, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/american-truck-simulator/" data-ref-id="5000-260007">American Truck Simulator</a> has been parked on the same platforms since 2016. Euro Truck Simulator 2 has remained popular on Steam in that time despite its age. Now, both games are heading to to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>PlayStation Network has listed pages for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009049" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10008808" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Truck Simulator</a>, while Xbox added <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/euro-truck-simulator-2/9nlvc6stps52" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the former</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/american-truck-simulator/9nwwkck9kd5f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latter</a> shortly thereafter. Specific release dates have yet to be disclosed.</p><p>Just as the name suggests, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is set in several countries across Europe as players assume the role of a cargo truck driver. As part of the game, players have to manage the costs of each trip while saving money to expand their business, purchase a better truck and even hire additional AI drivers to put a trucking fleet together.</p><p>As the more recent game of the two, American Truck Simulator has a more refined presentation while giving players the option to deliver cargo across iconic locations in the country. The game also has enhanced customization features for players' trucks and trailers, as well as different types of brakes that can be used in the game.</p><p>In 2023, SCS Software accepted ads from real trucking companies that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-trucking-company-is-buying-billboards-in-american-truck-simulator-to-help-recruit-staff/1100-6515039/" data-ref-id="1100-6515039">placed recruitment billboards in American Truck Simulator</a>. Perhaps some of those ads will carry over to the new console ports as well. SCS has also teased that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/227300/view/501707621168840988?snr=1_5_9_" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more news may arrive at Gamescom</a> later this week.</p>

While NetEase plans to release new characters frequently, the Marvel universe has a ton of characters that could be added to the game, with some of the biggest names, like Cyclops, Daredevil, and

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/" data-ref-id="2900-6845">Battlefield 6</a> open beta has officially ended after two weekends of explosive action, and based on the number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-weekend-2-goes-live-with-some-issues-but-still-eclipses-300000-users-on-steam/1100-6533941/">concurrent players on Steam</a> and the slew of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-gets-high-marks-from-digital-foundry/1100-6534010/">reactions online</a>, a lot of people took some time with Battlefield's next installment. One of the main concerns coming out of the beta involves players worried about the average size of multiplayer maps being smaller and more compact like those in the beta--but if recent datamines from the BF community are any indication, those fears appear to be unfounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, images of maps not found in the open beta were datamined from Battlefield Labs, the official community development platform for the Battlefield games. Two maps--one called Mirak Valley, which will be included in the base game; and Eastwood, which will apparently be part of the game's first season of extra content--were found during the datamine, and both maps are considerably larger than the Siege of Cairo map found in the beta. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512" data-ratio="0.60502092050209" data-width="2390" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512"></a><figcaption>A size comparison of the datamined maps versus Siege of Cairo, made by Reddit user u/Happysufigeee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mirak Valley, per the datamine, features a riverbed running through two massive mountain ranges, and it's said to be more than half a kilometer in size. The other map, Eastwood, is said to be set in a country club in California, and it allegedly features a golf course, multiple burned-out houses, and two new vehicles: a golf cart and a boat.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers had addressed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">concerns over map size</a> recently, with producer David Sirland saying that large maps exist, "and the tempo scales accordingly--you'll be able to see soon enough!" However, this is the first time that datamined information seems to back up that claim.</p><p dir="ltr">The Battlefield 6 open beta also made waves with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">fans of the franchise's long-running Rush mode</a>, which was particularly affected by the smaller maps found in the beta. A few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-makes-balance-changes-to-rush-but-its-still-12v12/1100-6533997/">balance changes</a> were made via a hotfix, but players were still upset with what the mode offered throughout the test.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is set to launch October 10 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-let-players-have-cross-play-if-they-want-it/1100-6533699/" data-ref-id="1100-6533699">cross-play available</a> to those who wish to use it. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">Preorders are available now</a> for both the Standard and Phantom editions, the latter of which includes extra in-game skins, currency, and more for $100--compared to the standard edition's $70 price tag.</p>
