                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc R</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">aiders</a> is a high-octane third-person extraction shooter set in a dense city that's teeming with life. While the game isn't going to demand an ultra high-end PC full of the best hardware, you might see your rig struggle in certain areas and during gunfights if your settings aren't properly dialed in.</p><p>You never want to lose all of your gear during a drop due to laggy gameplay or frame drops. To stop that from happening, we have a full list of the optimal PC graphics settings you should be using in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Best graphics settings for Arc Raiders on PC</h2><p>There are a decent number of graphics settings to change in the main menu of Arc Raiders, not to mention all the other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-tips-15-things-to-know-before-you-play/1100-6535635/" data-ref-id="1100-6535635">Arc Raiders tips</a> we have to offer. From our testing, changing even the most basic graphics settings has a huge effect on the amount of frames per second you get, even with a high-end PC. That said, you'll certainly want to see where your FPS is at after changing your settings to see if you need to lower anything further.</p><p>If you're experiencing noticeably low frames or jarring stutters, you might have to take matters outside of Arc Raiders itself. Changing settings in the Nvidia Control Panel or the game's config files in your directory is a way to go beyond lowering every graphics option to its lowest value, and it can have a big impact on your performance.</p><p>For now, though, let's go over the best PC graphics settings for Arc Raiders:</p><ul><li><strong>Window Mode</strong>: Fullscreen</li><li><strong>Display Resolution</strong>: Max resolution of your primary monitor (1920x1080, 2560x1440)</li><li><strong>Nvidia DLSS Frame Generation</strong>: Disabled (adds some input delay, but you can enable it if you're playing on PC with a controller or if you need a jump in FPS)</li><li><strong>Vsync</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Nvidia Reflex Low Latency</strong>: On</li><li><strong>Frame Rate Limit</strong>: Set to your monitor's highest refresh rate (60,144, 240, etc.)</li><li><strong>Upscaled Resolution</strong>: 100%</li><li><strong>Resolution Scaling Method</strong>: Nvidia DLSS / AMD FSR</li><li><strong>DLSS Quality</strong>: Balanced or Performance</li><li><strong>DLSS Model</strong>: CNN</li><li><strong>Field of View</strong>: 80</li><li><strong>Motion Blur</strong>: Disabled</li><li><strong>Nvidia RTX Global Illumination</strong>: Static</li><li><strong>View Distance</strong>: High</li><li><strong>Anti-Aliasing</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Shadows</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Post-Processing</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Texture</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Reflections</strong>: Low</li><li><strong>Foliage</strong>: Medium</li><li><strong>Global Illumination Resolution</strong>: Low</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594223"></a><figcaption>The PC graphics settings in Arc Raiders</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4594223-projectpioneerscreenshot2025.10.30-15.37.40.21.png"></figure><p>In our testing, these settings still provided a clear picture on screen that wasn't blurry and kept all textures looking sharp. However, the performance bump from knocking down a few settings to either "Low" or "Medium" was substantial.</p><p>It's also important to set your Upscaling Method correctly, as that will provide you with the most significant leap in performance. You can also enable Frame Generation if you have a 40 or 50-series Nvidia graphics card, but you might feel some input delay in-game, especially if you're on a mouse and keyboard. However, when enabling Frame Generation, you'll see anywhere from 50 to 100 extra frames, making your game much smoother overall.</p><p>As it usually is with graphics settings on PC, you'll likely want to make some changes based on your performance in Arc Raiders. If you have a lower-end PC, then it's best to simply change every setting to its lowest value, set your upscaling to ultra performance, and maybe make some additional changes outside of the game. This might make your game look worse visually, but you should be able to reach a consistent 60 FPS at the very least.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you have a high-end PC, you can crank some settings up, such as view distance or textures, to give yourself a competitive advantage without sacrificing too much FPS. Use our settings to establish a foundation, head in-game to see your performance, and then make some changes if necessary.</p><p>If you're on keyboard and mouse in Arc Raiders, make sure to check out our other guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-keybinds-and-mouse-settings-in-arc-raiders/1100-6535833/" data-ref-id="1100-6535833">best keybinds and mouse settings</a>.</p>
