                <p>From Software launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> in February 2022, and the game quickly caught on among players. It was a massive hit from the start--so much so that the sales of Elden Ring have almost caught up with From's previous franchise, Dark Souls, in just under three years.</p><p>Bandai Namco has announced that as of September 2024, Elden Ring has sold 28.6 million copies worldwide. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> DLC expansion surely helped raise those numbers in 2024. Before Elden Ring's 2022 release, the Dark Souls games sold 27 million copies combined. This led some observers to suggest that Elden Ring had already surpassed Dark Souls' all-time numbers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fun Fact: The entire Dark Souls series had sold 27 million units combined prior to Elden Ring's release. <br>Now Elden Ring alone has surpassed that total. <a href="https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/Y8yLNzdhfZ</a></p>  — Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1868133441243394315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, that was a premature assessment. The Dark Souls games now have <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/en/ir/library/assets/pdf/2024/factbook2024_en_1-6.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 37 million copies to their name</a>, which means that Elden Ring still has a ways to go before it catches up. But given that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-is-just-20-for-black-friday/1100-6527932/" data-ref-id="1100-6527932">Elden Ring was heavily discounted for Black Friday</a>, it may have closed some of the distance between the two franchises. Bandai Namco hasn't shared those updated numbers yet.</p><p>Surprisingly, From Software <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-2-is-not-happening-at-least-not-yet/1100-6528191/" data-ref-id="1100-6528191">doesn't seem to be in a hurry to make Elden Ring 2</a>. In the meantime, the recently announced co-op game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-for-2025-co-op-action-spin-off/1100-6528435/" data-ref-id="1100-6528435">Elden Right Nightreign</a>, is expected to debut in 2025. While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wont-have-cross-play/1100-6528467/" data-ref-id="1100-6528467">Nightreign won't have cross-play</a>, players on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">will be able to sign up for a test</a> starting early next year.</p>

Image quality issues, persistent performance wobbles, and challenges with the console's exclusive AI-upscaling technology, PSSR have all been noted. A <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-update-notes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new update for the survival-horror game</a> aims to fix most of these issues, some of which boil down to disabling PSSR entirely.</p><p>Alan Wake 2 is the first game to allow players to toggle PSSR on or off, with the game falling back to its previous implementation of AMD's FSR upscaling when disabled. In most instances, PSSR has been an improvement over FSR (which uses linear scaling as opposed to AI-enchanced upscaling), but Alan Wake 2 has been an outlier. In its analysis of the game on PS5 Pro, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-alan-wake-2-how-does-ps5-pro-handle-one-of-the-best-looking-games-of-this-generation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> observed issues with image quality that FSR handled better. It did, however, note that PSSR was overall a better solution.</p>

<p>It's clear then that developer Remedy is giving players the option to decide for themselves, letting them omit one of the biggest features of the PS5 Pro entirely if they choose. Included in the patch is a new 40fps mode, too, which balances the image enhancements found in the PS5 Pro Quality mode and the fluidity of the Performance mode if you have a display that supports 120Hz.</p><p>Further adjustments to image settings have also been made to the Performance mode to stabilize the frame rate, while other tweaks the to game's ray-traced reflections should reduce their overall noisy presentation. The update also includes some smaller changes to DLC content, as well as minor fixes across all platforms. It's available to download now, with the full patch notes listed below.</p><h3>Improvements and additions</h3><ul><li>[PS5 Pro] Added a new “Balanced” graphics mode. This mode requires compatible displays that can achieve a 120Hz refresh rate. The Balanced mode combines PS5 Pro Quality mode settings including raytracing with Performance mode resolution. This mode targets 40fps.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Slightly adjusted visual settings of the Performance mode to achieve a more consistent framerate.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Quality and Balanced mode: Adjusted Raytracing settings to achieve a less noisy image.</li><li>[PS5 Pro] Added an option to toggle PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution) On/Off.</li></ul><h3>Fixes</h3><ul><li>[The Lake House] Fixed manuscript collectables that showed the wrong page in Saga’s Mind Place.</li><li>[The Lake House] Fixed “Welcome to the Lake House” video collectable missing audio.</li><li>Minor fixes and optimizations.</li></ul>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> was rated 18+ by PEGI, the classification board in charge of game ratings across Europe. Developer LocalThunk has resurfaced frustration over the rating, joking in a series of tweets that it should add "real gambling" to lower its rating down to 3+, like the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-ref-id="5000-635887">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>In <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111242" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PEGI's reasoning for the rating</a>, the board singles out the use of real-life poker hands in Balatro, stating that its inclusion could teach players its mechanics for use in real gambling. Despite poker just being the basis for Balatro's roguelite gameplay, PEGI says its prominent gambling imagery is deserving of its highest Adults Only rating. This rating isn't new either--earlier this year, it was the reason Balatro was suddenly pulled from several console storefronts, as its previous 3+ rating was changed overnight without prior notice.</p><p>LocalThunk hasn't let it go, citing a game that several European countries have previously deemed to have gambling elements. EA Sport FC 25 contains the same microtransactions and loot-box mechanics that have been in the series ever since Ultimate Team was first announced, but has maintained its 3+ "suitable for all ages" rating. LocalThunk points to this specifically as a double standard, even joking that Balatro should incorporate the same mechanics in order to get its rating lowered.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Since PEGI gave us an 18+ rating for having evil playing cards maybe I should add microtransactions/loot boxes/real gambling to lower that rating to 3+ like EA sports FC</p>  — localthunk (@LocalThunk) <a href="https://twitter.com/LocalThunk/status/1868142749108797590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>LocalThunk continued to say that the issue wasn't necessarily with Balatro's own rating, but that other more blatant examples of "gambling mechanics for children" should be similarly clamped down on. "The red logo looks kinda dope," concluded the developer.</p><p>Balatro's rating hasn't stopped its meteoric success since launch. The game has sold over 3.5 million copies, and won several awards at last week's The Game Awards show. The captivating roguelite is also one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/#3" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's top 10 games of 2024</a>.</p>
