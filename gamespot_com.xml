                <p dir="ltr">King Slime might not rule over much, but they’re royalty nonetheless, as they’re the first boss most players encounter in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503" data-mce-href="/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> and the one most likely to squash you when you least expect it. Big, blue, and bouncy, this gelatinous monarch is the perfect entry point for testing your mettle, dropping some handy loot and setting the tone for boss battles to come.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more dramatic foes lurking deeper in Terraria’s layers, King Slime is pretty casual about the way in which it appears, showing up if you poke it the right way or sometimes just crashing the party on its own. Although entirely optional, defeating it is often the first step towards serious progression, unlocking early mobility options and giving newer players a clear combat checkpoint. Here’s how to summon and beat King Slime in Terraria.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to prepare for King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">While King Slime isn’t exactly Moon Lord material, it still pays to come prepared. The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/" data-ref-id="1100-6532648" data-mce-href="/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria boss</a> might be a glorified blue blob, but it’s one that teleports, spawns minions, and can flatten you like a professional pancake chef if you’re caught off guard.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523258"></a><figcaption>Using a gun against King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523258-how-to-summon-king-slime-gun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Make sure you’ve got at least copper-tier or better armor - packing wood armor is pushing your luck, and vanity-only setups are asking for a swift respawn screen. You might get away with melee weapons if you’re feeling brave or fancy a particularly tall challenge, but your best bet at this early stage is to equip a ranged weapon to keep your distance. Shurikens work well, but my pick is a bow with flaming arrows, as you can craft your ammo by hand using standard arrows and torches. As for accessories, finding a grappling hook and Hermes Boots from Underground and Cavern chests will help you maintain momentum.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like all Terraria bosses, life is much easier when making a platform arena ahead of the fight. Hack a few trees down with your axe, and you’ll soon have enough wood to craft the blocks by hand. You’ll need to anchor the first wooden platform onto something, such as stone, but once you’ve started extending, you can remove the initial placement without the whole thing collapsing. The further you go, the simpler it is to kite the King and avoid getting boxed in by blue slimes.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to spawn King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">There are a few ways to get the royal jelly rolling, and none of them require a regal invitation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523262"></a><figcaption>Use a Slime Crown to summon King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523262-how-to-summon-king-slime-crown.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime spawns in three different ways:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Use a Slime Crown -</strong> Crafted at a Demon or Crimson Altar with 1 Gold/Platinum Crown and 20 Gel. Crowns are made from 1 Ruby + 5 Gold/Platinum bars at an anvil. Simple, clean, and entirely under your control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Naturally spawn during Slime Rain -</strong> This random weather event causes slimes to fall from the sky. If you defeat enough, King Slime may drop in unexpectedly. It’s fashionably late, but will always show up towards the end if you meet the 150 slime quota</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Random spawn -</strong> On rare occasions, King Slime just spawns because he feels like it. You’ll either need to roam the outer edges of your world to the far left or right, particularly near forests, but you might stumble into an accidental boss fight. Just make sure it’s daytime, you’re on the surface, and there’s grass nearby</li></ul><p dir="ltr">King Slime has a few tricks: it teleports if you get too far away, bounces faster when its health drops, and constantly spits out blue slimes to keep you distracted. It’s also one of the few bosses that can despawn easily if you run too far or die, so don’t stray too far mid-fight.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to beat King Slime</h2><p dir="ltr">Keep your distance. King Slime is massive, slow, and easy to predict, but if you stand still for too long, it’ll hop right on top of you. Use platform layers or rope elevators to move vertically, and pepper it with ranged attacks. It only teleports when you're far away, so keep within a few blocks if you’re going to melee and want to avoid surprise jellification.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4523257"></a><figcaption>Attacking King Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4523257-how-to-summon-king-slime-terraria-attack.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Clear the blue slimes as they spawn, especially in Expert or Master Mode, where crowd control becomes critical. This prevents your arena from becoming a trampoline death trap. If you’re using flaming arrows, shurikens, or even early magic weapons like the Wand of Sparking, aim for sustained damage per second (DPS) and keep kiting.</p><p dir="ltr">When fighting with friends, designate a tank to hold his attention while ranged players pelt from above. It has no phase changes, just increased aggression and movement speed as it slowly shrinks from the damage it takes. Don’t panic when it gets faster. That just means you’re close to victory.</p><h2 dir="ltr">King Slime drops and rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">Defeating King Slime nets you a royal helping of goodies, particularly useful for early exploration. None are essential for progressing, but nice to have in preparation for your next fight.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Classic Drops</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Solidifier</strong> - Lets you craft slime-themed furniture</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Gun</strong> - A bit useless but completely fun, giving you the ability to inflict the Slime debuff on both enemies and friendly NPCs alike</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slime Hook</strong> - A grapple hook styled blue after the King</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Slimy Saddle</strong> - Ride around on your own mini Slime. It’s faster, jumps far higher than you can, and even float on water</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja Armour Pieces</strong> - Helmet, shirt, and pants drop individually, affording decent movement bonuses and a stylish headband to boot</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Trophy</strong> - Commemorate your victory with a wall hanging</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Mask</strong> - A vanity item that plonks a blue bubble on your head</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Gel</strong> - Makes crafting a little easier, especially when making torches, sticky glowsticks, bombs, or the Slime Crown you’ll use to summon the King.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Expert and Master Mode Drops</h3><p dir="ltr">All Classic drops apply to Expert and Master Modes, but these harder versions of Terraria boss fights give you extra rewards to aim for:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Gel</strong> - An accessory that makes most regular slimes friendly. Consider it an early-game peace treaty</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Coins -</strong> Not glamorous, but everyone loves a bit of pocket change</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>King Slime Relic</strong> (Master Mode-only) - A golden piece of furniture to celebrate your win</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Royal Delight</strong> (Master Mode-only) - Summon the Slime Prince as your pet, right after you kill its father</li></ul><p>Beating King Slime also ticks off an early-game milestone: it earns you the Slippery Shinobi achievement, unlocks a Bestiary entry, and gets you one step closer to conquering Terraria’s ever-escalating gauntlet of chaos.</p>

Ubisoft has yet to officially announce Black Flag's return to modern consoles and PC, but voice actor Matt Ryan recently hinted that a remake is on the way.</p><p>On social media, an X user going by @TheRealZephryss shared a video from <a href="https://x.com/SuperDropKick17" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@SuperDropKick17</a> that features Ryan signing autographs at a convention. Ryan--who voiced Black Flag's leading character, Edward Kenway--was asked if he had beaten the game and he affirmed that he had. Ryan then noted that he may need to beat the game again. "There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything," added Ryan.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/therealzephryss/status/1939392046151926243?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction.

One of the bug fixes will also make the Estimated VRAM Usage display the correct amount in Display Settings and Graphics Settings.</p><p>It's too soon to say whether these changes alone will turn things around for Wilds on Steam, but Capcom notes that further performance and optimization improvements are still in the works. Across all platforms, Free Title Update is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-lagiacrus-seregios-and-underwater-combat/1100-6532767/" data-ref-id="1100-6532767">adding two new monsters</a>, Lagiacrus and Seregios, as well as underwater combat.</p><p>Some of the smaller changes in this update include easier access to the map, which can now be opened even when major chat notifications are on the screen. Wilds will no longer be automatically switching to area hierarchy when players are focused on the large monsters on the map.</p><p>Weapon balance changes have been made for Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun, with more adjustments to be added in August. Looking ahead to Free Title Update 3, Capcom expects to release it in September with a new level of quest difficulty with unique rewards which can be used for a new Talisman crafting system. The Talismans can be "assigned a wide variety of skills," including some related directly to weapons and armor. Free Title Update 4 will follow in the winter with another new monster and "more challenging elements."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1938591901378040197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">[Future Update Plans]<br>So far, we have discussed what we will be addressing in the second Free Title Update, however we feel there are still many points of feedback and requests to address.

It follows the 2021 remake of Cyan's most famous and influential game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/myst/" data-ref-id="5000-518993">Myst</a>. Both remakes are currently available at a discount in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-summer-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-6667/" data-ref-id="2900-6667">Steam Summer Sale</a>.</p><p>Cyan has a long history in the games industry, having operated as an independent studio for some 37 years. Myst, first released in 1993, had a massive cultural impact both within and outside of video games, releasing alongside the growing trend of owning a home PC in the U.S. Since then, Myst has spawned four sequels, as well as comics and novels.</p>
