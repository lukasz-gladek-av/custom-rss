                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mario Kart DS is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 14, 2025. Below, we examine how the fan community has kept the game alive, and online, long after official servers were retired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Mario Kart DS launched in 2005, it felt like a glimpse into the future. For the first time, Nintendo’s chaotic, shell-filled racer could be played online, pitting players from around the world against each other in real-time competition. It was a leap few handheld games had dared to make at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades later, the official Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers that powered those matchups are long gone, but the race never really stopped. Through fan-built tools, open-source servers, and emulation projects, Mario Kart DS remains alive and well--still spinning its wheels in the hands of a dedicated community that refuses to let it drift into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Nintendo DS debuted, it was marketed as a “third pillar” for the company--a strange, dual-screen experiment meant to sit alongside the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. But with Mario Kart DS, the touch screen rarely came into play. The game focused the series’ easy-to-pick-up gameplay with a forward-thinking approach that accelerated Mario Kart into the future. GameSpot, in fact, loved the game in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mario Kart DS is without a doubt one of the best games to hit the Nintendo DS to date," GameSpot's reviewer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-ds-review/1900-6139765/">wrote</a>. "The game plays every bit as well as any of its predecessors, and adds just enough new features to the mix to make it worthy of your attention, even if you're still playing any of those games on a regular basis. The online play is undoubtedly the icing on an especially yummy cake, and even if you're not in a position to sample said icing, a yummy cake without icing is still a yummy cake."</p><p dir="ltr">Using Nintendo’s Wi-Fi Connection service, players could race online via local hotspots or home internet connections. It wasn’t perfect--online matchmaking was limited to a handful of tracks, and finding friends required clunky friend codes--but it was enough to ignite a new kind of competition. Suddenly, players could test their drifting skills against strangers halfway across the globe. For many, it was their first taste of online console gaming at all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC4Ohj0jdBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pC4Ohj0jdBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond its online capabilities, Mario Kart DS also raised the bar for what handheld racing could be. It introduced retro cups, reimagining classic tracks from previous entries. It popularized snaking, a technique where skilled players could chain boosts by quickly alternating drifts, giving the game a competitive depth.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo shut down its Wi-Fi Connection servers in 2014, it seemed like the end of an era. Online play for Mario Kart DS--and dozens of other Nintendo titles--was suddenly gone. But like any good racer, fans found a way to take a shortcut.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just found a way to play Mario Kart DS online again. It's really cool that you can still do this,' one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartDS/comments/1cfjera/playing_mario_kart_ds_online_in_2024/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2024. "It's not as active as the Wii, but it's actually pretty easy to find a match."</p><p dir="ltr">Through reverse engineering and open-source initiatives like Wiimmfi and AltWFC, the game’s online features were kept alive by the community. Players could still race together. The process wasn’t always simple--it required custom patches or modified DNS settings--but it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, fan communities continue to organize races and tournaments. Whenever players went online to post that they found a new way to play Mario kart DS online, but that they couldn't find other players, other Mario Kart DS fans pointed them towards a thriving <a href="https://discord.gg/mario-kart-ds-network-569870981213061120" rel="nofollow ">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of community and legacy is what drives many of these projects. In an era where online games can disappear with the flip of a server switch, Mario Kart DS has become a case study in fan-powered preservation. It’s proof that players can keep a game alive long after its corporate support ends--through passion, a little technical skill, and sheer determination.</p><p dir="ltr">Even by today’s standards, Mario Kart DS feels remarkably tight. Its track design, item balance, and snappy controls strike a near-perfect blend of skill and chaos. The game’s focus on pure mechanics--no anti-gravity, bikes, motion controls, or touch-screen gameplay--makes it a favorite for players who crave the series’ classic feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Its simplicity is part of its staying power. Modern entries like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World are spectacular in scope, but DS captures a more stripped-down energy--a focus on short bursts of fun that perfectly fit the handheld format. Races are quick, items are well-tuned, and the roster, while smaller with 12 standard racers including most of Mario's immediate family, friends, and rivals, is iconic.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s also a game that rewards mastery. Snaking and mini-turbo management turned what looked like a casual party racer into a surprisingly deep competitive title. The best players could maintain near-constant boosts, flying through tracks with dizzying speed. Nintendo eventually toned this down in later games, but among longtime fans, Mario Kart DS remains the “technical” entry--the one that truly separated the pros from the pack.</p><p dir="ltr">As Mario Kart DS turns 20, its community, while small, is firmly in cruise control. Players continue to introduce newcomers to its underground online scene. For many, keeping the game alive isn’t just nostalgia--it’s a statement about access in the digital age.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Mario Kart will likely continue to evolve, beyond the sandbox experiment of Mario Kart World and the fun augmented reality of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. But in many ways, Mario Kart DS set the standard. It proved that online play could work on a handheld and that great design never goes out of style.</p><p dir="ltr">Twenty years on, the finish line isn't even on the track. The race, at least for now, feels endless. The drivers are still out hugging turns on Delfino Square and dodging obstacles on Waluigi Pinball with their feet firmly planted on the gas pedal.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image Credit: XCageGame on YouTube</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO. But Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has stated the series started with multiplayer in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-for-buildin-jest/1900-6418316/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> was apparently Guerilla dipping its toes in the water with multiplayer, according to van Beek <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>. But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," wrote van Beek. "Lego Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we're excited to show you what is coming."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. <br>LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one.

That would be a first for the franchise, as even the spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/" data-ref-id="1900-6418028">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> was released for PlayStation VR 2. The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, arguing the game is a "slavish clone" of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/">reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a live-action Horizon movie in the works</a>, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.</p>

                <p>Valve has a new Steam Machine on the way next year, but if you have a long memory, you'll remember that this isn't the first time that the company has attempted to bring PC gaming to the living room. The original line of Steam Machine mini-PCs launched back in 2015, but poor sales eventually saw these devices fade quietly into the background. So what's to stop history from repeating itself? According to Valve, a better video game catalogue and an effort to give developers an easier time when porting games over to the new Steam Machine are some of the key factors that the company has focused on.</p><p>"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier. So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux that are originally meant for Windows," engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I think it's really about the games catalogue," fellow engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais added. "Being able to control your TV, boot directly into the game, launch games, and install them in a way that meant you didn't have to install drivers, or that you didn't have to clean up your system after you installed and uninstalled a couple of games--all of those elements were there. We just didn't have a really compelling games library."</p><p>Griffais explained that developers also wanted to be assured that there would be an audience for their games to justify the effort spent on porting them, and that Valve worked on creating a machine that could reliably run games on it and offer an impressive layer of performance. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-says-steam-machine-has-overlap-with-traditional-consoles-but-its-not-one/1100-6536196/">In another interview</a>, Griffais mentioned how Valve was aiming to make PC gaming "work better" in the living room, a space traditionally dominated by video game consoles.</p><p>The Steam Machine is currently scheduled to launch in 2026--alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/">new Steam Controller and Steam Frame VR headset</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/">but pricing for it has not yet been revealed</a>. Valve has said that it wants the Steam Machine to be "affordable," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-is-the-steam-machine-even-for-industry-expert-weighs-in/1100-6536186/">and one industry expert</a> believes that price "sweet spot" could be $400.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-server-status-is-black-ops-7-down/1100-6535171/" data-ref-id="1100-6535171">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is finally here</a>, and one of the main pieces of feedback from players thus far is around the game's aim-assist feature. Aim-assist is nothing new in Call of Duty (and many other games), but people are saying developer Treyarch went too far with the changes to aim-assist following the beta. Other people say it's great.</p><h2><strong>What Treyarch said about aim-assist changes</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Treyarch said its goal was to "create a more balanced and competitive experience for all players, regardless of input choice." Another important element for Treyarch was to "preserve the core feel of Call of Duty controller gameplay."</p><p>Based on feedback from the beta test, Treyarch said it learned that people playing on controllers have a slight advantage to win shootouts at close range. Keyboard and mouse setups, meanwhile, displayed a statistical advantage at long ranges.</p><p>Treyarch went on to say it also monitored player feedback on rotational aim-assist and made changes for launch based on that. "Based on the data and feedback, our launch adjustments focus on the strength of rotational aim-assist at short and long range, as well as the requirements to fully activate rotational aim-assist," Treyarch said.</p><h2><strong>What players are saying</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 players just getting started with the game have shared their opinions on the aim-assist changes online. Professional player <a href="https://x.com/CoDClipped/status/1988971829537697825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shotzzy</a> said, "I feel like I have no aim-assist. I'm not even trolling." Others have said it's the <a href="https://x.com/Follow_Henrique/status/1988953891422236768" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"dumbest decision"</a> to change aim-assist in this way. Other people have said <a href="https://x.com/xcellerations/status/1989101650523636131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dialing back aim-assist in this way shows how good you really are at Call of Duty</a>, and that can be humbling. A lot of people are <a href="https://x.com/PhantXmBLXZE/status/1989261492454293781" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">enjoying and embracing the aim-assist changes</a>. As usual with any given topic on the internet, opinions are all over the place.</p><h2><strong>Could Treyarch change aim-assist?</strong></h2><p>Black Ops 7 is a live multiplayer game and Treyarch has the ability to make ongoing changes, and that could happen based on feedback. "We look forward to hearing your feedback on these changes, and we will be gathering more data to continue our push for a level and competitive playing field in Black Ops 7," Treyarch said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>
