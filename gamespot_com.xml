Super Mario fans can add <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amiibo-Koopa-Troopa-Super-Mario/dp/B071K9MTPY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Koopa Troopa</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-NVLCABAR-Amiibo-Goomba-Super/dp/B071K9MZ6P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Goomba Amiibo</a></strong> to their collections for $16 each. Both characters are shipped and sold by Amazon, so we wouldn't expect Mario's iconic punching bags to remain in stock for very long. Goomba and Koopa Troopa are part of the long-dormant Super Mario Amiibo series.</p><p>Both figures released in the US in October 2017 and were sold out at Amazon by time the calendar flipped to 2018. The regular price of Nintendo Switch Amiibo recently increased to $20, so you're technically saving 20% on Koopa Troopa and Goomba.

Players can unlock Gold Koopa Troopa and themed stamp sheets for Bowser's Minions and the mainline story mode. Koopa Troopa is compatible with several other Mario games for 3DS. And yes, in case you were wondering, Wario is bad at drawing Koopa Troopa, too.</p><p>On Switch, Koopa Troopa functions similarly to Goomba in Smash Bros. Ultimate, Bowser's Fury, Bayonetta 2, and Super Mario Party. You'll unlock the Koopa Troopa Spirit in Smash Bros., but since a shiny Koopa sticker doesn't exist in Super Mario Party, it unlocks the Goomba sticker (if you don't already have it).</p><p>Koopa Troopa also unlocks exclusive costumes in two additional games: Conga Master Party and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+%2420+Or+More+On+Mario+RPGs+For+Nintendo+Switch+This+Week&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-08-25+23%3A40%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-25+23%3A40%3A27&amp;fnarticle_id=6533821&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FYoshi-s-Crafted-World-Nintendo-Switch-Physical-Edition%2F449117242%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-nintendo-switch-games-hit-all-time-low-prices-at-walmart%2F1100-6533821%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Crafted World</a>.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Goombas and Koopa Troopas have been franchise fixtures since the original Super Mario Bros. debuted in 1985 on the Nintendo Entertainment System.</p><p>In World 1-1, the first few obstacles Mario encounters are the ever-grumpy mushrooms with feet. After flattening a handful of Goombas by jumping on their heads, Mario meets the perpetually smiling tortoise for the first time. There's only one Koopa in World 1-1, but that's enough to introduce players to the more efficient method for eliminating Goombas. Over the past 40 years, Super Mario fans have hurled countless Koopa Shells at groups of Goombas.</p><p>Nintendo has iterated on Bowser's original henchmen on many occasions, but you can still count on seeing regular Koopas and Goombas in the vast majority of Super Mario Bros platformers and spin-offs.

with a disc drive, the limited edition faceplates, and the Ghost of Yotei Edition DualSense controller. As mentioned above, there will be two versions available--a gold version and a black version. Both feature all the same artwork and include the same accessories. The only difference is the color scheme. You can preorder the black version exclusively at PlayStation Direct starting September 4 at 10 a.m. local time, while the gold version will be available at PlayStation Direct and select other storefronts--though specific retailer availability has not be announced. Either way, Sony says these bundles will only be available in limited quantities, so if you’re looking to grab one, you’ll want to be ready for when preorders open.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ghost+Of+Yotei+Limited+Edition+PS5+Gear+Preorders+Begin+September+4&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-27+16%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-27+16%3A47%3A07&amp;fnarticle_id=6534326&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dghost%2520of%2520yotei%2520ps5&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-gear-preorders-begin-september-4%2F1100-6534326%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click">PS5 Slim and PS5 Pro Console Covers -

                <p>Every time Hello Games is readying an update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, studio founder Sean Murray tweets out cryptic emoji that send the community's head spinning. For the <a href="http://nomanssky.com/voyagers-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Voyagers update</a>, he posted a waving emoji, followed by a group of three waving emoji to hint at the major feature of the update: ships big enough to travel around in with your friends.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHZLz1MW0aE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qHZLz1MW0aE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Voyagers update brings Corvette-class ships to the galaxy. Where the one-seater ships we've piloted thus far are pretty limited in customization, you'll build your Corvette "piece by piece" with full customization, meaning that your ship will be truly unique. You'll be able to customize both the inside and outside, designing the ship through a ship-designer menu that doesn't seem that different from Starfield's version. The update even includes different interior styles and cockpits, so that you can make your ship feel like the Millennium Falcon, filled with readouts and switches, or go for something more streamlined like Star Trek. There are a bunch of working ship modules that will enhance the functionality and stats of your ship, too, so this isn't purely cosmetic.</p><p>Once built, you can get out of your chair and walk around the inside. If you hop on with friends, you can travel the galaxy together, all in one ship.</p><p>There's even a new spacewalking mechanic to let you step out the airlock of your Corvette, to float around in space or jump from your Corvette to your friend's.</p><p>The update also adds graphical enhancements to glass, to player lighting, and more, along with DLSS 4 compatibility.</p><p>And of course, Hello Games also saw fit to add an Expedition to the game to speed up initial ship building.</p><h2>No Man's Sky Voyagers Update Patch Notes</h2><h3>Corvette-class Starships</h3><ul><li>Added a new class of starship, the Corvette. Corvettes are large, fully bespoke ships with furnished interiors, capable of accommodating multiple passengers.</li><li>A lightweight tutorial for assembling your first Corvette will activate upon first collecting a Corvette module or interacting with the Corvette Workshop.</li><li>A large catalogue of snappable structural and decorative modules is available for Corvette assembly, including habitation modules, hulls, wings, engines, windows, accessways, weapons, reactors, shield generators, connectors and decorative peripherals.</li><li>Corvette modules can be unearthed from salvage containers buried on worlds across the universe, as well as discovered in Derelict Freighters.</li><li>Modules can also sometimes be retrieved from defeated pirates, freighter cargo pods, crashed freighter crates, frigate expeditions, or received as rewards for completing missions.</li><li>Structural Corvette modules are collected individually in the inventory and spent directly when assembling a Corvette.</li><li>While standing within a Corvette, specialised furnishings and a selection of base decorations can be installed in the ship's interior. Internal modules can be installed without limitation, but require resources to construct.</li><li>Habitation modules ("habs") form the main living area for Corvette-class starships. Habs are available in three distinct classes: Titan, Thunderbird, and Ambassador, each with its own sci-fi aesthetic. Installed furnishings reflect the style of their hab, and multiple habs placed adjacently are automatically linked with doorways.</li><li>Multi-storey Corvettes can be assembled with the installation of internal stairways.</li><li>Several installable Corvette modules have practical functionality, such as the Living Wall, Nutrition Unit, Refiner Unit and Mission Radar.</li><li>A number of Corvette modules are linked to technology upgrades, automatically improving the Corvette's stats alongside its appearance.</li><li>Corvette Workshop terminals can be found aboard the Space Station. These terminals provide an interface through which collected Corvette modules can be assembled into a pilotable, habitable starship.</li><li>The terminal also provides access to a shop for purchasing basic Corvette modules, and a barter interface for trading advanced Corvette modules.</li><li>The Corvette Workshop can store a draft Corvette, allowing work-in-progress edits to be saved and returned to at a later time.</li><li>A nearby cache will collect any overflow of refunded Corvette modules if there are too many to store in the player's inventory.</li><li>The Corvette benefits from an especially powerful pulse drive, which moves faster than single-occupancy ships.</li><li>Corvettes can autopilot to space stations, discovered planets, and mission destinations.</li><li>Corvettes can also be set to autopilot along the current flightpath.</li><li>Corvette accessways are accompanied by a specialised teleporter, allowing the ship to hover above especially mountainous or difficult terrain, while passengers beam themselves to and from the planetary surface.</li><li>Added support for multiple physics worlds, enabling players to travel stably and walk on foot around fast-moving Corvettes.</li><li>Spacewalking is now a fully supported mode of navigation, allowing players to leave their ships (or freighters) and use their jetpack to fly among the stars.</li><li>Added a number of Corvette-specific visual effects for engines and landing.</li><li>Added new audio effects and ambient environments for Corvettes.</li><li>Added specialised camera handling for piloting Corvettes and navigating their interiors.</li></ul><h3>Corvette Multiplayer Missions</h3><ul><li>Added a Corvette-based mission board, allowing players on board the Corvette to register as mission crew to co-operatively complete objectives in the local system and earn rewards and standing.</li></ul><h3>Corvette Expedition</h3><ul><li>Expedition Nineteen, Corvette, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li><li>Rewards include new posters, decals and titles, the vigilant jetpack trail and plasma starship trail, an exclusive deadeye cannon module for Corvettes, and the unique Mecha-Mouse robotic companion.</li></ul><h3>Skyborn Exosuit and Jetpack</h3><ul><li>Added the 5-piece Skyborn Exosuit to the Appearance Modifier, including armour, gloves, boots, legs and torso customisations.</li><li>Added the Skyborn Jetpack to the Appearance Modifier.</li></ul><h3>Twitch Drops</h3><ul><li>A new package of Twitch drops will begin shortly. Sign up and connect your platform accounts on the Twitch Drops page, then tune in to Twitch to earn exotic base parts, high-tech starships, fireworks, appearance modifications, and more.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay and Quality of Life</h3><ul><li>Implemented support for rebinding controls on console.</li><li>Rearranged a number of input bindings in the controls menu for improved usability.</li><li>Added a graphics option to adjust the strength of blurring / light scattering on distant objects in underwater environments.</li><li>On PC and MacOS, added text translations for system-level dialog boxes (for example, when the operating system reports a graphics driver error).</li><li>Improved the visibility of the "Switch Base" control, for selecting which base to edit while within the perimeter of multiple planetary bases, or within both a planetary base and a Corvette.</li><li>Added the ability to copy and paste No Man's Sky Friend Codes on PC and MacOS.</li><li>Improved the appearance of several dialog boxes on the boot and pause screens.</li><li>Added “scroll on hover” functionality to a number of UI buttons that could overspill in non-English languages.</li><li>Improved the mouse scroll speed in the base building menu.</li><li>Increased the number of planets featuring buried ancient bones.</li><li>Increased the number of planets featuring buried salvageable scrap.</li><li>Salvageable scrap containers are no longer guarded by corrupt Sentinels.</li><li>Prevented Echo Locator hint notifications from appearing when a harmonic camp was already locally marked, or while within the perimeter of a camp.</li><li>Improved the system for displaying the estimated remaining time to a destination on HUD markers, resulting in much more accurate time estimates and tick-down speed.</li><li>The landing pad readout at the Space Anomaly now indicates where your ship is docked, and accurately reflects landing space availability.</li><li>Robotic creatures now lay metal eggs.</li></ul><h3>Rendering</h3><ul><li>Added support for NVIDIA DLSS4. Deep Learning Super Sampling is a revolutionary suite of neural rendering technologies that uses AI to boost FPS, reduce latency, and improve image quality.</li><li>Added support for PlayStation® Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), improving image clarity using AI-enhanced resolution, for ultra-high definition and incredible detail.</li><li>Added support for Intel Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) 2, which uses machine learning to deliver higher performance with exceptional image quality.</li><li>Implemented moment-based order-independent transparency (MBOIT), improving the appearance of translucent surfaces, especially when overlapping.</li><li>Added localised "hero lighting" for the player character, improving their appearance in darker environments.</li><li>Improved the rendering and lighting of 3D objects such as the player's ship, Multi-Tool and jetpack on the inventory screen.</li><li>Improved the appearance of glowing distant objects.</li><li>Improved the rendering of semi-transparent mesh particles.</li><li>Improved the appearance of cloud shadows, making them denser and more dramatic.</li><li>Improved the visual stability of heavy air effects, resolving some flickering issues.</li></ul><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that could cause multiple NPC ships to land at the same dock.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause creatures to teleport onto terrain when navigating underground caverns.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause some sections of Autophage staffs to remain visible when the player entered a short-range teleporter.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the "Open Building" button on a Settlement building to be incorrectly greyed out, even when available.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause some frigate fleet log entries to be omitted from the final list if the frigate expedition was very long.</li><li>Fixed a rare timing-specific issue that could cause uploaded cross-platform saves to be displayed in the wrong UI style when backing out of the Cross-Save Manager.</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused some Station Core text to appear in the wrong dialog box style.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause terrain to appear visually corrupted on lower-end systems.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause distant objects to flicker in Virtual Reality.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented fishing lines from rendering correctly in multiplayer.</li><li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause player names to appear as "..." in multiplayer.</li><li>Fixed a number of rare multiplayer crashes.</li></ul><h3>Abandoned Mode</h3><ul><li>Added the Mech Hardframe parts to the technology research trees in Abandoned Mode.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented learning the Creature Pellets recipe in Abandoned Mode.</li></ul><h3>Optimisations</h3><ul><li>Implemented occlusion culling on Xbox Series, PS4, and PS5, significantly increasing framerate in indoor environments (such as in caves and planetary buildings).</li><li>Implemented multi-threaded rendering on PC, significantly improving CPU performance, notably in VR.</li><li>Implemented a significant performance optimisation on mature saves with a large number of completed or active missions.</li><li>Implemented a large number of performance optimisations across multiple game systems, including the handling of HUD markers, the physics of static objects such as buildings and rocks, audio, the Analysis Visor, particles, and components that trigger animations or state changes in response to player actions.</li><li>Improved the CPU performance of planetary creatures navigating across terrain.</li><li>Implemented several memory-saving optimisations related to large textures and data table loading.</li><li>Significantly improved load times when loading saves near large planetary bases.</li><li>Further reduced the number of shaders used by the game, improving load times.</li></ul>

                <p>Cult filmmaker John Carpenter seems to have been having a moment at Gamescom 2025. Not only does his name grace the title for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zombie-swarms-and-vehicle-tech-make-john-carpenters-toxic-commando-more-than-just-another-co-op-fps/1100-6534250/" data-ref-id="1100-6534250">Toxic Commando</a>, Saber Interactive's fun evolution of the zombie co-op FPS, but his sci-fi horror, The Thing, is also a key influence of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/directive-8020s-narrative-fast-travel-feels-like-a-boon-for-completionists/1100-6534319/" data-ref-id="1100-6534319">Directive 8020</a>. Topping it off, it was during the show where the previously announced Halloween, based on the horror classic with Carpenter himself attached as executive producer, had its first trailer it was announced that his defining slasher horror classic Halloween is being turned into a game, with Carpenter himself attached as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">Given it's being developed by Illfonic--the studio behind other licensed horror or horror-adjacent games like Friday the 13th, Killer Klowns from Outer Space, Predator, and Ghostbusters--in collaboration with Gun Media, Compass International Pictures, and Further Front, it shouldn't be a surprise to learn that this will consist of asymmetrical multiplayer. But this isn't just going to be Friday the 13th: The Game swapping out Jason Vorhees for Michael Myers. For one, the announcement confirms that Halloween will be both a single-player and multiplayer horror experience.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Although Friday the 13th did technically feature single-player content, these were essentially challenge missions that featured no narrative. Sitting down with design director Jordan Mathewson, he explains that this is very much a story mode experience that the studio is working on with Pollard Studio, the Shanghai-based studio behind Karma: The Dark World. "It does have narrative and cinematic components to really give it a lot of story and exploration into what it is doing," he says. "But we've also been building a lot and iterating in a way that allows us to build a type of experience that stands apart from multiplayer and give you a completely different look at what this type of game can be."</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, apart from the announcement trailer, there has been no further reveal of the gameplay--not even behind closed doors--and so it's still too early to have a clear idea of what to expect from Halloween's story mode, apart from that it will put you in the boots and behind the mask of Michael Myers. But from what I'm able to learn from Matthewson, it sounds deliciously like a serial killer's version of Hitman.</p><p dir="ltr">As Halloween will be using the 1978 movie as its blueprint, that means the setting is in the sleepy rural and suburban town of Haddonfield, Illinois. "All the decorations, the characters, the clothing are all from the 1970s," he explains. "It's been a lot of fun exploring what that means, and everything that comes with having that kind of technology back then when it comes to actually making the single-player is a big portion of this compared to our previous titles."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557923"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557923-screenshot_06.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While Haddonfield may have you just thinking of the iconic suburban neighborhood, its grounded and familiar setting being what elevates the horror when a terrifying killer is let loose in it, Matthewson also assures me that there will be a variety of maps that go beyond that neighborhood. "There's a lot more to Haddonfield that you see throughout the movie that we'll be exploring and making sure there's different types of maps that have different sizes and different types of play styles associated, so it does lend itself to different experiences as you get set on these different maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Having what sounds like large sandbox maps is going to be crucial to Halloween's more slow-paced and stealth-based gameplay. Whereas Friday the 13th boiled down to Jason trying to kill as many counselors as possible within a time limit, Halloween's Haddonfield isn't just a map but a simulation of '70s suburbia, so there will be a lot of NPCs also going about their own routines on Halloween night. The twist is that any one of these can be targets for Myers.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the Agent 47 comparison comes into play, as Myers needs to bide his time, observing an NPC, staying in the shadows, until the opportune moment to kill comes. What this means is that rather than playing as targets trying to escape, the goal of other players is to prevent the massacre from occurring by rescuing the targeted townsfolk, such as convincing them to leave their homes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png" data-ref-id="1300-4557924"></a><figcaption>Halloween</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557924-screenshot_03.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very stealthy on both sides since Michael of course doesn't want to be seen and he has a more methodical approach, but the civilians are obviously trying to stay out of sight until they have the means to try and combat him," explains Matthewson. Just as it is that assassinating a target out in the open can have everyone coming after you in Hitman, so too it seems that Michael's massacre can be more difficult to pull off if he gives himself away. It will also be possible for the civilian players to escalate things. "You can try to call the cops and convince them there's a murderer on the loose. If the cops come to investigate and start finding evidence, they'll send more and more that create a much more difficult challenge for Michael. He's very powerful, but at the same time, the authority figures will challenge him."</p><p dir="ltr">But without seeing this in action, I can't quite picture in my head how this plays out. Is the bogeyman seriously going to be deterred by a bunch of smalltown cops? If Michael Myers is such a foreboding presence, I also can't imagine his stealth options are going to involve crouching in a bush, but if not then how does he stay stealthy? And given that this game is sticking to just the 1978 movie, which was arguably his most grounded depiction, does that limit the kind of powers he will have when facing both other players as well the rest of the town?</p><p dir="ltr">Alas, those are details we'll have to wait for Illfonic to reveal at a later date. Nonetheless, Matthewson assures me that the studio has been doing a lot of research and working directly with IP holder Compass to explore what Michael is truly capable of. "It retains that grounded nature because it is meant to exist in a reality where you feel vulnerable and you feel like you're in a familiar setting," he says. "It's been really fun to explore that side of it, and making sure we stick to it but then also getting to jump back to Michael's perspective and expand on it in a way that makes it a really interesting, fun, powerful experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Halloween will be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Supermassive Games has already proven itself as one of the most popular storytellers in interactive cinematic horror--since Until Dawn's release a decade ago, more than half a dozen similar titles that focus on different monsters have been released. Directive 8020 is the latest of these as part of its anthology series The Dark Pictures, and sees the developer charting new territory in space.</p><p dir="ltr">Alien is one major cornerstone, the film that really showed us how terrifying space can be, while you also play as a crew on board the ship Casseopeia who are due to awake from cryosleep. There's even a touch of 2001: A Space Odyssey, given the presence of a talking supercomputer called Oracle, though playing through the first episode, I don't have enough reason to be suspicious. The grave threat instead is a meteorite that's breached the ship's hull, which has also brought some kind of alien fleshy matter on board that can mimic the appearance of the crew. This is essentially The Thing in space.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> New Supermassive Game Directive 8020 Pulls Inspiration From The Thing</p>
      </div>
<p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ibY6uKgpvw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ibY6uKgpvw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While that will no doubt open up to paranoia among the crew when you're going to question who is or isn't human, at this point the ship only has two monitoring crew up and about, Tomas Carter and Sims, so when the latter suddenly starts behaving murderously aggressive, it's no surprise that something's not right.</p><p dir="ltr">The formula for Supermassive's interactive horror typically involves making choices and reacting to quicktime events, with the occasionally awkward moments of actually controlling a character in third-person. But given that there are times you're going to be hunted, creative director Will Doyle explains that this has meant that Directive 8020's control systems couldn't just follow on from its past Dark Pictures titles.</p><p dir="ltr">"The way the character moves, and the way the camera works [has been] rebuilt from the ground up, and that's to support some of the stealth gameplay that we've put in," he explains. "We've got these real-time threats, who will hunt you down and kill you. So that complete overhaul is new to this game."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557919"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557919-directive8020_screenshot_simmsout.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the same time, a more traditional third-person adventure format also allows for more exploration and puzzles, as you can turn on a flashlight to navigate the creepy, dark corridors of the ship, and also have a scanner that's used for interacting with certain objects. I'm not fully convinced that these sections of gameplay will prove enjoyable--when I play a cinematic horror game, it just feels plodding to be walking around and handling very mundane interactions that any good film editor would have left on the cutting-room floor. It also doesn't help that the build I played also had some awkward moments when the prompt wouldn't come up if you were standing too close to an object--a bug the team had already warned me about in advance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nonetheless, Doyle insists that this is intentional in the game's design philosophy. "A lot of traditional action-adventure games have these design loops where you're getting ammunition, and we see story as the reward in those loops," he explains. "We have a load of stuff hidden around the world, but they're advancing the story all the time. So within our discovery sections, where you're moving around in control of your character, as well as evading threats, you're also unraveling pieces of this mystery, so the story gets driven throughout."</p><p dir="ltr">However, the new mechanic that intrigues me the most is Turning Points, which essentially breaks down every narrative decision into a story beat that you can not only chart on a menu screen but also return to. In past games, when a decision occurs or a character dies, the story continues and there's no way to undo it. While this way of playing the game still remains in Survivor mode for those who want to live and die by their decisions, I also wondered if the ability to rewind is due to there being more direct character control that can lead to potentially more frustrating mistakes, especially for a more casual audience not used to playing with a controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557920"></a><figcaption>Directive 8020</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4557920-directive8020_screenshot_cassiopeia.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doyle recalls that there have been players of the studio's past games who have actually stopped playing when a favorite character died because they couldn't be bothered with trying again. And while he admits that Turning Points alleviate this frustration, and helps make the game more approachable for a player worried about their skill level, he says the mechanic is really there to enhance the game for narrative-focused players. Meanwhile, a range of accessibility settings also allow you to effectively reduce the enemy AI to a ghost-themed train ride, where they may be scary but won't ever catch or kill you.</p><p dir="ltr">"[Turning Points are] a save system, but within each individual beat, you can go back to characters who are alive or dead based on decisions made," he explains. "If you rewind to a decision point, you can explore different paths. You can pass anywhere you've been in the story. So when you see the [narrative] tree, you can explore all the way down on the tree. We want people to play the game however they want to play."</p><p dir="ltr">So rather than a rewind mechanic like say, Max's power in Life Is Strange, it's actually better to think of Turning Points as more like a fast-travel system in a narrative game, and a more elegant way to explore different decision paths than save-scumming.</p><p dir="ltr">"You can rewind all the way back as far as you want to go, so even at the end of the game, I can jump right back to any point," Doyle adds, and it's here that the system feels like it's going to be the most beneficial for both completionists who want to comb through every secret or piece of content in the game without having to replay from start to finish. Think of it like being able to skip to any chapter of a DVD, but a lot more interactive. "For [Trophy/Achievement] hunters, there's still a challenge to seeing everything, but the Turning Points [allow] you to whizz back to where you need to get to make those changes. And that's kind of the magic of what we do."</p><p dir="ltr">Directive 8020 releases for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>

                <p>Bethesda is not finished supporting 2023's spacefaring RPG Starfield. Lead creative producer Tim Lab said in a new video that fans can look forward to many new updates to the game over time, including a second story DLC.</p><p>"I'm really excited for players to see what the team has been working on. We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story," he said. "I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights."</p><p>Starfield's first story DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-start-starfield-dlc-shattered-space/1100-6526794/" data-ref-id="1100-6526794">Shattered Space</a>, was released in September 2024.
