                <p>The life-sim game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529953/" data-ref-id="1100-6529953">InZoi</a> is coming this month, and the game's developer has finally confirmed additional key details, including the price of the game at launch.</p><p>Game director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim said during the InZoi global showcase that the game will debut on Steam in early access for $40, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzoi-will-cost-as-much-as-a-sims-4-expansion-pack-and-until-it-leaves-early-access-all-dlcs-and-updates-will-be-free/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. He said the game still has "a lot to improve on," which is part of the reason why it's launching in early access.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkXfP9rwrm8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QkXfP9rwrm8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Kjun also confirmed that InZoi will receive four free updates throughout 2025, while smaller updates will add things like new outfits and furniture--the plan is for these smaller updates to come at a pace of every three months. However, the final plan is not finalized and things could change, he said.</p><p>An update planned for May will allow players to visit a gym where they can change their character's body shape; an August update will add a "cat-themed city" for <a href="https://awareness-days.co.uk/awareness-day/international-cat-day/2025-08-08/#:~:text=August%208%2C%202025&amp;text=This%20day%20encourages%20cat%20lovers,a%20leading%20cat%20welfare%20charity." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">International Cat Day</a>. Updates will also add things like modding support, in-game cheat codes, an adoption system, the ability to swim, freelancer jobs, hotkey customization, and the ability to change the temperature of indoor environments.</p><p>InZoi is a Sims-like life sim from InZoi Studio and published by PUBG company Krafton. Like The Sims, players create, control, and observe the lives of "Zois" who are living in a simulation of the player's design.</p><p>InZoi releases in early access for PC on March 27. It's also in the works for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but a release date for those console platforms has not been announced.</p>
