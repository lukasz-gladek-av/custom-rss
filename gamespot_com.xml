                <p>It's not often that every entry in a video game trilogy is satisfying from start to finish, but in the case of Hitman: World of Assassination, that series is the very definition of perfect execution. If you haven't played it yet, all three Hitman games from IO Interactive--the developer of the upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">007: First Light</a>--are getting a new PS5 collection dubbed the <a href="https://sovrn.co/1e67m2j" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hitman: World of Assassination Anniversary Edition</a>.

Admittedly, performance on Switch 2 isn't the best--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/io-acknowledges-hitman-performance-issues-on-switch-2-promises-fixes-are-coming/1100-6533116/">but fixes are on the way</a>--and this is a Game Key Card version of the game, so you'll need to have a chunk of free space on the Switch 2 SSD to store the game on.</p><p>You'll also get exclusive--and stylish--DLC, that you can use to dress Agent 47 up like a Mario or a Luigi cosplayer on the Paris fashion circuit.</p></div>                      </div><p>So what makes Hitman so great? Following the mixed reception to Hitman: Absolution, IO Interactive went back to basics with the next chapter in the series. The soft reboot of Hitman was released in an episodic format, and it was followed by Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 in short succession. Improvements from the sequels were retroactively applied to the older games, and the entire experience plays like a toybox for assassins.</p><p>Each mission gives you a target to pursue and execute--don't worry, they're always terrible people or actor Sean Bean--and the magic here comes from figuring out how to make each assassination look like a freak accident. There are opportunities to get rid of your marks with ballistic or neck-snapping methods, but it's far more fun to use killer Yoga, sabotaged race cars, or a vegan cake to deliver some karmic justice. The Hitman games have also been supported with several pieces of substantial post-launch content over the years</p><p>With this version of the game, you're also getting more than just dozens of highly replayable levels. Several modes like Contracts, Escalation, and the roguelike Freelancer will push your skills and your lethal creativity to the limit.

                <p dir="ltr">Sometimes the difference between nailing that first-time shot or shanking it in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26 </a>comes down to what camera you’re using. With the wrong settings, working out where your support runners are or shots on goal can feel like a real pain.</p><p dir="ltr">But by carefully curating your camera settings to benefit you--and your setup--you can gain the upper hand in pretty much any game mode. So to help you win more games, we’ve been experimenting to find the best camera settings in EA Sports FC 26.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Ultimate Team</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>UT Competitive Camera:</strong> Disabled</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Single Player Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Multiplayer Camera:</strong> Co-op</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0*</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The <strong>co-op camera </strong>gives you the best view of the pitch, in our opinion. It’s a wide angle that gives you visibility on both halves, making it easier to spot player runs and target better through balls.</p><p dir="ltr">We’ve opted to max out the height of the camera to provide a more top-down view, while zoom is zeroed to give you the most visibility. However, if you’re playing on a large TV or sitting far away from your screen, you might want to increase the zoom level to make it easier to play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4572413"></a><figcaption>Personalised camera settings make all the difference in online competitive Ultimate Team games, so spend your time learning what works for you.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4572413-best-camera-settings-fc-26.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">We’ve disabled the UT Competitive Camera, which is new to the game, only because we found it too distracting. The setting is meant to give you more visibility of the pitch while still showing off the stadium and its atmosphere. However, we’re here to win games--not look at the stands.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best camera settings for Rush</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Rush Camera:</strong> Rush Tactical</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Height:</strong> 20</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Zoom:</strong> 0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It’s a similar story for Rush. We’ve changed the camera from the default broadcast to Rush Tactical to improve overall visibility and provide more of a top-down view.</p><p dir="ltr">With only 10 players on a pitch at one time, you need to make use of the space around you - and you can only do that if you can actually see where the space is.</p><p dir="ltr">So those are the best camera settings in FC 26--in our view, at least. You’ll see lots of professional players and streamers playing with different settings online, but the important thing is to play around with them yourself to find what works for you.</p>
