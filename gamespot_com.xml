                <p>Earlier this year, Pocketpair debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, and the open-world monster-taming adventure quickly became one of the breakout hits of 2024. But the year isn't over yet, and Pocketpair is already teasing Palworld's first-ever crossover collaboration in 2025, which will bring the heavily armed and adorable monsters alongside characters from the crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/terraria-review/1900-6316247/" data-ref-id="1900-6316247">Terraria</a>.</p><p>The announcement was made on Pocketpari's official Palworld account on X. Pocketpair also teased news about the next update for Palworld, which will arrive "very soon."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palworld_en/status/1861560568756462079" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...<br>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!<br>! ! ! Palworld x Terraria ! ! !<br>More info coming soon! <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@terraria_logic</a> <a href="https://t.co/nmLpkPCn2t" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/nmLpkPCn2t</a></p>  â€” Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Palworld and Teraria are very different games, with the latter embracing a throwback 2D style set in a sandbox structure that resembles Minecraft. By contrast, Palworld has a 3D landscape and gameplay elements that are very similar to Nintendo's Pokemon. We're not sure how the elements of those two games will be blended together for the collaboration. Perhaps Palworld characters can appear in Terraria and vice versa.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo's lawsuit</a> against Pocketpair doesn't seem to have slowed down the company's ambitions for Palworld. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">was ported to PlayStation 5</a> earlier this fall, even in Japan, where the company is contesting Nintendo's lawsuit. Pocketpair subsequently disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">the three patents that Nintendo claims Palworld infringed upon</a>, as well as the relatively low amount--which is roughly just under $33,000--that the latter is seeking in damages. The lawsuit seeks the same amount in damages to The Pokemon Company, as well. Meanwhile, Pocketpair and Sony have formed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">Palworld Entertainment</a> to expand the franchise and create new merchandise and licensing opportunities.</p>

                <p>If there were ever any doubt about the ever-increasing cultural footprint of the Call of Duty franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6</a> was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">October's best-selling game in the US</a>, and also the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far</a>. Now, the franchise has apparently inspired the nationally ranked University of Kentucky men's basketball team to reach new heights.</p><p>The Kentucky Wildcats are currently ranked No. 8 in the nation and undefeated at 5-0, which senior guard Koby Brea attributes to the team's Call of Duty-inspired training program, Ball of Duty. During a press conference attended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky Sports Radio</a>, Brea explained the rules of the Ball of Duty and how it was adopted by the team.</p><p>"We start to see more clips on film of how connected our team is defensively. How many kills we're getting--you know, three stops in a row," said Brea. "That's something that we take pride [in] and it's something funny that the coaches do. They call it Ball of Duty, and it's just [because] a lot of guys on the team play Call of Duty... And that's like a game within the game... Every game so far, we've been winning that battle."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oTkIUBgZGow" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a solid strategy for almost any sports team. Keeping the other side from scoring is the key to winning games. It sounds like the University of Kentucky coaches have simply put the idea of multiple defensive stops as "kills" into a concept that's been embraced by their Call of Duty-loving players. If it inspires the team to play better defense, then the coaching team has done their job.</p><p>Once the players are off the court, they can dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">the new Black Ops 6 Zombies map</a> in early December, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/become-a-gun-toting-raccoon-no-not-that-one-with-call-of-dutys-new-dlc/1100-6528074/" data-ref-id="1100-6528074">play as a gun-toting raccoon</a> in the latest DLC. Looking ahead, Microsoft has reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the franchise's future</a>, and there are also early rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sledgehammer-games-reportedly-leading-development-on-2027s-call-of-duty/1100-6528047/" data-ref-id="1100-6528047">2027's Call of Duty game</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gearbox-trying-to-show-game-early-to-terminally-ill-fan/1100-6527412/" data-ref-id="1100-6527412">a terminally ill Borderlands fan</a> named Caleb McAlpine put out what he described as a "long shot" plea to Gearbox to allow him to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">Borderlands 4</a> before he passes away. According to McAlpine, his stage-4 cancer means he may have less than two years to live. Fortunately, Gearbox has come through for McAlpine and fulfilled his wish.</p><p>In an update posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, McAlpine thanked everyone who supported his request and confirmed that Gearbox flew him and a friend out via first class to Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas. During his visit, McAlpine met the developers and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. He also shared his first impressions of Borderlands 4.</p><p>"We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far, and it was amazing," wrote McAlpine. "I don't know if I will be around when the game comes out, but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was officially announced during the opening night of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Gamescom</a> in August, but we still don't know too much about the sequel. Gearbox has shown off concept art for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">a new planet that will appear in the game</a>, while also teasing a new character who is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">"far more dangerous" than Handsome Jack</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025, but there isn't an exact release window yet. Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has indicated that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">won't release Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4 in close proximity</a> to each other. For now, we'll just have to wait for more details to emerge.</p>

                <p>After 31 years, PlayStation icon Shuhei Yoshida is retiring from Sony Entertainment Interactive. The account-executive-turned-SIE-president--who stepped down from his former position back in 2019 in order to helm the company's Independent Developer Initiative--revealed the news via an interview shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>. Yoshida's last day with the company will be January 15, 2025.</p><p>"I've been with PlayStation from the beginning," Yoshida told Sony senior communications director Sid Shuman. "When I hit 30 years, I was thinking, 'Hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.' You know, the company's been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I'm so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, 'Okay, this is my time.'"</p><p>Yoshida joined Sony in 1993 as lead account executive and one of the key members of its PlayStation project. According to Yoshida, he was also the first "non-technical" person aboard the team, and thus played a vital part in bringing the original PlayStation to market. He further elaborated on this in the blog post, stating that his role was largely reaching out to publishers and developers in Japan in hopes of them bringing their games to the PlayStation ecosystem.</p><p>"That was a really fun time, but also a really challenging time," Yoshida said. "Not many people in the industry believed in 3D graphics technology."</p><p>Yoshida has since held a number of roles throughout the company, with his most notable being SIE worldwide president. He held the position from May 2008 to November 2019.</p><p>Yet regardless of which role he held, Yoshida has always been a prominent figure in the development of several high-profile PlayStation titles. These include Gran Turismo, God of War, The Last of Us, Journey, InFamous, Ape Escape, The Legend of Dragoon, and more. Yoshida says that while he felt "fortunate" to work on "so many great games," Journey--and its big win at DICE's Game of the Year Awards--will always be particularly memorable to him.</p><p>"Journey was distributed through PlayStation Network. It was a digital-only, small game. You can finish playing the game within like three hours," Yoshida said. "But that gameâ€¦[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles.</p><p>"The creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life. The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on peopleâ€™s lives."</p><p>Yoshida will remain with Sony until January 15, 2025, after which he will enjoy a well-earned retirement. However, this will likely not be the last we see of him, as he has already indicated that <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/1861562394251825531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he intends to remain involved in the gaming industry</a>.</p>
