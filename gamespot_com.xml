                <p dir="ltr">Following its launch back in October, The Rise of the Golden Idol is set to add some additional chapters to its tale of murder and mystery in the first expansion, called The Sins of New Wells. Developer Color Gray has teased a March release window for the upcoming DLC, but it seems the actual release date might have also been slyly revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">In the style of the game, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/521956605068051135" rel="nofollow ">teaser post</a> on The Rise of the Golden Idol's Steam page had shed some slightly redacted light on what players can expect from The Sins of New Wells. The post confirms the expansion will contain four new cases, a new character named Cliff Savea, and more of the dangerous magic from the fictional world of Lemuria.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ColorGray7/status/1894388848911610281" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A new case file lands on your desk from the Police Commissioner.

While the posts reveal a few more names, scenes, and items, it seems like eagle-eyed fans may be able to sus out The Sins of New Wells's exact release date from all of the information provided.

                <p>The hints about the impending return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater after a five-year hiatus started appearing earlier this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">the release of a new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 map</a>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-site-is-counting-down-to-an-announcement/1100-6529655/" data-ref-id="1100-6529655">the official site for THPS began counting down</a> to March 4. While Activision and Tony Hawk himself are likely waiting for that day--which conspicuously happens to be 3/4-- to make their announcement, a rating has been issued for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remastered edition of two earlier games in the franchise.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-rated-in-singapore-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore <a href="https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/Classification/Search/VideoGames/SearchDetail.aspx?sTitle=IDX/2502/000036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has approved a rating</a> for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. A launch date wasn't disclosed, but the game is listed as a 2025 release.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was originally released in 2001, and it was followed by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 in 2002. This double remaster follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which was released in 2020. There haven't been any new console games in the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015. The official X account for the franchise has dropped a new teaser message that reads, "Loading... new parks 3/4/25."</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. That game changed his life, and Hawk hasn't made any secret about his desire to continue the franchise that made him a video game legend. The 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was in September 2024, and Hawk revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he had been in contact with Activision</a> about the occasion. Although no announcement was made at the time, Hawk assured THPS fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the franchise was far from over</a>.</p><p>An earlier report suggested that the next Tony Hawk game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">could launch as soon as this summer</a>, and that's definitely plausible given the timing of the announcement. We'll know more when Activision makes its official announcement on March 4.</p>

When synced wirelessly via the included USB-C dongle, the Ultimate 2 reportedly offers near-seamless input recognition with 1ms latency. The Ultimate 2 also has a polling rate of 1,000Hz when using 2.4GHz wireless or USB-C wired connections. To be clear, the original Ultimate offered a stable and fast wireless connection, but it sounds like the new model will be even better in this regard. It's also the first Ultimate Controller to use a USB-C dongle instead of USB-A. On Android, the Ultimate 2 syncs via Bluetooth.</p><p>8BitDo replaced the Hall Effect sticks found on many of its controllers with TMR sticks. Like Hall Effect sticks, TMR technology uses electromagnets to provide a smoother feel with more accurate, precise movements. Electromagnetic controls also mitigate the risk of analog stick drift. Though similar overall, TMR technology is typically viewed as an improvement compared to Hall Effect tech. The new analog sticks are accompanied by customizable RGB lighting rings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449942,1300-4449943,1300-4449944,1300-4449945,1300-4449946" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 2 is the first controller in the series to feature four extra buttons. 8BitDo essentially combined the designs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate</a> with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0DM1WH5BV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2C</a>, the manufacturer's latest budget wireless controller. It has two remappable back triggers (like the Ultimate) as well as two extra shoulder buttons (like the Ultimate 2C).</p><p>8BitDo also added another common pro-style customization feature to the Ultimate 2: trigger locks. The Hall Effect analog sticks can instantly convert to linear buttons by flicking the switches on the back.</p><p>In addition to the physical modifications, the Ultimate 2 supports 8BitDo's proprietary app on PC and Android. With Ultimate Software V2, you can create up to three profiles and make adjustments to stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivity, modify rumble intensity, and program analog stick dead zones.</p><p>Like 8BitDo's other premium controllers in its flagship series, the Ultimate 2 comes with a matching USB-C charging dock with a compartment to store the USB dongle. While it's unclear how much game time you can get from a full charge, the Ultimate 2's battery is substantially larger than the original's battery. The Ultimate 2 has a 1,000mAh battery, whereas the Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch each have 480mAh batteries. The original Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth offered 15 and 22 hours of battery life, respectively, so the new model may offer a marked improvement to those already solid figures.</p><p>The downside to the Ultimate 2 is that it's limited to PC and Android at the moment. The original Ultimate 2.4GHz Controller eventually became compatible with Apple devices, so it's possible that will happen down the line with the sequel, too. 8BitDo typically releases Nintendo Switch versions of its Ultimate Controllers, so we may get a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch</a>, which is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">best Nintendo Switch controller</a> designed by a third-party.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

                <p>Striking Distance Studios, the Krafton-owned game studio that made 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a> and 2024's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/redacted/" data-ref-id="5000-622841">Redacted</a>, has undergone a new round of layoffs. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-more-than-30-staff/1100-6516498/" data-ref-id="1100-6516498">previous round of cuts in 2023.</a></p><p>In a statement to GameSpot, Striking Distance confirmed that it has "reduced the size of its team" in an effort to "remain agile." The statement also stressed that the cuts were part of a drive to establish a "sustainable environment" at the studio for the "current stage of development on future projects."</p><p>Striking Distance does not have any upcoming games that have been announced, but the statement confirmed that the team "remains operational" and that the layoffs "will not impact any planned ongoing support."</p><p>"No further changes are planned at this time," Striking Distance said to close out its statement.</p><p>In terms of the scope of the cuts, that remains unknown, but <a href="https://80.lv/articles/the-callisto-protocol-s-striking-distance-studios-lays-off-most-of-the-developers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80 Level discovered</a> that anaffected worker said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"most of the devs were laid off."</a></p><p>Striking Distance has <a href="https://sds.com/careers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">zero open positions listed on its careers page.</a></p><p>The Callisto Protocol was released in 2022 and was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-is-no-longer-a-pubg-spin-off/1100-6503927/" data-ref-id="1100-6503927"> originally planned to be a PUBG spin-off before those plans were scuttled and it became its own thing.</a> The game wasn't a critical or commercial hit, however. Striking Distance followed it up with October 2024's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redacted-review-prison-break/1900-6418307/" data-ref-id="1900-6418307">Redacted</a>, which is set in the same sci-fi horror universe as The Callisto Protocol. It didn't exactly light it up, either, in terms of review scores or sales--it <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2229940/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">achieved a peak concurrent player figure of 168 on Steam.</a></p><p>As for what's next, it's been reported that Striking Distance is <a href="https://80.lv/articles/the-callisto-protocol-developer-is-working-on-a-new-aaa-multiplayer-game-powered-by-ue5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">working on a third-person AAA multiplayer game that runs on Unreal Engine 5.</a></p><p>Striking Distance was founded by Glen Schofield, who is best known for his work on the Dead Space and Call of Duty franchises.
