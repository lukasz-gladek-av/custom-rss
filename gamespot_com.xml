                <p>The two-decade wait for player housing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is nearly over, as Blizzard has announced housing will launch on December 2 for those who preorder the Midnight expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Housing will be launching into what Blizzard is calling "early access"--and will support weekly housing quests but won't have its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">Neighborhood event system</a> fully online. Players will, however, be able to buy a home, decorate it, design rooms, join Neighborhoods, earn decor through achievements, and craft decor items. Those who don't own Midnight won't be able to purchase a home but will still be able to acquire housing items and decor, should they later decide to upgrade to the new expansion.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1988668119611478523?s=20" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.2.7 packs a punch with...<br>🏘️ Housing early access + weekly quests<br>📖 Midnight’s Prologue Campaign<br>🚀 Revamped experiences for new + returning players <br>And much more! <a href="https://t.co/XetLDy5VDe" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/XetLDy5VDe</a></p>  — World of Warcraft (@Warcraft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1988668119611478523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While housing is the big new attraction, and one that players have waited over 20 years for, there are some other new features rounding out the 11.2.7 update. That includes a prologue questline to set up the story of Midnight, a new Lorewalking campaign centered around the origins of the Blood and Void Elves of Azeroth, and a quest chain to unlock Pandaren Heritage armor. The Timewalking event Turbulent Timeways will also make a return, and will for the first time feature dungeons from 2020's Shadowlands expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">Another major addition coming in The War Within's final patch is a revamped new- and returning-player experience. New players will journey from the Exile's Reach tutorial zone straight into the Dragonflight expansion. Returning players will be able to travel to a new experience that sees them team up with Thrall and Jaina, after which they'll be equipped in level-appropriate gear and able to jump into the rest of the game as they see fit. A "recap" version of The War Within will additionally be available to new or returning players who wish to play through an accelerated version of the expansion to get caught up with the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">The arrival of housing is a major moment for Blizzard's MMORPG, though some players do have concerns with how Blizzard is looking to monetize the highly anticipated feature. Last week, Blizzard revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-new-premium-currency-is-player-friendly-and-more-efficient-blizzard-says/1100-6536042/" data-ref-id="1100-6536042">premium currency called Hearthsteel</a> that will be used to purchase housing items on the game's shop, sparking swift outcry from concerned players. Blizzard said the introduction of Hearthsteel is intended to be player-friendly and more convenient for making smaller purchases.</p>

                <p>As part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">Valve's big hardware announcements today</a>, the company did not disclose a price for the new Steam Machine device. Hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat was asked in an interview about what Valve's position is, at a high level, regarding pricing, and Aldehayyat said the aim is to land at a "competitive price" that matches up with the value provided. This is what most companies say about their new products, and Valve is following suit. The aim, he said, is to make it "affordable."</p><p>"If you're trying to make a PC that has similar features and similar performance, I think the Steam Machine is going to be a really competitive price to that and provide really good value to it," he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-next-gen-steam-machine-and-steam-controller-the-big-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>Aldehayyat said affordability is a key concern for many today, maybe more than ever, as <a href="https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inflation ticks up</a> and concerns remain ongoing due to the impact of tariffs.</p><p>"The affordability piece you mentioned is one of the reasons why we think a Steam Machine makes a lot of sense right now. So it's just something that we thought about every time we made a hardware decision, a feature decision, is to make sure that we keep it as approachable, as affordable as possible," Aldehayyat added.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmKrKTwtukE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OmKrKTwtukE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a lot of nebulous talk, but it's as much as Valve was willing to say at this juncture. The system is set to be released in Spring 2026, with preorders presumably opening beforehand.</p><p>Valve also did not disclose the prices for the new Steam Controller and Steam Frame virtual reality headset. You can read more about the new Valve devices in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">GameSpot's extended coverage. </a></p><p>Beyond the new hardware, Valve is working on a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-deadlock-has-a-super-secret-invite-only-alpha-different-from-the-known-invite-only-alpha/1100-6531294/" data-ref-id="1100-6531294"> MOBA game called Deadlock</a>.

                <p>Less than two weeks after its official launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> now has duo matchmaking. Developer Embark Studios quietly tested the feature before fully unveiling it to players and explaining how it works.</p><p>In a post on Arc Raiders' <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/duo-and-store-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the devs noted that duo matchmaking "is not a 100% guaranteed system." Solo players and squads are prioritized to play separately, and duos are ideally paired up with other duos, while trios get to play bands of trios. However, Embark warns that "you may at times run into differing constellations of players other than your own."</p><p>Following up on feedback from fans, Embark will lower the prices on some of the cosmetic items in the store starting on November 13. Anyone who purchased items for their original price will be refunded the difference.</p><p>Embark also stated that there are no pay-to-win items in the game's premium Raider Decks. Those are being reserved for items of "cosmetics and convenience." One free Raider Deck is currently available for all players, and there will be free and premium Raider Decks in the future.</p><p>The Arc Raiders team has recently courted controversy over the game's use of AI voices. Junghun Lee, the CEO of Embark publisher Nexon, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">defended the AI voices' inclusion</a> in the game and claimed that "every game company is now using AI."</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-receiving-in-game-compensation-for-server-struggles/1100-6535907/" data-ref-id="1100-6535907">Embark sent in-game compensation</a> to Arc Raiders players over certain server issues. The game also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-has-already-broken-a-steam-concurrent-players-record-for-extraction-shooters/1100-6535848/" data-ref-id="1100-6535848">hit more than 264,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam ahead of the launch of the Arc Raiders' first major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everything-new-in-arc-raiders-north-line-update-full-details/1100-6536145/" data-ref-id="1100-6536145">North Line</a>.

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has weighed in with his thoughts on Valve's just-announced new line of gaming hardware, saying the company welcomes the new Steam Frame and Steam Machine devices.</p><p>"Gaming moves forward when players and developers have more ways to play and create, especially across open platforms. Expanding access across PC, console, and handheld devices reflects a future built on choice, core values that have guided Xbox's vision from the start," he said. "As one of the largest publishers on Steam, we welcome new options for players to access games everywhere."</p><p>Another Xbox employee, senior social marketing manager Josh Stein, said the new Steam Machine device bears a resemblance to the leaked images of the Xbox Series S, which didn't turn out to be real.</p><p>Valve's announcements include a new Steam Controller, a cube-like Steam Machine that allows people to play PC games on their TV, and a Steam Frame virtual reality headset.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Essential Starter Guide</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major changes outlined will come alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">November 18 California Resistance update</a>, which adds a new California-based map as well as an additional weapon and vehicle. Top of the list is an additional "tuning pass" for weapon dispersion and recoil buildup. Battlefield Studios notes that the dispersion changes apply to all weapons, while most weapons have also received recoil tuning.</p><p dir="ltr">"These changes make weapons feel smoother and more consistent, especially at longer ranges where we've seen players engage more often," Battlefield Studios states.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside recoil updates, aim assist is also seeing changes that will make it feel more similar to the game's open beta. That should make aim assist "feel smoother and more predictable," according to Battlefield Studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Another point of feedback being addressed with the update is soldier visibility. Players have complained about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/" data-ref-id="1100-6535525">Battlefield 6's oppressive sunlight</a> and how transitioning from indoor and outdoor spaces can make it challenging to see. The November 18 will make improvements to lighting to help enemies be more visible in varying light conditions. Challenges will additionally have their descriptions "refined" to be more clear and make progress easier to understand.</p><p dir="ltr">Next, in the December 9 update, Battlefield Studios will be making adjustments to Breakthrough and Rush on certain maps, as well as vehicle-balance changes. On Breakthrough, several maps, including the first sector of Mirak Valley, will be adjusted to help attackers make easier progress. For Rush, MCOM placements on Manhattan Bridge and Liberation peak will be adjusted.</p><p dir="ltr">That's what Battlefield Studios is working on in the weeks ahead, but looking even further out, the post lists other potential changes that are on the studio's radar and are currently being investigated. Those include further challenge adjustments, UI and menu improvements, updates to hit registration, vehicle balance, and, of course, map design.</p><p dir="ltr">The smaller size of many of Battlefield 6's maps has been a point of contention for many players. Battlefield Studios states that it is "committed to a variety of map types across future seasons" and will be looking to learn from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-are-making-larger-maps-because-the-game-doesnt-have-them-yet/1100-6536010/" data-ref-id="1100-6536010">community-made maps in the game's Portal mode</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-battlefield-redsec-with-or-without-battlefield-6/1100-6535767/" data-ref-id="1100-6535767">Battlefield Redsec</a>, the game's free-to-play battle royale mode that launched alongside Season 1, there are a few tweaks on the team's radar for the future. Those include a solo queue, a review of the game's armor-plating mechanic, the availability of tanks, and audio improvements to make hearing vehicles and footsteps more consistent.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 launched strongly, with one analyst estimating the game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">sold 10 million copies</a>. The most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-and-redsec-1-1-1-5-update-will-patch-out-an-infamous-exploit/1100-6536103/" data-ref-id="1100-6536103">Battlefield 6 update patched out the game's most infamous exploit</a>. Meanwhile, sales from a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-12-veterans-day-pack-for-battlefield-6-but-proceeds-wont-be-donated/1100-6536113/" data-ref-id="1100-6536113">Veteran's Day Battlefield 6 DLC pack won't be donated</a>, with EA instead making a separate donation to the National Ranger Association.</p>

                <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment and French developer Oh BiBi have announced Ratchet &amp; Clank: Ranger Rumble, a free-to-play multiplayer arena shooter coming to iOS and Android. Fans can now pre-register for the game through <a href="https://www.rangerrumble.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official website</a>. It's been four years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-a-riveting-adventure/1900-6417686/" data-ref-id="1900-6417686">the last Ratchet and Clank game</a>, and this takes the duo into the mobile gaming space for the first time in years, offering a new way for players to experience its well-known humor and action.</p><p>Ranger Rumble brings back familiar characters from the Ratchet &amp; Clank universe in a fast-paced, real-time multiplayer format. Players can choose to fight solo or team up with others in exciting online matches. Each hero comes with unique abilities and access to a variety of powerful, over-the-top weapons. The game aims to capture the fun and energy of the series while introducing gameplay designed specifically for mobile devices.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlblXRS14Mg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AlblXRS14Mg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This release aligns with PlayStation's broader strategy to expand its presence in the mobile market. In 2021, former PlayStation president Jim Ryan mentioned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-mobile-games-might-be-coming-sony-exec-says/1100-6491989/" data-ref-id="1100-6491989">that mobile gaming was one of the company's key growth areas</a>, noting that PlayStation planned to bring some of its most popular franchises to mobile platforms.</p><p>It's unclear how Ranger Rumble will fit into the overall Ratchet &amp; Clank narrative, if at all. The last entry in the franchise, 2021's Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, was one of the best-received games in the series, but was also a standalone story.</p>
