                <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> would release on September 4 was such a surprise that even the most tuned-in Hollow Knight fans were in shock at the news. And now, just days before Silksong releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is seeing a renaissance with gamers, passing its Steam concurrents records over and over again, hitting a new peak of 56,192 players on August 29, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>For years, Hollow Knight's biggest day was in May of 2022 when the game had over 20,000 concurrent players. Since the announcement of Silksong's impending release date, though, each consecutive day has seen that concurrent peak rising, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">hit 21,000 on August 22</a>, just a day after the announcement, and hit 56,192 today. For a seven-year-old indie game, this is pretty big.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that SteamDB is not the be-all-end-all of game stats. Steam is a dominant platform for sure, but Hollow Knight is available on all last and current-generation consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch being a particularly popular platform for the game. Even so, it's indicative that the legend of Hollow Knight continues to grow.</p><p>We got a sneak peek last week, and signs are looking good. "Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p>

                <p>According to EA, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> play test is the <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1958544684134912042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest beta in Battlefield's history in terms of players</a>. Research firm Oppenheimer estimated that the beta <a href="https://www.ainvest.com/news/oppenheimer-raises-battlefield-6-open-beta-player-estimate-20m-2508/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached more than 20 million people</a>. However, a "substantial number" of those fans may have been playing Battlefield 6 with the minimum recommended specs.</p><p>Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl made that assertion during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-dev-says-a-significant-number-of-users-played-the-game-below-the-minimum-recommended-specs-as-ea-points-to-the-importance-of-weaker-hardware" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. Buhl also noted that EA and DICE planned from the beginning to ensure that players using lower-end hardware would still receive a comparable experience to those on high-end machines.</p><p>"Min spec is certainly one of our most important specs ... it's super important from both a commercial and business perspective," said Buhl. "We want as many people as possible playing the game ... We did a lot of analysis, we did tests on the game on a wide range of hardware above and below our minimum and recommended specs. We figured out what we can hit, what we need to hit from a business perspective, and that was to capture a wide audience on PC. It's been super critical."</p><p>In the same interview, Buhl addressed the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-wishes-secure-boot-wasnt-needed-i-wish-everyone-could-play/1100-6534357/" data-ref-id="1100-6534357">unpopular secure boot requirement</a>, which he says is critical to fighting cheaters.</p><p dir="ltr">"The fact is I wish we didn't have to do things like Secure Boot," said Buhl. "It does prevent some players from playing the game. Some people's PCs can't handle it and they can't play: that really sucks. I wish everyone could play the game with low friction and not have to do these sorts of things ... Unfortunately these are some of the strongest tools in our toolbox to stop cheating."</p><p dir="ltr">EA has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-pc-specs-revealed-and-you-wont-need-a-military-grade-pc-to-run-it/1100-6533619/" data-ref-id="1100-6533619">the PC specs for Battlefield 6</a>, as well as some upcoming changes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-devs-address-open-beta-feedback-double-down-on-changes-to-rush/1100-6534180/" data-ref-id="1100-6534180">based on player feedback from the beta</a>. Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
