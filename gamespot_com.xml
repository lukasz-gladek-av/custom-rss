                <p dir="ltr">Collaborative challenges aren't a brand-new concept for Games Done Quick--the twice-yearly speedrunning charity event--but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsdhHhCdi3VljAB_8cVnjPg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KingJO444</a> took things just a little bit further for Awesome Games Done Quick 2026. On January 10 in Pittsburgh, he gathered a group of 70 players together to attempt an absurdly chaotic challenge: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/watch-this-ridiculous-70-person-super-mario-64-relay/1100-6537329/">Collect 70 stars in Super Mario 64</a> with 70 different players. Somehow, he and the community were successful, completing the challenge in under two hours.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't an easy feat to come up with an estimated time for the run, at all, because of the 70 people who participated--each getting exactly one star before passing off the controller--only between 15-20 had any serious experience running the game. Of the remaining players, some had not played Super Mario 64 since childhood, and others had never played the game at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"You never know how much someone's going to practice, or what's going to happen on stage," KingJ told us in a post-run interview. He set the estimated time to complete the run at an hour and 40 minutes, but this was only slightly longer than the current world record. </p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that gave enough of a buffer, but also, I kind of underestimated how many people were going to go in for their first time ever playing the game," KingJ added. "And not only that, but we also had blindfolded runners, which added on top of that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-VFPEh59k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r-VFPEh59k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That meant a whole lot of training throughout the week leading up to the run. Several of the more experienced runners worked with the newcomers, ensuring they could get the star they were assigned. One was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ad129/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ad129</a>, who was also very familiar with the game and supported KingJ since early in the planning phase.</p><p dir="ltr">"We spent most of the time in the practice room just having a [game] setup, if not multiple setups, and people would come on by and just do their star--either practicing or just verifying that they could do it. It was very awesome to see someone coming in with no experience in the game and we teach them the star," they added.</p><p dir="ltr">And for the most part, things went off without much of a hitch during the run. Some stars were easier than others (a few literally just talked to Toad to get a few freebies) but the pace at which the speedrunners swapped in and out of their positions and kept things moving was extremely impressive. At one point, too many failures on a certain challenge would have meant game over, but KingJ brought several Nintendo 64 consoles as redundancy options in case of an emergency, swapping to another nearly identical save file on another system in order to keep the run moving.</p><p dir="ltr">It'll be at least 18 months before GDQ is ready for a run of this magnitude again, KingJ said, but his next collaborative speedrunning attempt will likely be a bit smaller.</p><p dir="ltr">"Maybe not 70 people," he said with a laugh. "But something like Mario Kart would be a very fun one. Or something along those lines. I want to keep it mainstream, that a lot of people know, so typically Mario is a very basic one that we can do."</p><p>Whatever the future holds, the speedrunning community's certainly been successful in raising money for good causes. It raised more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/speedrun-charity-awesome-games-done-quick-2026-raised-over-2-4-million-for-cancer-research/1100-6537336/">$2.4 million for the Prevent Cancer Foundation</a> during this year's AGDQ in Pittsburgh, and Summer Games Done Quick will raise money this July in Minneapolis for Doctors Without Borders.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts has never been a particularly popular company in the eyes of consumers, but Hazelight Studios founder Josef Fares, who collaborated on three titles with the publisher, was willing to go up to bat for it during a recent interview.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/split-fictions-josef-fares-i-would" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, the Split Fiction director said that there are "a lot of great people at EA" who "respect" Hazelight's work and "leave [them] be." Then, in classic Josef Fares fashion, he argued that "there’s not a publisher in the world that hasn’t f****d up now and then."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Can EA Save Its Reputation?</p>
      </div>
<p>While EA has an infamous reputation, "earning" the title<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-exec-responds-to-worst-company-in-america-contr/1100-6443178/" data-ref-id="1100-6443178"> of "Worst Company in America"</a> from the website Consumerist in 2012 and 2013, Fares still believed that "EA is getting more sh*t than they deserve."</p><p>The list of reasons for video game players to roast EA is long enough to warrant its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Electronic_Arts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">own Wikipedia page</a>. Fans of studios like BioWare and franchises like Titanfall and Battlefield have raised grievances over EA's management of them. In the past year, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">reportedly cancelled anticipated titles</a> and underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">mass layoffs</a>. EA is far from the only big gaming company that engages in such business practices, though.</p><p>"I mean, come on, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony, everybody’s done something that’s not good," Fares continued. "But for some reason, EA has become this bad guy."</p><p>Fares emphasized Hazelight's "great relationship" with EA, while acknowledging that the company has made "mistakes like every other publisher." And it's been a lucrative relationship for Hazelight as well, with Split Fiction <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-sales-are-nearly-double-what-ea-expected-so-far/1100-6531353/" data-ref-id="1100-6531353">vastly exceeding EA's sales projections</a> when it launched last year.</p><p>As valid as Fares's points may be, EA's reputation will certainly be tested going forward, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">company's proposed sale</a> to a consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund sparking concerns that new ownership will lead to shifts in the company's culture and content.</p>

                <p>God of War composer Bear McCreary has said he would consider returning to the series, following his previous comments about how his work on the Sony series was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1jyxlmw/god_of_war_composer_says_his_work_on_the_series/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"complete."</a></p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-composer-says-he-would-be-open-to-revisiting-the-franchise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> asked McCreary if he might be interested in returning, and he replied, "If there were an opportunity to expand upon it, I would be open to that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzcqvPneP0k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qzcqvPneP0k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-casting-now-underway-as-high-profile-director-comes-aboard/1100-6536621/" data-ref-id="1100-6536621">new God of War TV show in the works for Prime Video</a>, while the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-spin-off-pushed-back-to-2026m-according-to-insiders/1100-6532551/" data-ref-id="1100-6532551">God of War game series is expected to continue</a>, so there could indeed be an opportunity for McCreary to work more in the franchise, if he was asked back.</p><p>Whatever the case, the composer said he's proud of the music he's written for the God of War games, adding that the games are "so expansive" and enjoyed by fans.</p><p>Beyond the God of War series, McCreary said he is "always looking for interesting projects" and "interesting people" to collaborate with. He specifically said he's "very interested" in working on an independent or AA game. "I think there's a lot of experimentation that happens there. And I love the medium. I'm putting it out there," he said.</p><p>The composer, 46, has been <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/bear-mccreary/51964" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">nominated for three Grammy awards</a> and is also known for his work on the TV shows Outlander, The Walking Dead, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, and Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, among others.

This edition includes all 26 episodes with English audio, the original Japanese audio with subtitles, hours of bonus features, and two films. The first Evangelion film, Death (True), is essentially a clip show that recaps the series, and The End of Evangelion is a retelling of the final two episodes.</p><p>Anyone who's familiar with the series will want to check out the four Rebuild of Evangelion movies. Released in four parts from 2007 to 2021, the project began as an almost shot-for-shot remake of the early episodes before introducing major changes to the established story, introducing new plotlines and characters.

                <p>Tom Clancy's<em> The Division</em> is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">The Division 2</a> players are the ones who are getting a gift. An update coming this March will add a Realism Mode to The Division 2, giving fans a new way to experience the game.</p><p>Realism Mode is only available for players who purchased the Warlords of New York expansion. The mode itself is a stripped down version of the game that drops or modifies some of the series' traditional elements, like the HUD, the map, and hitmarkers, as well as XP and leveling progression. Instead, players will have to adjust to a completely rebalanced arsenal and a reality where shooting a foe in an arm or a leg isn't very effective anymore. But headshots still work, which is good news considering that ammo will be much harder to find in this mode.</p><p>In the announcement video above, the Ubisoft team revealed that the upcoming anniversary season will feature a collaboration with another Tom Clancy creation, but further details about that particular collaboration weren't shared. However, it sounds like outfits and gear from Splinter Cell, Rainbow Six Siege, and Ghost Recon will be added to the game.</p><p>Following the anniversary season, Ubisoft has plans to add even more content to The Division 2. But according to the video, the publisher won't share those details until March.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-definitive-edition-spotted-in-the-wild/1100-6537325/" data-ref-id="1100-6537325">a definitive edition of The Division</a> was spotted in Japan, but it's unclear when or if Ubisoft will announce that project. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">The Division 3</a> remains in development and franchise executive producer Julian Gerighty recently said, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/" data-ref-id="1100-6535549">It’s shaping up to be a monster</a>."</p>

                <p>Those discontent with their current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> housing neighborhood may soon have another option at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those participating in WoW's recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-finally-arrives-december-2-after-decades-of-waiting/1100-6536160/" data-ref-id="1100-6536160">player housing feature</a> have two options when it comes to joining a neighborhood. The first is to join a public neighborhood that is open to anyone, while the second is to be a member of a guild and join a neighborhood that only fellow guild members can live in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nhshcr68CJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Nhshcr68CJ0?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Soon, however, it looks like there will be a third option to choose from. The ability to create invite-only charter neighborhoods recently appeared for testing on the beta for WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. The feature doesn't appear to be fully functioning just yet, but there is an option for naming and purchasing a charter neighborhood, implying that the feature is indeed on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">This charter option lets the owner invite whoever they want to the neighborhood, including players from an opposite faction, allowing Horde and Alliance players to live side-by-side. This option also allows for players from different servers or guilds, as is the case with public neighborhoods.</p><p dir="ltr">Exactly how much it might cost to create a charter neighborhood is still unknown, but if it's relatively cheap, it could have some side effects. If players are easily able to create their own private neighborhoods, more public neighborhoods could start to become abandoned. However, players can easily pick up their house and move it to a new, more populated neighborhood with little effort.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether character neighborhoods will go live with WoW's Midnight pre-patch on January 20 or with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">expansion proper on March 2</a> (or sometime later) is still unclear. However, players have already wasted little time coming up with all kinds of awe-inspiring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-creations-so-far/2900-7370/" data-ref-id="2900-7370">player housing creations</a>, so giving one person or a small group the keys to an entire neighborhood could create some even more impressive results.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what is definitely coming in the Midnight pre-patch, the update will introduce class talent tree changes, a new Demon Hunter specialization, major user interface updates, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pricey-wow-transmog-changes-have-players-angry-and-confused/1100-6536391/" data-ref-id="1100-6536391">overhaul of WoW's transmog system</a>, and a controversial new policy towards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">player-made add-ons</a> that will see many related to combat no longer function.</p>
