                <p>Two prominent video game industry veterans have voiced their opinions on AI, with both people--Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield--declaring that AI should not be feared but embraced.</p><p>Kojima, for his part, said AI is already used in a lot of creative work to "come up with ideas." But Kojima himself sees AI "as more of a friend." Kojima said he would use AI to "boost efficiency" but that he himself would continue to "lead the creative part" of game development.</p><p>"I'd like AI to handle the tedious tasks that would lower cost and cut down on time. It's more like co-creating with AI instead of just using it," he told <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/?igsh=MWp2Y25jcHV1djZvMA%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired.</a> "I see a future where I stay one step ahead; creating together with AI."</p><p>Another game developer who talked about AI recently was Schofield, the Dead Space co-creator and Call of Duty veteran. He said at Gamescom Asia this week that he's been tinkering around with generative AI for two years and maintains that it can help "fix" the games industry's issues.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us: It's here to make us better, faster, and more efficient," he said, as reported by <a href="https://x.com/andy_vgc/status/1978676771496063399?s=46&amp;t=KA0eXy1Spm71dnMQdFC23A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "It's a tool."</p><p>Before this, Schofield talked about how "everybody's spouting out about AI" but he's actually doing work with it. "We're always trying to make it cheaper, more efficient, faster, and better," he told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-and-dead-space-creator" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>.</p><p>Regarding fears of job losses, Schofield said he's old enough to remember when people thought the emergence of Photoshop and motion-capture technologies would "take jobs away." However, what Schofield said he's observed over the years is that new technologies create more jobs overall.</p><p>Schofield also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">holds the belief</a> that the massive investments into AI companies and technologies could lead to a bubble, and when it bursts, "a lot of smaller AI companies will disappear," but the "strongest systems will remain." This is not unlike the dot-com bubble, when many internet companies scaled back or went out of business, but those left standing thrived and helped shape the internet of today.</p><p>"I don't buy into the idea that AI will permanently take jobs away. Disruption in the short term? Yes. It hurts. But history shows us that every major technological leap creates whole new industries, opportunities, and specialists," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_a-discussion-on-games-ai-is-everywhere-right-activity-7367994127319298049-X879/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said in a LinkedIn post</a>. "When cell phones appeared, people worried about operators and pay phones. Instead, we ended up with billions of devices, new apps, streaming, and millions of jobs that didn't exist before. The internet, the PC, even the automobile all followed the same pattern."</p><p>The video game industry has undergone mass layoffs recently, with numerous companies slashing jobs.</p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p>

                <p>Veteran video game developer Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at the age of 58. Famous for his work on the Dead or Alive fighting game franchise and the revival of Ninja Gaiden in the 2000s, Itagaki's death was confirmed on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tomonobu.itagaki/posts/pfbid02kPXD7uXWaU3ZrRTXB1x2kYPH9SXjakibwS2poX8QU6oPXC7w5occ4GuidXECSUpZl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook profile</a> where he left a final message.</p><p>"Final Words, the flame of my life is about to go out. The fact that this message has been posted means that my time has finally come. I am no longer in this world--I have entrusted someone important to me with this final message," Itagaki's post read (via Facebook translation).</p><p>"My life was a continuous battle which I kept winning. I caused a lot of trouble for others too. I take pride in having fought to the end, and having followed my convictions. I have no regrets, but I am deeply sorry that I could not deliver new works to my fans. I'm sorry. So it goes."</p><p>Itagaki's video game career kicked off in 1992 with Tecmo Super Bowl where he served as a graphics programmer, and in 1996, he rose to fame with the release of Dead or Alive. In 2001, he was placed in charge of Team Ninja--the studio that he founded originally as Tecmo Creative #3 in the '90s--and he led the production on the modern-day revival of Ninja Gaiden. Itagaki also served as both producer and director on multiple games like Dead or Alive Ultimate, Dead or Alive 4, and Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p>By then, Itagaki had become infamous for not holding back his comments on the state of the video game industry at the time, and he later resigned from Tecmo amidst claims of the company withholding a bonus that he had been promised. He'd later found Valhalla Game Studios and release Devil's Third for the Wii U and PC, but the game was met with negative reviews upon release.</p><p>After leaving Valhalla in 2017, Itagaki returned to video game development with a new studio in 2021, Itagaki Games. Tributes have begun pouring in for the legendary developer from across the industry, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/milkman.bsky.social/post/3m3c3gq5q7c2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and James Mielke</a>--co-founder of Tigertron and BitSummit--was one of the first to talk about the loss of Itagaki. "RIP, senpai. You will always be a ninja," Mielke wrote.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are deeply saddened by the passing of Team NINJA's first leader, Tomonobu Itagaki.<br>We will carry on the philosophy and creativity that Itagaki-san began and continue to create games that many gamers will enjoy. <br>Our deepest condolences for his loss.<br>From everyone at Team…</p>  — Team NINJA (@TeamNINJAStudio) <a href="https://twitter.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/1978756897231798606?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1978728626838294647" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No way, Itagaki-san<br>you said, “Let’s grab a drink sometime,” didn’t you?<br>I don’t believe it.
