                <p>A new report claims that Naughty Dog recently mandated that workers return to the office five days per week--up from three--and had been pushing staff to work "long hours" to get a demo of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> ready to show off to Sony higher-ups.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjA4NTY0MSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjkwNDQxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0hDRFNLR0lGUEUwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.jGluGdyZVa1EEBKJKLlY2aRo0tCwewmOk2TBd_9y2Iw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg report</a> said that beginning in late October, Naughty Dog asked staff to work "a minimum of eight extra hours a week" and document their overtime in a spreadsheet. "This overtime period was an attempt to get the production back on track after several missed deadlines," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Workers were told to not work more than 60 hours per week, the report said. The return-to-office mandate was disruptive to some workers who reportedly had to find cover for childcare and their pets. The report added that the "mandated overtime" period wrapped up this week with the completion of the demo.</p><p>Sony and Naughty Dog declined to comment when approached by Bloomberg.</p><p>The report added that Naughty Dog established a new team of producers in 2021 with the directive of helping cut back on instances of extended overtime, or crunch. "Many" of these people have since left the company, the report said.</p><p>Finally, the report said Naughty Dog is aiming to release Intergalactic in mid-2027, and that workers are fearful that "overtime requirements will get worse" as the game's release draws closer.</p><p>On the topic of developers at Naughty Dog crunching, studio head Neil Druckmann said in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-2-director-on-crunch-theyre-gonna-w/1100-6478208/" data-ref-id="1100-6478208">June 2020 interview</a> with GQ, "They're gonna work very hard. We need to put some guardrails [in] so they don't injure themselves, but I don't think we could prevent them from working hard and still make the kind of games we make."</p><p>Naughty Dog co-president Evan Wells said in 2021 that its workers want to work more than 40 hours per week. Keeping people in the office only 40 hours a week "would frustrate people to no end," he said, adding that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-execs-push-back-against-unions-say-they-may-not-solve-crunch/1100-6495708/" data-ref-id="1100-6495708">unionization won't help.</a></p><p>Intergalactic is a new IP from Naughty Dog, which is notable given the company has mostly worked on sequels to its Uncharted and The Last of Us series for the past two decades. The sci-fi game aims to be Naughty Dog's "wildest, most creative story yet," and focuses on the character Jordan A. Mun, a bounty hunter who becomes stranded on a planet called Sempiria.</p><p>Naughty Dog has multiple internal development teams, and a second team could be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-collabs-cosmetics-gameplay-changes-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-7362/" data-ref-id="2900-7362">Winterfest celebration</a> kicked off with the usual array of map and gameplay changes in Battle Royale and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-winterfest-2025-all-free-cosmetics-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-7363/" data-ref-id="2900-7363">piles of free stuff in the Winterfest cabin</a>. But that's not all there is to care about in Fortnite's latest update--we've also got a pair of new sets of quests that reward XP, and an additional free cosmetic that must be earned by completing a specific one of those new quests. Let's take a look at what we've got here.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Drop_1">Drop 1</a><ul><li><a href="#Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Winterfest_2025_quests">Winterfest 2025 quests</h2><p>The first of these new quests sets, listed under Winterfest in your quest log, are for Battle Royale. There are four time-gated groups of this set of quests--the first group is available now, and the rest will be added every two days until they're all there. Completing a quest awards 12K XP each, and there may be a reward at the end of the questline--but we don't know for sure yet. These quests expire when Winterfest ends on January 5.</p><h3 id="Drop_1">Drop 1</h3><h4 id="Collect_a_Perfect_Gift_from_a_chest">Collect a Perfect Gift from a chest</h4><p>Every chest you open during Winterfest has a change to drop an item called Perfect Gift, which triggers a quest to deliver it to any non-hostile NPC on the map within five minutes. But for this quest, you just have to collect the item. Fortunately, the Perfect Gift does not require one of your inventory slots.</p><h4 id="Bring_a_Perfect_Gift_to_any_character">Bring a Perfect Gift to any character</h4><p>This quest requires you deliver one of these Perfect Gifts to an NPC. They all work, so pick whichever is most convenient.</p><h4 id="Damage_Yule_Trooper_or_any_other_boss__500_points_">Damage Yule Trooper or any other boss (500 points)</h4><p>You will need to cause 500 points of damage to any boss NPC for this one--and we mean the NPCs specifically. Players who have used a boss token to disguise themselves as bosses don't count for this.</p><h2 id="Squad_Up__quests">Squad Up! quests</h2><p>In addition to the main Winterfest quests, there's an additional set of very simple quests that simply require you to find Shiny Llamas in the Squads version of Battle Royale, Reload, OG, or Blitz. These Shiny Llamas have a random chance to drop any time you open a rare chest or supply drop, or when you defeat an enemy player or NPC. You'll receive 12K XP for every 100 of them that you collect, until you've collected 1,000 of them. You won't have to compete with your teammates for them, though, because any Shiny Llamas collected by any squad member counts for all four of you.</p><p>Which is good, because there's also a cosmetic reward for these quests. Collecting 400 of these Shiny Llamas will earn you the <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=11838" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbrite Slasher pickaxe</a>, which has been sitting in the Fortnite game files collecting dust for nearly two years. You'll want to pay particular attention to this quest if you purchased the Lego starter pack that includes the Brite Agent skin, since this is the first time it's been possible to get the pickaxe that belongs to her set.</p>

                <p>Dispatch feels like the kind of game that must have always been headed for success, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-may-get-season-2-thanks-to-super-response-from-players/1100-6536110/" data-ref-id="1100-6536110">sold a million copies in just 10 days</a>, and while it missed most of the awards season, it still landed on several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">best-of lists for the year.</a> That impression hides a much rougher reality. Dispatch took years longer than expected, nearly collapsed more than once, and only made it out because the team managed to survive long enough to finish it.</p><p>"We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit," writer and co-founder Pierre Shorette says in an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, explaining why Dispatch Season 1 took so long to make. The episodic superhero workplace comedy spent close to seven years in development. The time spent wasn't about endlessly refining a hit, but about dealing with lost funding, shifting plans, and simple survival. The upside is that the groundwork is now done, meaning a potential Season 2 would not need anything close to the same amount of time.</p><p>Game director Nick Herman is blunt about how close Dispatch came to ending. "We had a publisher who dropped us halfway through because of … financial things," he says. Shorette places that moment in the context of the wider industry collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBXNczRvheI" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vBXNczRvheI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The industry was collapsing … We were right there," he said, adding that without contract work paying the bills, "we would have died three years ago." For years, the project mostly met rejection. “You have basically everyone tell you it's a bad idea for seven f---ing years," Shorette added, while Herman recalls being told, "This is dumb, don't do it."</p><p>Dispatch was also not always the game players recognize now. It began life as a live-action interactive TV project before COVID shut that version down. Early drafts were darker and more limited, focused on a single hero rather than a full team. Over time, the game evolved into a lighter and broader experience, shifting toward the dispatch system and the group of misfit superheroes that define it today. Even Robert, the main protagonist, wasn't voiced by Aaron Paul--actor Rahul Kohli was in line to take the role. For his part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saros/">Kohli stars in Saros</a>, which is scheduled to launch next April.</p><p>Now that Dispatch is out and doing well, the pressure has changed as Shorette compares it to a musician following up a debut album. "You have your whole life to write your first album and eight months to write your second." But after taking an absurdly long time to launch one season, Dispatch is no longer starting from nothing--and that makes a much faster follow-up possible.</p><p>Dispatch is out now on PS5 and PC. It launches January 28 for Switch and Switch 2.</p>

                <p>It has been a big week for Larian Studios, which just announced its upcoming RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> to tons of fervor. Unfortunately, a lot of the week since the announcement has consisted of members of the studio, including its CEO Swen Vincke, fighting online about the team's current attitude towards AI tools in games development following an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>.</p><p>Now, after a week of backlash, Larian is hoping to clear some of the air around Divinity and its use of AI. In a statement shared on Twitter, Vincke writes, "It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">It’s been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation.<br>Larian’s DNA is agency.

(@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Vincke continues, "Larian's DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possible make."</p><p>To that end, Vincke states that it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies," but also claims that any aspect of the team's evolving processes that fails to "align with who we are" can and will be changed.</p><p>To clarify matters even more, and likely to take a bit of heat of off Vincke himself, Larian will be holding an AMA after the holidays. Representative of other departments at the studio will be present to field questions "about Divinity and our dev process directly." A date has yet to be announced, but will be shared in the new year.</p><p>In case you might've missed it, Vincke shared that Larian was openly embracing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">using generative AI tools</a> for its development processes on Divinity. Though he stated that no AI work would be in thh game itself ("Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," Vincke told Bloomberg), Larian devs are, per his comments, using AI to insert placeholder text and generate concept art for the heavily anticipated RPG.</p><p>In response to the news that generative AI is being used on Divinity, Larian has come under fire from fans and other developers online. In response to the backlash, Vincke initially stated, "Holy f**k guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI," and shared that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking.</p><p>Vincke, and Larian's, position on AI is hardly a surprise. Earlier this year, similar comments were made in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">interview with GameSpot</a> where Vincke claimed that the studio was using machine-learning tools to automate "tasks nobody wants to do."</p>

                <p>The new Apple AirPods Pro 3 launched earlier this year, but the wireless earbuds are already seeing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a limited-time price cut at Amazon</a>, where you can snag a pair for $199. That's 20% off its normal $249 price tag and one of the lowest prices we've seen so far. The AirPods Pro 3 build upon the premium sound quality and feature set of previous models, offering better active noise cancelation (ANC), a longer battery life, and new functionality like auto-translation. If you're looking for a last-minute holiday gift or are looking to treat yourself to an upgrade, this is a great opportunity to pick them up.</p><div title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5295" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6537080 -- Apple AirPods Pro 3" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Apple AirPods Pro 3</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$199 (was $249)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>As mentioned above, the AirPods 3 sport several upgrades over the previous models, including improved ANC. While the previous AirPods Pro 2 offered impressive ANC, Apple claims the AirPods Pro 3 ANC is twice as good and better at blocking a wider range of background noise. This means you can easily listen to your favorite music or podcasts without the audio being interrupted by noise from airplane cabins, traffic, or other low-frequency sounds.</p><p>The other notable AirPods Pro 3 feature is real-time speech translation powered by Apple Intelligence, which works <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apple-airpods-pro-3-offer-auto-translator-feature-similar-to-mass-effect/1100-6534619/">similar to Mass Effect's auto-translator tech</a>. The current list of supported languages includes English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. Support for Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese languages is coming soon.</p><p>Other upgrades include an improved soundscape that makes audio sound richer and clearer, built-in heart rate sensors that can track how many calories you burn across dozens of exercises, and seamless connectivity with other iOS devices. The earbuds are also lightweight and come with five pairs of silicone ear tips. Battery life lasts up to eight hours on a full charge with ANC activated, and they come with a charging case that quickly recharges the battery.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you don't need super high-quality earbuds, you can get a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJ7HYG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple AirPods 4 for $100</a>. This still offers great audio for its price, a comfortable in-ear fit, and several neat features. They have a powerful H2 chipset, which enables improved sound quality, auto-noise cancellation, and spatial sound.</p><p>For a more traditional option, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FGYDGJ3H,B0CN9GXC2R,B0F2LCBKVN,B0D4Z9C562,B0D4Z9C562,B0DZHR44J9,B0CCZC9J1V&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Bose QuietComfort headset </a>is on sale for $199 (was $359), a savings of almost 50%.
