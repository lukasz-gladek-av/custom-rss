                <p>If you've held out on buying Rock Band 4 digitally in the past decade, you have less than a week to nab it. The multiplayer party rhythm game from Harmonix will be removed from the PlayStation and Xbox stores this coming Sunday, October 5, almost 10 years to the day after its release.</p><p>Harmonix producer Kyle Wynn shared news of the impending delisting on the official Rock Band Discord server, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1973380538250518687/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> on X. According to Wynn, "the original licenses for the core soundtrack are expiring," though anyone who owns the game digitally can still access and install it.</p><p>Wynn also added that DLC songs will follow suit, being delisted once they reach 10 years of digital shelf life; again, anyone who has purchased DLC songs will still retain them in their libraries. Rock Band 4's base game includes 65 songs, and DLC support, which included the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rock-band-4-expansion-rivals-out-now-alongside-new/1100-6444551/" data-ref-id="1100-6444551">Rivals expansion</a>, lasted until January 2024.</p><p>"If you’ve been meaning to grab a few last songs, now’s the time," Wynn said at the end of the announcement.</p><p>The expiration of music licenses is often the primary reason an older game is delisted, and it should come as no surprise that most of Harmonix's catalog of classic rhythm games has been unavailable on digital storefronts for some time.</p><p>For instance, Rock Band 3 was delisted in October 2015, five years after its launch. Of course, physical copies of these games are still playable and can be found on secondary markets.</p><p>Harmonix has been under the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-getting-musical-journeys-and-gameplay-with-epics-acquisition-of-rock-band-studio-harmonix/1100-6498299/" data-ref-id="1100-6498299">ownership of Epic Games since 2021</a>, leading development of the Rock Band-like Fortnite Festival game mode. Fortnite Festival features a rotating set list, its own music pass, and headlining artists, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-gorillaz-season-in-fortnite-festival/1100-6534219/" data-ref-id="1100-6534219">most recently Gorillaz</a>.</p>
