                <p>For a game that's been in development since 2012, it was a surprise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov/" data-ref-id="5000-673440">Escape from Tarkov</a> finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/" data-ref-id="1100-6534196">emerged from early access</a> in November. And now that it's possible to really escape from Tarkov, someone's done it and shared the video to prove it.</p><p>A streamer who goes by Tigz has been acknowledged by Battlestate Games as the first player to find a way out of Tarkov in this first-person-extraction shooter. In a post captured on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRvD4dRjIqR/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>, the devs wrote, "Congratulations to Tigz on being the first to Escape From Tarkov. You survived. But at what cost."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996" data-ratio="1.3076923076923" data-width="442" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615996"></a><figcaption>The image sent to Tigz as proof of his accomplishment as the first player to escape from Tarkov.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4615996-escapefromtarkovtigz.jpg"></figure><p>Tigz also shared the video that demonstrated how he got his character out of Tarkov alive. But if you want to skip ahead to the actual escape, advance the clip to the 43 minute mark.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGpSMFwau4A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YGpSMFwau4A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's only been possible to escape since the game launched out of early access last month. But the developers didn't make it easy. Each attempt costs $5 million and the final quest looks like it's ridiculously over-the-top.</p><p>So far, only a handful of players have been able to follow Tigz's example and bust out of Tarkov. There are multiple endings in place for this game, and a player named Tsukinogi has been recognized as the first player to escape from Targov with the best possible ending.</p><p>If players purchased Escape from Tarkov before it was released on Steam, then they will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/" data-ref-id="1100-6534783">to buy the game all over again</a>. Battlestate Games has previously released a $150 Edge of Darkness limited edition that was said to include all future DLC. At a later point in time, Battlestate Games dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-tarkov-arena/" data-ref-id="5000-450666">Escape From Tarkov: Arena</a> and kept the game’s PvE mode as a separate $250 purchase. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">a backlash against the studio</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-boss-didnt-expect-players-to-get-mad-about-paid-pve-content/1100-6523084/" data-ref-id="1100-6523084">a subsequent apology from Battlestate Games</a> came with a promise to let Edge of Darkness owners access the PvE mode as well.</p>

                <p>The dream of <a href="https://skyblivion.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skyblivion</a> goes back over a decade as a team of fans came together to use <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's</a> engine to fully recreate and re-imagine <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/" data-ref-id="5000-22229">Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> as a modern RPG. At the beginning of 2023, the team set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">a 2025 premiere for Skyblivion</a>. However, that's no longer the plan and Skyblivion has been pushed to next year. The good news is that the latest dev video shows off how much has been finished and what remains to be done.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC6W0htYBOc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yC6W0htYBOc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyblivion lead Rebelzize narrates the video as he offers a guide to where things stand. According to Rebelzize, most of the work has already been done and over 70 volunteer contributors are still hard at work trying to get the ambitious mod across the finish line.</p><p>When this project was started, The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion was far out of date. Earlier this year, Bethesda released Oblivion Remastered, which could have taken the wind out of this team's project. Instead, Rebelzize and others praised the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster as a "win-win" for the community</a>. In recognition for their work, Bethesda gave <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p><p>However, it hasn't been entirely harmonious for team Skyblivion. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-is-still-aiming-for-2025-even-as-former-dev-calls-it-a-massive-mistake/1100-6534591/" data-ref-id="1100-6534591">a former member of the team</a> spoke out against efforts to rush the mod out before it's ready. As impressive as Skyblivion is, no one is getting paid for it, and the ex-team member is against the crunch-time mindset that was making things more difficult.</p><p>For now, it looks like Skyblivion is worth the wait. Although Bethesda does offer some support for mods on consoles, it will only be available on PC. Skyblivion will also require players to own both Elder Scrolls 5 and Elder Scrolls 4 in order to work.</p>

While Black Ops 7 is sticking to thematically appropriate operator skins, Season 11 of Call of Duty Mobile includes a major crossover with Street Fighter, which allows players to transform into the popular fighting characters and use their iconic fighting moves. This new season also adds a DMZ extraction mode, new loadout items to unlock, and special events.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Season_11_start_date_details">Season 11 start date details</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 11 starts on December 11 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.

There are also weapon blueprints, skins, and other cosmetics available to unlock for free.</p><p dir="ltr">For the premium tiers, the battle pass offers the "Mauy Claus" Santa operator skin for Ajax and the "Iron Kata" skin for Sparrowhawk. Holiday-themed weapon blueprints are included for the Krig 6 assault rifle, CBR4 submachine gun, and the season's new SO-14 marksman rifle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLK6ORbmUMM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qLK6ORbmUMM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="New_events">New events</h2><p dir="ltr">New events will allow players to earn Street Fighter-themed rewards and other cosmetics from Secret Caches.

Season 11 is themed around Street Fighter, and this brings new challenges and limited-time game modes inspired by the characters of the iconic fighting game.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer, Shoryu and Hadoken is a limited-time mode available across a select map pool. Scorestreaks are disabled in this mode, and operators enter the match equipped with only the Prizefighter gloves melee weapon and increased jump height, which is meant to reflect the martial style of Street Fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">Players melee and build up a rage meter until they earn enough to transform into either Hidora Kai for Ryu or Shigenori for Akuma. Ryu's move set offers his classic Hadoken projectile ability and his powerful wave motion fist attack, Shinku Hadoken. Akuma's combat style uses the Shoryuken rising uppercut and the Shun Goku Satsu attack. The first player to land enough eliminations is the winner.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle royale also has a limited-time Street Fighter mode. This lets players find holograms of four different Street Fighter characters on the mode's Isolated map. Interacting with the holograms for Ryu, Akuma, Chun-Li, and Cammy will let the player acquire their unique abilities and activate special attacks to use during the match.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="DMZ_Recon_mode">DMZ Recon mode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4615868-dmzreconnserpentislandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615868" data-ratio="0.56275780789629" data-width="1697" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4615868-dmzreconnserpentislandmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4615868"></a><figcaption>DMZ Recon Serpent Island map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4615868-dmzreconnserpentislandmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Mobile adds a new extraction mode inspired by Modern Warfare 2's DMZ called DMZ Recon. This introduces a brand-new map called Serpent Island, which is a large-scale map composed of multiple zones, including points of interest inspired by fan-favorite Call of Duty maps.

                <p>Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Ars Technica</a>, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a "large, open-world-type RPG" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.</p><p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," he said. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert previously described his new project as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monkey-island-creators-next-game-is-best-described-as-classic-zelda-meets-diablo-meets-thimbleweed-park" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,"</a> and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.</p><h2>"Horrible" publishing deals</h2><p>Gilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that "deals that publishers were offering were just horrible."</p><p>The kind of game Gilbert envisioned "isn't the big, hot item" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this," he explained.</p><p>Gilbert funded 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thimbleweed-park-review/1900-6416642/" data-ref-id="1900-6416642">Thimbleweed Park</a> on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.</p><p>The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be "very analytics-driven" and have devised their own formulas to "try to figure out how much money they could make." The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.</p><p>"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money," he said. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p><p>Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.</p>
