<p dir="ltr">However, there are a couple of caveats to consider. For starters, Arc Raiders broke the Steam record when including PvP extraction shooters, but it's arguably not a requirement to fit in the genre. Without PvP, Helldivers 2 holds the top spot for the genre, according to<a href="https://steamdb.info/tag/1199779/" rel="nofollow "> SteamDB</a>, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stop-shtting-your-pants-helldivers-2-boss-jokes-as-game-passes-500000-concurrents/1100-6534312/">saw a huge resurgence in player counts</a> when the game came to Xbox Series X|S in August. Meanwhile, Escape From Duckov has peaked on Steam with a little over 300,000 concurrent players and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/">outgunned Battlefield 6 briefly</a> last week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, Escape From Tarkov looms large in this discussion. The game that arguably put extraction shooters on the map <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-will-finally-escape-early-access-this-fall/1100-6534196/">will finally come to Steam on November 15</a> as part of the version 1.0 release. People who already own Escape From Tarkov <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/">will have to pay again to play on Steam</a>, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Arc Raiders is also available on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S--in addition to PC. So keep in mind the concurrent-player numbers are obviously larger than just what's seen on Steam. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-cross-play-and-cross-saves-explained/1100-6535834/">does have cross-play and cross-save</a>, too.

                <p>Before Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake was released last October, there was a report that the game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-playstation-console-exclusive-for-at-least-a-year/1100-6526604/" data-ref-id="1100-6526604">a timed exclusive for PlayStation 5</a> for at least a year. Now, the year is up and an updated listing by the Entertainment Software Rating Board appears to indicate that a leap to Xbox Series X|S is immanent.</p><p>The ESRB has slightly modified <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">its Silent Hill 2 page</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>) to state that it's certified for the "Xbox Series" consoles. The rating itself hasn't changed, and it's still M for Mature. However, Microsoft and Konami have yet to formally announce the port or set a date for it. We can't even say for certain if Silent Hill 2 will get a physical release on Xbox, or if it will be digital only.</p><p>For now, there are no signs on the ESRB page that Silent Hill 2 will be coming to Switch 2 any time soon. But it's not out of the realm of possibility for the future.</p><p>Following Bloober Team's success with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami announced that the studio is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. That project doesn't currently have a release window.</p><p>The most recent game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a>, was released last month to largely positive reviews. Konami announced that title alongside Silent Hill 2's remake, and Silent Hill: Townfall during the same livestream in 2022. Series producer Motoi Okamoto has said that the team revealed all three projects at once because, "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-producer-explains-why-konami-announced-three-games-at-once/1100-6535588/" data-ref-id="1100-6535588">We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series</a>."</p><p>Outside of the games, a new live-action film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, will be released on January 23, 2026. The movie will be an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, and sees the return of the original film's director, Christoph Gans.</p>

                <p>A single throwing knife was the most devastating weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> when the game first launched, and a few weeks later, Gearbox finally fixed the infamous tool. Seemingly gone for good, the "Crit Knife" has come back from the dead, as this week's update has restored it to <em>most</em> of its former glory.</p><p>Originally, the Crit Knife was creating an unintended damage loop that allowed players to melt through even the toughest bosses within seconds. You'd need a throwing knife with the Penetrator augment to achieve this effect, as it would increase your critical hit chance to 100% for five seconds. With the Crit Knife dominating the Borderlands 4 meta and overshadowing viable builds, it was eventually nerfed in the October 23 patch alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-horny-shield-wasnt-supposed-to-be-that-horny-actually/1100-6535701/" data-ref-id="1100-6535701">horny BDSM shield</a>.</p><p>This new version of the Crit Knife wasn't bad, but it definitely left a lot to be desired. Gearbox made it so that the Penetrator Augment would create a flat 30% critical hit chance for five seconds, which could actually reduce the effect if you had any buffs or gear equipped to increase it.</p><p>This week's patch has changed things up yet again, as a bug has now made the Penetrator Augment capable of adding an extra 30% critical hit chance--and it can stack when used--giving players up to 90% critical hit chance over the five-second window of opportunity.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!<br>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. <br>Silly but yeah. lmao.

Gearbox has been doing weekly updates and hotfixes to the game since launch, and this will likely be patched out soon.
