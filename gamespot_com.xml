                <p>Considering the popularity of the John Wick films, there aren't a lot of video games that let players assume control of the legendary killer. Now, there's going to be one fewer because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/john-wick-hex-review-tick-tock-wick/1900-6417333/" data-ref-id="1900-6417333">John Wick Hex</a> is being delisted later this week across PC and consoles.</p><p>Big Fan Games announced the news on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1405790/view/596280216846860675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">John Wick Hex's Steam page</a>. The game is being delisted on July 17, but players who purchase it ahead of time will still be able to play their copies. Fans who own a physical copy of John Wick Hex will also continue to have access to this tactical action RPG.</p><p>The announcement didn't include a reason for the delisting, but it stands to reason that the John Wick rights may have simply run out for the title. John Wick Hex was originally published by Good Shepherd Entertainment, and it was released on PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. Good Shepherd's parent company, Devolver Digital, shifted the publishing rights for John Wick Hex to another one of its smaller companies, Big Fan Games, in 2024.</p><p>John Wick Hex is currently <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/john-wick-hex?irclickid=3NISJV1K-xycUhN0CIwuRwDlUksSc4S9QW9VXI0&amp;sharedid=&amp;irpid=1804712&amp;utm_source=impact&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=Fandom%20-%20Gamespot&amp;utm_content=1804712&amp;utm_term=Online%20Tracking%20Link&amp;irgwc=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on Humble Bundle for only $4</a>. The game is $20 on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/john-wick-hex/9PB1C8S0922M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1050-CUSA18381_00-JOHNWICKHPS4SIEA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PSN</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/john-wick-hex-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoreGxJLXrDI1iJgUHBgM7zKG_ts299vG96eJYjrdYaS6-jGZ0VP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Online</a>.</p><p>In 2022, Lionsgate acknowledged that it had fielded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-big-aaa-john-wick-video-game-could-happen-lionsgate-ceo-says/1100-6508901/" data-ref-id="1100-6508901">multiple proposals for a John Wick AAA game</a>. The studio confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-5-confirmed-john-wick-video-game-proposals-moving-ahead/1100-6514599/" data-ref-id="1100-6514599">discussions about another John Wick game</a> were still active in 2023, but nothing concrete has emerged. More recently, Ana de Armas reprised her role as Eve Macarro from the John Wick spinoff, Ballerina, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-ballerinas-killer-abilities-in-call-of-dutys-new-john-wick-crossover-out-today/1100-6531996/" data-ref-id="1100-6531996">to appear in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a> as a playable character.</p>

                <p>Rain falls, wind blows, and the newest PlayStation 5 system update isn't introducing anything revolutionary this week. Sony has confirmed that the Version: 25.05-11.60.00 update is now live for PS5 consoles, adding the usual amount of extra stability that you'd expect with these firmware patches.</p><p>"We've improved system software performance and stability," <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-za/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the very brief patch notes read</a>.</p><p>The previous system update also added a small stability update to PS5, with the last substantial patch being the Version: 25.03-11.20.00 release. This added audio focus--a feature designed to support broader accessibility and allow players to hear quiet in-game sounds and voice chat more clearly--and it also brought back the home screen themes inspired by various PlayStation generations.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, the next big first-party game for the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-check-out-over-40-new-screenshots-of-the-ps5-exclusive/2900-6494/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, was the main focus of a recent State of Play livestream. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-35-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-game/2900-6758/">We got to see dozens of new details</a> and a healthy dose of gameplay for the upcoming samurai sandbox, as well as new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-a-limited-edition-playstation-5/1100-6533106/">limited-edition PS5 consoles inspired by it</a>.
