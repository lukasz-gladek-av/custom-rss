                <p>Bungie has admitted to finding stolen art assets in its upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>. Graphic artist Antireal has taken to X to claim that Bungie used their poster designs from 2017 without compensation or credit. Bungie admits the claims, and says it will undertake a complete review of the game's assets.</p><p>Antireal <a href="https://x.com/4nt1r34l/status/1923067988871147605" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted to X</a> on May 15, claiming that "The Marathon alpha released recently and its environments are covered with assets lifted from poster designs I made in 2017." They tagged both Bungie and Marathon's franchise art director, Joseph Cross.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496212-marathon-assets%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496212-marathon-assets%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496212"></a><figcaption>Artist Antireal posted comparison between in-game screenshots and their original art.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496212-marathon-assets%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>They continue, "Bungie is of course not obligated to hire me when making a game that draws overwhelmingly from the same design language I have refined for the last decade, but clearly my work was good enough to pillage for ideas and plaster all over their game without pay or attribution."</p><p>Antireal explains that they don't have the resources "nor the energy" to pursue the matter legally, but that it isn't the first time they've faced similar issues. Antireal even<a href="https://x.com/solarphy/status/1923081236567728236" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> confirms</a> that Cross has followed their account "for a few years."</p><p>Bungie responded via its own <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/1923217324384903262" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon dev team </a>X account to say that it "immediately investigated" the concerns, and "confirmed that a former Bungie artist included these in a texture sheet that was ultimately used in-game." It goes on to state that the issue was "unknown" to the existing art team, and it is reviewing how the oversight happened.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496213"></a><figcaption>Comparisons between Antireal's art and in-game screenshots from Marathon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496213-marathon-assets%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>Bungie also says it reached out to Antireal to discuss the matter. "[We] are committed to do right by the artist," it confirms. "As a matter of policy, we do not use the work of artists without their permission." The developer also confirms that to prevent "similar issues" happening again, it will conduct a "thorough review" of game assets, with particular emphasis on the former artist responsible for the issue.</p><p>However, it's not the first time Bungie has been caught using assets without permission, as X user <a href="https://x.com/GaminCounselor/status/1923219998379544675" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GaminCounselor</a> points out. In 2021, the Witch Queen DLC trailer featured fan art of Xivu Arath without credit. In 2023, a Destiny 2 cutscene used near-identical fan art without permission. In 2024, the Ace of Spades NERF gun merchandise appeared to copy a fan-created design. In all cases Bungie reached out to the artists to apologize, credit, or compensate them--but four occurrences of art theft in as many years raises questions about Bungie's internal policies when it comes to these matters.</p><p>Bungie plans to host <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/marathonthegame" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Marathon stream</a> later today (May 16) at 1PM PT / 6PM ET. It's unlikely that it will address the asset theft during the stream, but given the interactive nature of Twitch, viewers may well have comment to pass. Marathon is set for release on September 23, and while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it won't be "full price,"</a> Bungie says it will be "a premium title."</p>

                <p>Epic Games has announced that Apple has "blocked" its submission to the App Store and Epic Games Store on iOS, meaning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> won't be available on Apple devices globally for the foreseeable future.</p><p>The news comes around two weeks after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">Epic Games announced</a> that Fortnite would be back on iOS, after a judge filed a major injunction against Apple. A post on the official Fortnite X account reads, "Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union. Now, sadly, Fortnite on iOS will be offline worldwide until Apple unblocks it."</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1920878504284975585" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> on May 9 that the game had been submitted for review on the App Store, however the company was left waiting an unusually long time without hearing back from Apple with either approval or rejection. Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/distribute/app-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer website</a> states that 90% of submissions are reviewed within 24 hours, and says developers will be emailed with any status changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496204" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496204"></a><figcaption>Fortnite won't be on iOS devices any time soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4496204-fortnite-apple.jpg"></figure><p>Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney recently gave an update on the situation via X, suggesting that Apple may be "weaponizing" its App Review process against Epic. Sweeney said in a reply to another user that Epic Games had followed up with Apple via email on May 13, but still hadn't heard back. On the 14th, he <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922724874264412295" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Epic had to withdraw the previous version of Fortnite submitted to Apple and re-submit it due to pending updates.</p><p>"We need to release a weekly Fortnite update with new content this Friday, and all platforms must update simultaneously," Sweeney said in the X reply. "Our release planning relies on platforms supporting app developers like us releasing apps," he added in a subsequent reply. "There is no way a rapidly evolving multi-platform game like Fortnite can operate if platforms use their power or processes to obstruct."</p><p>"Apple's App Review team should be free to review all submitted apps promptly and accept or reject according to the plain language of their guidelines," Sweeney said in another <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1923214117894029475" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent post</a>. "App Review shouldn't be weaponized by senior management as a tool to delay or obstruct competition, due process, or free speech."</p><p>Epic Games' legal battle with Apple over its App Store practices has been ongoing since 2020, so it's no surprise that Apple is refusing to give in so easily. In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">recent update</a>, judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled against Apple in a major injunction, and even referred the case for possible contempt charges. Apple disagreed with the judge's decision and said it would be appealing.</p>
