                <p>Earlier this month, a report emerged that Microsoft was forming a new committee within Activision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">guide the future of the Call of Duty franchise</a>. Now, that future may be coming into focus as a new report suggests that Sledgehammer Games will be taking the lead on Call of Duty's 2027 release. </p><p>TheGhostOfHope--a Call of Duty leaker who has accurately reported on previous developments in the franchise--is reporting that Sledgehammer Games' next Call of Duty game will follow Infinity Ward's 2026 title, "which is presumably [Modern Warfare 4]." Hope also stated that Sledgehammer Games' COD is possibly Advanced Warfare 2 or "something new."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/theghostofhope/status/1860508353958498481?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I am hearing about Sledgehammer Games future with Call of Duty:<br>Sledgehammer Games are currently slated to lead their own Call Of Duty in 2027. This comes after Infinity Ward's game in 2026 which is presumably MW4. <br>COD2027 is currently NOT a Year 2 Modern Warfare game… <a href="https://t.co/xR3UYwsjfm" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/xR3UYwsjfm</a></p>  — Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1860508353958498481?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Because Activision releases new Call of Duty games annually, a number of the publisher's smaller development studios are working on concurrent projects in order to maintain that pace. Sledgehammer Games has assisted other Activision studios on several Call of Duty games, while leading development on a handful of its own titles, including 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-review-return-of-the-makarov/1900-6418152/" data-ref-id="1900-6418152">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a>.</p><p>Last month's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> release set records for the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-had-biggest-launch-period-player-total-in-series-history/1100-6528034/" data-ref-id="1100-6528034">according to Activision</a>. The publisher credits Black Ops 6's availability on Game Pass, consoles, and PC for lifting its 30-day launch period to all-time highs in total players, total hours played, and total matches played. The game also added some fresh touches to the franchise, including DLC that gives players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-now-lets-you-become-a-muscly-shark/1100-6528027/" data-ref-id="1100-6528027">the ability to suit up as a shark</a>. Activision launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ranked-play-starts-now-rewards-revealed/1100-6527922/" data-ref-id="1100-6527922">Ranked Play for Black Ops 6 earlier this month</a>, which gives the best players a chance to go head-to-head using the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions as COD's official esports league.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">2025 is going to be a massive year for Metroid Prime. Not only is the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launching on Nintendo Switch, but now fans can look forward to a new, official art book covering the original trilogy from premium game-guide publisher Piggyback. Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective is a 212-page hardcover edition launching in Summer 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.piggyback.com/us/guide/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piggbyback's official announcement</a>, the publisher worked directly with Nintendo and Retro Studios to create Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective. The book will feature "concept drawings, sketches, and assorted illustrations" from the original Metroid Prime, Prime 2: Echoes, Prime 3: Corruption, and the recent Metroid Prime Remastered on Switch. The art is presented alongside "exclusive commentary from Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe, as well as the esteemed Retro Studios." Tanabe also contributed a foreword to the book and each section features written intros from Retro Studios staff. The hardcover book is printed on premium, sheet-fed art paper with stitch binding and etched metallic foil cover art featuring Samus Aran's iconic Varia suit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405390" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405390"></a><figcaption>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4405390-mptrilogyartbook.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Official Art and Making of Metroid Prime 1-3 will launch for $50 sometime in Summer 2025. No preorders are available yet, but judging by Piggypack's previous book launches, we expect The Official Art and Making of Metroid Prime 1-3 will be on Amazon soon.</p><p dir="ltr">If Piggyback's other books are any indication, Metroid fans are in for a treat. Not only is it rare for Nintendo games to get this sort of behind-the-scenes examination, but Piggyback is behind some of the coolest game guides of the last several years, including the official guides for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Complete-Official-Expanded/dp/1911015486?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1913330001?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tears of the Kingdom</a>--both of which are some of the coolest Zelda collector's items currently available. Other highlights include Piggyback's guides for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cyberpunk-2077-Complete-Official-Guide-Collectors/dp/1911015761?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-getting-an-official-collectors-edition-strategy-guide/1100-6527284/" data-ref-id="1100-6527284">official Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">More Video Game Book Deals</h2><p dir="ltr">For anyone curious about Piggyback's other work, several of the company's books are discounted at Amazon right now, including both Zelda guides.
