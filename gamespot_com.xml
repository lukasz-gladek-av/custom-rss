                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jump-space/" data-ref-id="5000-624476">Jump Space</a> is almost ready to exit space port and enter early access. Ahead of the game's debut later this month, Keepsake Games has set the price for Jump Space and laid out the update calendar well into 2026.</p><p>On Bluesky, Keepsake announced that Jump Space's early access release will be available for $20 on Xbox Series X|S and PC on September 19. Chapter 1: The Resistance Coalition will begin at the start of early access, with Chapter 2: Atira Strikes Back launching by early 2026. In a series of short updates in that time frame, Keepsake plans to introduce text chat, hangar vendors, a ship shield revamp, melee weapons, an expanded story, new missions, photo mode, and other additions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165" data-ratio="4.0733333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567165"></a><figcaption>The roadmap for Jump Space's updates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4567165-jumpspaceroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>In Q1 2026, Chapter 3: Secrets of the Telmari will bring support for a first-person mode, more sectors, a scanner revamp, voice chat, new enemies, and a ground boss into the game. There are plans for Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption before the game exits early access. However, there are no dates or concrete details about when that might occur.</p><p>Until fairly recently, this game was known as Jump Ship before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-forced-to-change-name-to-jump-space-due-to-trademark-issues/1100-6533707/" data-ref-id="1100-6533707">the name was changed over trademark issues</a>. Jump Space is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games-steam/2900-6905/" data-ref-id="2900-6905">co-op game</a> that brings together up to four players as the crew of a ship that can control and repair their shared vessel. The gameplay resembles Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, with some additional sci-touches touches like planetary exploration and space walks. It's a dangerous galaxy out there, and players will run into trouble when enemies appear during on-foot encounters or during space combat when the crew is still on their ship. However, the game is strictly PvE, rather than PvP.</p><p>Keepsake Games has previously mentioned that Jump Space will feature several "handcrafted missions with random elements" to keep the game fresh. More than 1 million players have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted Jump Space on Steam</a>. For now, the game will only be available on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

<p dir="ltr">The T.E.D.D. operator now looks less human and more like the robot originally featured in Black Ops 2's Zombies mode. The flesh has melted off his face to show more of his robotic features. The bonus T.E.D.D. skin added to the Vault Edition bundle will look more like the original Black Ops 7 design that was announced, but Activision says it does have some minor changes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567169" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567169"></a><figcaption>Redesigned Vault operators</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4567169-bo7-ve-update-001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Karma, her holographic plates and visor have been adjusted. This redesign shows more of her face than the original version. Harper's operator skin also has slight adjustments with armor now recolored and looking more streamlined. The only operator who didn't receive a change is Reaper EWR-3.</p><p dir="ltr">The operators' new looks can be seen in the image above. A more detailed 360-degree-look at the skins can be seen in the videos shared on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/black-ops-7-vault-edition-operators-update" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty's blog</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says these changes were made as part of Call of Duty's commitment to the "authentic look and feel of Black Ops 7," and after receiving community feedback specifically related to the Black Ops 7 Vault Edition operators.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher recently made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/">changes to Call of Duty's Carry Forward program</a>, allowing only specific skins and items to transfer from Black Ops 6 to Black Ops 7. This will include some of the Zombies-themed skins players earned by completing the main story quests, but wacky skins like Ninja Turtles and Beavis and Butt-Head won't carry over.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. More details and gameplay will be revealed during Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-release-date-set-for-november-cod-next-coming-in-september/1100-6534015/">Call of Duty: Next event</a> on September 30.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is celebrating the release of its new Marvel-themed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735">Blitz Royale</a> island by offering a new free skin that everyone can earn this weekend. According to in-game messaging, any players who earn a win this weekend in the Six Stack (Pure Chaos) variety of the recently added Blitz Royale mode will be granted the new Bug Punk Sunny skin on Monday. Yes, this is the first-ever new version of Sunny, the popular alien fangirl character from the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4567116"></a><figcaption>You can earn the Bug Punk Sunny skin in Fortnite Blitz Royale this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4567116-bug_punk_sunny_%28featured%29_-_outfit_-_fortnite.jpg"></figure><p>For those who aren't up to date on Fortnite's many different battle royale modes, Blitz Royale is a small-scale mode with a max of 32 players and matches that last five minutes or less that was added this summer as an appeal to mobile gamers after Fortnite returned to iOS in the USA. But Blitz Royale is not exclusive to mobile devices--you can play the mode on any platform Fortnite works on. And in Six Stack (Pure Chaos) mode, there are teams of six players, and no bots or skill-based matchmaking, and so with the quick nature of these games this version of the mode tends to get pretty wild.</p><p>It's already a pretty momentous occasion for Blitz Royale, which replaced its entire map on Friday with a new island that's full of stuff owned by Tony Stark/Iron Man--in fact, these locations come from Chapter 2 Season 4, which was the first full-on Marvel season back in the fall of 2020. But the makeover isn't just an aesthetic one, because the loot pool is also now full of Marvel items, including the frequently maligned War Machine items that were everyone's bane during Chapter 5 Season 4.</p><p>Bug Punk Sunny is the ninth free skin that Epic Games has offered Fortnite players this year, and there was a tenth skin, Skulldroid, that cost 100 V-Bucks for folks who had received free Twitch drops of his accessories. That's already more free skins in 2025 than we'd normally get in a full calendar year, and we're still three months away from Winterfest, which has traditionally been Fortnite's biggest source of free skins.</p>
