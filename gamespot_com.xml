                <p>Helldivers 2 is having a big day. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">launched today, August 26, on Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it also got a big new update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">including a Halo crossover</a>. All of the excitement has led to a surge in players and sales for Helldivers 2--here are some of the key things to know about Helldivers 2's latest success.</p><h2><strong>No. 1 on Steam</strong></h2><p>On Steam, Helldivers 2 is the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top-selling game overall in the US based on revenue</a>. Helldivers 2 is also No. 2 in the UK. Filtered by global stats, Helldivers 2 is No. 2, only behind Counter-Strike 2.</p><p>In terms of player numbers on Steam, Helldivers 2 reached more than 114,000 peak concurrent players today, August 26, meaning the game is inside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's top 10 overall most-played games.</a> This is the highest figure since June.</p><p>Across all platforms, Helldivers 2 has reached more than 200,000 players today, <a href="https://x.com/TheColeBrewTv/status/1960346775736459287" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to the game's own data.</a> Specific player-number data for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, however, is unknown.</p><h2><strong>Mysterious new patch</strong></h2><p>Helldivers 2 got a new update today, but the patch notes have not been posted. As such, people are theorizing that the update is hiding things that the developer wants players to discover organically. The lack of patch notes has <a href="https://x.com/Helldivers_NOW/status/1960264615679390163" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inspired some memes.</a> The studio also announced more upcoming Helldivers 2 content, including<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952"> Into the Unjust</a>, which launches on September 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXeRkqH2Gos" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qXeRkqH2Gos" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>Launch party and an Xbox button</strong></h2><p>Developer Arrowhead Studios held a <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1960250153467531332/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launch party for Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a> and the studio also had a dedicated Xbox button that the studio's CCO Johan Pilestedt ceremoniously pressed to launch the game.</p><p>Helldivers 2 is one of PlayStation's first releases on Xbox. The MLB The Show series is now on Xbox, but it's co-published with Major League Baseball. Also released today was Gears of War: Reloaded for PlayStation 5, meaning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">PlayStation and Xbox swapped former console exclusives today.</a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/">Baby Steps</a>, the hilariously awkward walking simulator from Devolver Digital, has taken a more cautious step back. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">In the looming shadow of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, the team announced a new release date for September 23. However, the developers released a fun new video of Nate, the game's perpetually off-balance, onesie-clad walker, attempting (and failing) to climb a massive statue of Hornet, the star of Silksong.</p><p>This isn't the first game to quietly adjust its footing in the wake of Silksong's long-awaited launch and an increasingly packed fall release schedule. Demonschool, another upcoming indie title from publisher Ysbryd Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/" data-ref-id="1100-6534245">has recently pushed its release to November, retreating from its original September 3 launch date.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Behind Baby Steps' slapstick charm is an all-star indie dev trio: Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch. Together, they've crafted a seemingly absurd yet oddly touching game about Nate, an unmotivated basement-dweller who discovers his one true gift: walking. One foot at a time, players guide Nate through a mysterious, scenic world using physics-driven controls that transform every hill into a mountain and every step into a monumental achievement.</p><p>With its new release date giving it some breathing room, Baby Steps now has a chance to shine on its own. Players will now help Nate lurch and flop through a surprisingly emotional journey filled with awkward encounters and scenic landscapes on September 23, on PC and PS5.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Scopely has revealed new details on the game's next season, Tales of Transformation. The season will start on September 2 and will run through December 2, with some of the highlights including a new transformation for a legendary Pokemon, more Mega Pokemon, and a few new pocket monsters will be coming to the game.</p><p>Kicking things off is confirmation that Keldeo will be able to transform into its Resolute Form during a season-long Special Research journey. In the Pokemon games, this form gives the mythical Pokemon more power and speed, and players who have already caught Keldeo can earn Keldeo Candy to power it up further.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxQyaeZu_d8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GxQyaeZu_d8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fans of Mega Pokemon can look forward to Mega Raid Days throughout the season, as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Metagross will all appear during this event. There'll also be new Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon appearing during Tales of Transformation, like Dynamax Abra, Dynamax Duraludon, and Gigantamax Garbodor. Anyone looking to capture some new critters can also hunt for Dripplin and Hydrapple next month.</p><p>Dripplin was introduced in the Teal Mask expansion for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and when certain conditions are met, it evolves into the Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon Hydrapple. It's the third branch of potential evolutions for Applin, the apple-inspired Pokemon that can also evolve into Flapple and Appletun.</p><p>Finally, players looking for a real challenge can take part in Shadow Raids to face off against Shadow Groudon and several other Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-is-completely-overhauling-its-leveling-system-in-october-to-be-more-rewarding/1100-6534230/">Pokemon Go will also overhaul progression</a>. Starting October 15, a new update will see the level cap raised, increased rewards, and much more added to the game.</p>
