                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">surprise launch</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered last week has us all feeling nostalgic about the classic game, including the team who created Oblivion back in 2006. In a new video, Bethesda reunited the original Oblivion team to watch a documentary about the game's creation almost two decades later.</p><p>"This is going to be really f**king awkward watching this," Todd Howard says, before a clip of his younger self plays admitting he was in the chess club in school. For the most part the video is wholesome, with the long-term Bethesda employees reminiscing about a time when the company only had around 40 people on staff--it has around 450 now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A9oMOem2t4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4A9oMOem2t4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I remember all the struggles we went through making it," one developer said of the old footage, while others on the team spoke about how ambitious the project was for its time. "I guess I didn't know it at the time, but looking back, we were doing impossible things," another developer added.</p><p>The Oblivion team also discuss how the game was something of a turning point for Bethesda. "It was the 2.0 version of the studio," one dev said. "It is the start of this group of people working together working together, making this great game."</p><p>"It was impossibly hard to do what we wanted to do," Howard adds. Oblivion went on to become a commercial and critical hit for the studio, winning numerous awards and setting the standard for fantasy RPGs for years to come. The recent surprise-release of Oblivion: Remastered has reignited that same fervor in fans, with nostalgia around the remaster running high. The remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-hits-100000-concurrent-players-on-steam-just-hours-after-launch/1100-6531026/" data-ref-id="1100-6531026">hit 100,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam just hours after release, and the numbers have stayed high in the week since.</p><p>Just getting into the remaster?

                <p>With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> set to usher the next big console launch this June, EA founder Trip Hawkins has commented on the future of gaming consoles.</p><p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@TripHawkins/next-gen-game-platforms-e5d2c4e0c3d9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Hawkins said he predicts cloud-enabled technologies to dominate going forward, predicting that the days of a "conventional" console selling 150 million units are over.</p><p>"As for the next generation of consoles, we're now in a glide plane where the cloud is everything and it will be far more convenient to have rack-mounted GPUs in data centers than to try to convince the public to buy more consoles, at higher prices, than they have in the past," he said. "We will never see another conventional console sell 150 million units, like the PlayStation 2 did."</p><p>Hawkins went on to say the "technical prowess" of PCs, along with existing current-generation consoles and newer smartphones, might be "good enough" for people.</p><p>"Even for Sony and Microsoft it will soon make more sense to focus on their game-streaming subscription services instead of losing money on hardware manufacturing and marketing," he said. "Brands like PlayStation and Xbox can be maintained yet will also be more easily available on PCs and billions of smart devices, for a win-win among the cloud providers, game brands and players."</p><p>The original Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 150 million units</a>, and that number is going to climb higher when Nintendo releases its next earnings report this month.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, Hawkins said he expects it to clear 100 million lifetime sales, but given his earlier comments, he doesn't anticipate it reaching the heights of the original Switch.</p><p>Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-generation console</a> that could also included a handheld, while Sony is believed to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6</a>. Release dates for both, however, remain unknown.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft is already heavily invested in game-streaming technologies, while Sony allows users to stream games as well. Microsoft has said that game-streaming is just one possible way forward; it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-stresses-that-streaming-won/1100-6479243/" data-ref-id="1100-6479243">continue to release dedicated gaming consoles, too</a>.</p><p>Hawkins left EA all the way back in 1991. Among other things, he was instrumental at EA in signing John Madden to a development deal for what would become the juggernaut Madden football series. A Madden movie is in the works, with John Mulaney set to play Hawkins. The veteran executive recently discussed the film, saying director David O. Russell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-founder-says-madden-moviemakers-had-no-interest-in-involving-him/1100-6531230/" data-ref-id="1100-6531230">declined to work with him.</a></p><p>After EA, Hawkins founded 3DO to create a new gaming console, but it never took off. </p>
