For example, you can use the standard Xbox controller layout for first-person shooters, then flip to the six-button module for fighting games. We're not sure how helpful the extra two face buttons on the left module would be, but Turtle Beach was smart to move the D-pad into the other slot for fighting games, side-scrollers, and other games that feel more natural with D-pad movement controls.</p><p>Both thumbsticks use Hall Effect anti-drift sensors.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">While the reversible modules are the Stealth Pivotâ€™s main features, the controller can be customized in other ways, such as adjustable trigger and thumbstick sensitivity, four remappable microswitch buttons, adjustable trigger locks, and digital or analog modes for the D-pad. </p><p dir="ltr">The Stealth Pivot sports some other cool features, including a mini-LED which is used to configure up to five custom control profiles, adjust settings, and even display social notifications or other alerts. It also supports rumble and various Turtle Beach audio enhancement features like EQ presets, chat volume mixing, and more. It can connect via 2.4GHz wireless, Bluetooth 5.2, or wired USB to Xbox consoles, PC, or mobile. In wireless mode, it offers up to 20 hours of battery life and has quick charging via USB-C. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241" data-ratio="0.41" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392241"></a><figcaption>Stealth Pivot's rotating modules</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4392241-unnamed%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Turtle Beach brought over many of the Stealth Pivot's features from the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stealth Ultra</a>, which released last holiday for $200. The Stealth Ultra uses microswitches for all of its buttons, while microswitches appear to be limited to the remappable back buttons on the Pivot. The Ultra also has two nice bonuses you won't find with the Pivot: a carrying case and charging stand.</p><p dir="ltr">Until we get our hands on the Pivot, we won't know how the build quality compares to the Ultra, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/turtle-beach-stealth-ultra-controller-review-a-worthy-elite-series-2-rival/1100-6520062/" data-ref-id="1100-6520062">impressed us when we tested it</a> last year. That said, the Pivot's rotating modules, at face value, are probably more important than microswitches and carrying cases for many Xbox and PC users. And if you want microswitch buttons, we'd now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/" data-ref-id="1100-6526158">recommend the recently released Razer Wolverine V3 Pro</a> over the Stealth Ultra. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer's first wireless controller for Xbox and PC</a> also costs $200 and is a better overall <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-one-wireless-controller-elite-series-2%2F-%2FA-76439797&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fturtle-beachs-modular-xbox-wireless-controller-looks-cool-and-is-cheaper-than-expected%2F1100-6527472%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2</a> alternative than the Stealth Ultra.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The Stealth Pivot is the latest modular controller on the market, but not the only one.

                <p>For anyone who has ever watched an Indiana Jones movie, there's no question about where the title character stands on Nazis. He's been punching them in the face ever since Raiders of the Lost Ark hit theaters in 1981. Nazis have also been recurring villains in two of the four films that followed. But Bethesda's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will further emphasis the franchise's anti-Nazi stance with an in-game statement.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-includes-warning-denouncing-nazis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, The Great Circle's developer, MachineGames, added the following disclaimer: "The story and contents of this game are not intended to and should not be construed in any way to condone, glorify, or endorse the beliefs, ideologies, events, actions, persons, or behavior of the Nazi and fascist regimes, nor any other regimes or to trivialize any war crimes, genocide, and other crimes against humanity."</p><p>This statement comes amidst <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-scholz-says-dark-neo-nazi-networks-are-rise-2024-01-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a resurgence in neo-Nazi activity</a>, in both Europe and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/27/neonazis-ai-hitler-videos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in America</a>. The Indiana Jones movies have never really dealt with the weightier real-world implications of the Nazi atrocities, and the game will follow in those footsteps with some history mixed with fantasy elements. But rest assured, Dr. Jones will be dealing with the game's Nazis in the same way he's always done for the last 43 years.</p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>

At last, the joys of Ghost Huntin' are available to all.</p><p dir="ltr">Phasmophobia--which launched in September 2020 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-winners-and-game-of-the-year/1100-6485360/">took home the award for Best Debut Game</a> just three months later--now features cross-play in addition to console compatibility, meaning players can face the paranormal (or run screaming from it) with friends on any platform. The console launch comes alongside a new game update called the Crimson Eye, which is available now for all platforms, and features everything from the return of a heart-stopping seasonal event to bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1374846049" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

This year, the Blood Moon is back and bigger than ever," the game's website explains in <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-crimson-eye" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post</a>. "Paranormal energy has drastically increased in several locations, resulting in a new weather type, The Blood Moon. Enter these cursed locations and complete investigations, optional objectives and photograph any Blood Altars you may find to earn Blood Points. Work together with the Ghost Huntin' Community to collect Blood Points and earn brand-new rewards. Be warned, during the Blood Moon, ghosts will be empowered and stronger than ever."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post noted that accessing Blood Moon (and all "future seasonal or temporary events") will require an online connection, even when playing solo. This is due to the fact that temporary in-game events bring with them "a lot of technical changes," so keeping players online when interacting with live/seasonal events "will allow [Kinetic Games] to keep track of the event progress and make live changes on our cloud servers, if needed."</p><p dir="ltr">The Crimson Eye update also adds an Event Board to the Warehouse. The Event Board features "leaflets for current in-game events and challenges," which allow players to individually track their progress for each event they're taking part in. The game's photo cork board has been moved to the truck parked inside the Warehouse to make room for the Event Board, which is located between the truck and the Warehouse's door. The Event Board currently features two new challenges: Ranger Challenge and Sunny Meadows Survival.</p><p dir="ltr">Other improvements include a physics upgrade that makes doors <em>much</em> less frustrating. Moving doors can no longer push players out of the way (great for those moments when one's teammates can't seem to decide if they're coming or going), and doors can no longer be pulled off their hinges. Additionally, players can no longer be pushed through walls or other solid objects, and players suffering low frame rates can finally cross "accidentally clipping through the floor of Point Hope" off their list of totally rational fears, as the floor has evidently been reinforced with low-FPS-proof wood.</p><p>Phasmophobia's Crimson Eye update patch notes are listed in full below.
