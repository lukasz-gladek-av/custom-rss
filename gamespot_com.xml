                <p>In February 2004, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-583534">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> was a hit out of the gate when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-spin-off-sells-half-a-million-copies-in-its-first-week/1100-6521307/" data-ref-id="1100-6521307">sold one million copies during its first week</a> in early access. Now, this top-down single-player shooter is ready for its full launch next month. And as announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/" data-ref-id="2900-6888">Gamescom</a>, Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor is also heading to Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ_LRBbqyWE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lZ_LRBbqyWE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor will hit PC and Xbox Series X|S on September 17. GameSpot's Chris Pereira <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactics-vampire-survivors-style-game-excels-by-giving-you-something-new-to-do/1100-6521414/" data-ref-id="1100-6521414">greatly enjoyed Survivor in early access</a>, and compared it to Vampire Survivor. The game places players in control of a single dwarf miner, who can assume one of four classes: Driller, Engineer, Scout, and Gunner. Each class gives the dwarf different abilities and options as he explores Hoxxes IV, a procedurally generated planet filled with hostile aliens and riches beyond imagining.</p><p>Ghost Ship Games set the date for Survivor's release earlier this year, while noting that the decision to launch forced the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-1-0-launches-in-september-minus-one-mode/1100-6530779/" data-ref-id="1100-6530779">to drop Endless Mode from the game</a>. The devs at Funday Games noted that keeping Endless Mode posed several technical challenges that would have bogged down the game's release. However, there is still a plan to add Endless Mode to Survivor at a later date.</p><p>This isn't the only spin-off from the popular shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>. Ghost Ship Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-deep-rock-galactic-roguelite-shooter-is-on-the-way/1100-6518217/" data-ref-id="1100-6518217">a roguelite spin-off from the game</a> in the works called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core/" data-ref-id="5000-606212">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a>. That game doesn't currently have a release date, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core-goes-even-deeper-with-new-trailer/1100-6530780/" data-ref-id="1100-6530780">a trailer for Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> was shared earlier this year.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">NIS America has revealed that Ys X: Proud Nordics will arrive on Switch 2 and PC early next year in the US. The company calls this the definitive edition of the RPG, as it boasts a new storyline, mechanics, and dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">Ys X: Proud Nordics launched on Switch 2 last month in Japan. Originally, the RPG came out in 2023 in Japan before NIS America <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-making-its-way-to-the-west-later-this-year/1100-6521078/">brought Ys X: Nordics to the West in 2024</a> for PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. So far, there haven't been any details about a possible upgrade path for Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 or PC. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">paid Switch 2 upgrades</a> for Nintendo's new system as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">free patches</a> for the hybrid system since it came out in June.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgJnBtV-j4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjgJnBtV-j4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Per usual, Ys X follows Adol Christin (the protagonist of every Ys game), though this time he's joined by a sailor named Karja. The game sees the duo dealing with the "looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr," per a press release. "Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!"</p><p dir="ltr">Intriguingly, Ys X actually takes place after Ys II and features naval combat for the first time in the franchise. No previous knowledge is needed with Ys X, however, since it's a standalone story. In addition to Switch 2, Ys X: Proud Nordics can be found on three different PC storefronts: Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to wait, the original Ys X: Nordics is on sale for $30 on PS5 and $35 on Switch.</p><p><strong>Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

                <p>High on Life 2 continues the absurd tendencies of the original and will feature a playable version of Sega's Bible Adventures game.</p><p>Creative director Mikey Spano from developer Squanch Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P45cJ2HdFh4?si=-VPiOXZCpOCcU6LD&amp;t=15141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed at Gamescom</a> that Richard Kind's character, Senator Muppy Doo, can factory reset your game, prompting a Bible Adventures takeover. The three games included with Bible Adventures--Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath--are playable during this takeover. You can see how this unfolds in the video below.</p><p>Spano said someone at Squanch Games has "great connections" in the video game industry and helped get the rights sorted out to make this happen. When the idea came up to have this kind of in-game takeover with another game, Spano said it was his "dream" for Bible Adventures to be that game, but he didn't imagine it would work out. It did, and Spano said he's floored.</p><p>"A terrible video game based on the Bible is like the best thing I've ever heard in my life. It sucks so bad to play. It's great," he said.</p><p>In the original High on Life, the 1990 movie Demon Wind was watchable from start to finish, and Spano said the team at Squanch Games wanted to find a way to up the ante with the sequel.</p><p>High on Life 2 launches in February 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it'll also be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>. It's been a busy week for Game Pass announcements, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">many more games announced for the service as day-one releases.</a></p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>The idea for the original High on Life was conceived by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, who later left the studio amid domestic violence allegations.</p>

                <p>What do you have when you take cozy cooking games with monster fighting? You have the cleverly titled Beastro, from Timberline Studios. This upcoming game combines cooking game mechanics, laidback farming, and strategic deckbuilding combat to deliver a fresh take on the adventure genre. In Beastro, the idea of saving the world begins with preparing the perfect meal.</p><p>Set to launch in 2026 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S (available day one with Xbox Game Pass), Beastro follows Panko, a young fox and chef who suddenly finds himself in charge of a village eatery after his mentor mysteriously disappears.</p><p>As Panko, players will manage the restaurant, grow ingredients on the farm, forage in the wild, and serve local patrons. But there's more to Panko’s new role--he also must feed the Caretakers, adventurers who are the last line of defense against looming threats beyond the village walls. You can check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ3NM3hZD1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fZ3NM3hZD1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each Caretaker comes from a different "flavor region" that influences their taste preferences and battle style. Some prefer sweet dishes, while others crave something bitter or spicy. By mastering a variety of cooking minigames and carefully crafting meals to match each adventurer's palate, players can boost their strength, unlock new cards for their deck, and prepare themselves for the battles ahead. The better the meal, the more effective the Caretakers become in combat against the monstrous threats.</p><p>After every expedition, the action continues in the form of a puppet show that reenacts the Caretakers' adventures. These turn-based battle sequences require tactical thinking and showcase the impact of the meals prepared earlier. From there, the Caretaker brings back the spoils of victory, which Panko can use for future meals.</p><p>Players can wishlist the game or register for updates on the <a href="https://www.beastro.game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of other weapon changes, Battlefield Studios said the team is making "targeted adjustments to deliver a more consistent and rewarding gunplay experience." This will include a "general pass on recoil and tap-fire characteristics" for every weapon in the game. Other changes are being made to encourage "more controlled tap-firing and burst-firing, rewarding precision and weapon mastery," the studio said.</p><p>What's more, Battlefield Studios said it's aware of the feedback around time-to-kill rates, but the company isn't committed to making any changes just yet. "We will share an update if definitive changes are made in these areas," the studio said.</p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta was the <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1958544684134912042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest beta in Battlefield's history in terms of players</a>.
