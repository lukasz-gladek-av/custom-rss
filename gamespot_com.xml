                <p>Baby mobs have been around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> for a while, but these creatures are getting an adorable makeover for a future update. Mojang Studios has shared a first look at its upcoming baby mob remasters, which is currently being tested. When the update is finished, the dev team promises that the wolf pups, kittens, piglets, calves, baby chickens, baby ocelots, lambs, and baby rabbits will be "even chunkier, floofier, and more charming than ever before."</p><p>In the accompanying announcement video, game director Agnes Larsson explains that previous baby mobs were just scaled down versions of the adult creatures. This update is giving the baby animals their own specific designs and completely new sound recordings pulled from real animals.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaLDBHodmGs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FaLDBHodmGs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Larsen went on to explain a more subtle touch that gives the baby mobs' faces a more youthful appearance.</p><p>"Typically mobs in Minecraft have two-pixel eyes," said Larsen. "But now baby mobs have just one which creates a new vibe for them, which is just adorable."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/first-features-minecraft-cutest-drop-yet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devs also revealed</a> that players will be able to name their baby mobs with craftable labels using paper and any metal nugget. Players can preview the changes in Java snapshot and the Bedrock beta preview now.</p><p>In December, Mojang Studios released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-lets-players-ride-into-combat/1100-6536825/" data-ref-id="1100-6536825">the Mounts of Mayhem update</a>, which lets players ride animals into combat situations among other changes.

                <p>If you spend any time on social media, whether that be Bluesky or X, you may have seen some reports going around that Microsoft is preparing to cut tens of thousands of jobs amidst the rising costs of artificial intelligence. Whether true or not, Microsoft's lead communications officer has come forward to refute the claims.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report on the site TipRanks</a> said that Microsoft is "considering massive layoffs" this month, with the plan to cut anywhere between 11,000 and 22,000 jobs on the Azure Cloud, Xbox, and global sales teams. After circulating on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/whatlayoff.com/post/3mbtiwjmgtz2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/2008806488190709970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> for a while, Windows Central editor Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2008865530749571146" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purported that the news was "false"</a> on Xbox's side of things. Not long after this, Microsoft CCO Frank X. Shaw--who's been at the company for nearly 17 years, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fxshaw/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to his LinkedIn</a>--chimed in to dismiss the report as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100 percent made up / speculative / wrong.</p>  — Frank X. Shaw (@fxshaw) <a href="https://twitter.com/fxshaw/status/2008908227589624203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>There's a lot of skepticism under both Corden and Shaw's posts. However, Shaw has responded to a lot of the commentary, saying that he, too, "<a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/2008942834754441434" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eagerly awaits</a>" the news that he claims is wrong.</p><p>None of this is to say that layoffs at Microsoft may not happen in some future. The company has gone through a myriad of job cuts recently. This just underscores that you can't believe everything you read online, as some--if not most--of it is engagement bait.</p><p>That said, Microsoft has cut jobs at the company recently. In early July 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">laid off roughly 9,000 employees</a>, with Xbox head Phil Spencer calling the cuts "necessary" for the company's enduring success. As a result of these cuts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6726">several games were canceled and studios were closed</a> so that the company could "increase agility and effectiveness," Spencer said at the time. Despite those layoffs, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">Microsoft still reached a valuation of $4 trillion</a> in late July 2025.</p>

                <p>MachineGames is working on a third new Wolfenstein game to follow 2014's Wolfenstein: The New Order and 2017's Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. This is according to reports from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wolfenstein-3-in-development-machinegames-bethesda-2000657758" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, both of which said the game is happening but had no other details to share.</p><p>This would be the first new Wolfenstein game since Wolfenstein: Youngblood and the VR game Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, both of which were released in 2019.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-dev-hopes-to-return-to-the-franchise/1100-6534556/" data-ref-id="1100-6534556">In September 2025</a>, MachineGames creative director Axel Torvenius said he wanted to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," Torvenius said in a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p>If MachineGames is indeed working on a third Wolfenstein game in its trilogy, it could be announced at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">this month's Xbox Developer Direct </a>or the expected Xbox summer showcase, though these are both just guesses.</p><p>Beyond a possible new Wolfenstein game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Prime Video is producing a live-action Wolfenstein TV series</a>. It's still early days, though, and there is no word on any specifics about the show.</p><p>The Wolfenstein titles take place in an alternate timeline where Germany won World War II after they discovered advanced technology. The Wolfenstein video game series has been around since 1981, and 1992's Wolfenstein 3D from developer Id Software is credited as one of the key games that helped popularize first-person shooters in the '90s.</p>

                <p>If you're a fan of visiting multiple maps for a single quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, boy do we have some objectives for you. For the Eyes in the Sky quest, you'll be tasked with heading to three different maps to place LiDAR Scanners, and getting all of them done is going to take a bit of skill, luck, and a zipline. Let's talk about it.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete any portion of Eyes in the Sky, so you can go in with a free loadout for the Dam Battlegrounds and Spaceport objectives. However, you will need a zipline to reach the necessary spot on Buried City, so you may want to suit up for that one.</p><p>When you're ready to tackle this quest, follow the guide below.</p><h2 id="On_Dam_Battlegrounds__install_a_LiDAR_Scanner_at_the_top_of_the_Control_Tower">On Dam Battlegrounds, install a LiDAR Scanner at the top of the Control Tower</h2><p>The first LiDAR Scanner you need to install is likely to be the most dangerous of them all. To complete this objective, you'll need to visit the high-traffic and PVP-centric Control Tower POI in the middle of the Dam Battlegrounds map.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134" data-ratio="0.56484641638225" data-width="2344" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631134"></a><figcaption>Control Tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631134-arcraiders_20260106205723.jpg"></figure><p>This POI is frequently riddled with PVPers and folks trying to use their keys to open doors inside the building. With that in mind, don't be surprised if you've got to take out a few folks before you get to where you're going.</p><p>There are multiple entrances into this POI, but one of the safest options is to approach this building from the south.

Take the one that heads upward, but before you take it, <strong>look straight up and shoot any turrets that may be along the walls above you</strong>, as they'll rip you to shreds if you take the zipline up before they're killed.</p><p>If someone's been through here already, you may not see any turrets. This can be a good or bad thing. Since there's a very popular key room on the floor above you, it's possible someone has already gone up and entered that room, and they'll often set traps at the top of the zipline to alert them of any potential threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631140"></a><figcaption>Taking the zipline up can be dangerous, as there may be traps or other raiders waiting at the top.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631140-arcraiders_20260106211758.jpg"></figure><p>If you go up and set off any traps, it's a good idea to immediately call out that you're friendly and just questing to calm other raiders' nerves. But in cases where the person is aggressive, you may have to fight back. In the worst case scenario, you'll die and have to load back in to try again--but the best case scenario is that you eliminate someone and get some sweet loot for it. </p><p>However this situation plays out, the key room on the right in the linear corridor isn't your main goal. Instead, you'll want to make your way through the corridor until you reach another breachable door at the top of some stairs.

This quest asks you to go to Buried City, Dam Battlegrounds, and Spaceport to search for specific things, and rounding up the correct spots to visit can be a challenge if you're not familiar with the maps yet. That's alright, though--that's where we come in.</p><p>Keep in mind that, since you won't need to extract with any items to complete any steps in What We Left Behind, you can comfortably head in with a free loadout to avoid risking any of your good loot. But, of course, you're also welcome to bring your best stuff if you'd rather be ready for a fight.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, here's how to complete each step of What We Left Behind.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</a></li><li><a href="#On_Dam_Battlegrounds__search_for_anything_significant_in_the_South_Swamp_Outpost">On Dam Battlegrounds, search for anything significant in the South Swamp Outpost</a></li><li><a href="#On_Spaceport__search_for_anything_significant_in_Bilguun_s_Hideout__next_to_the_Container_Storage">On Spaceport, search for anything significant in Bilguun's Hideout, next to the Container Storage</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="On_Buried_City__search_2_containers_in_the_Raider_Camp_beneath_the_Parking_Garage">On Buried City, search 2 containers in the Raider Camp beneath the Parking Garage</h2><p>The first part of the quest sends you to the Parking Garage on the northwestern side of Buried City.

                <p>It's the start of a new year, and you might be tempted to give your PS5 console a makeover. Fortunately, Sony has a new selection of limited-edition PS5 console covers and DualSense controllers on the way, all sporting vivid neon colors. The Hyerpop Collection PS5 console covers will be a PS Direct Store exclusive priced at $75, while the DualSense controllers will cost $85 each. Preorders will open on January 16 ahead of their March 12 launch.</p><p>Like the console covers, the DualSense controllers will be available in three distinct colorways. Techno Red is a loud, vibrant option that fades to a glossy black at the top. First released in November 2020, the DualSense controller features adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a Create Button for when you want to quickly grab in-game screenshots and video clips. Remix Green also pops nicely on the DualSense controller, with this particular shade being an instant attention-grabber. While it's also a bright color, Rhythm Blue is a touch softer than the two options above it. The blue tones give the DualSense controller a <em>slightly </em>subdued and calmer effect.</p><div title="6537254 -- Hyperpop Collection Console Covers" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5388"

                <p>In December 2025, the developers at Ubisoft Halifax--the studio behind the mobile game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-rebellion/" data-ref-id="5000-466062">Assassin's Creed Rebellion</a>--successfully voted to unionize and join the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada. Now, less than a month later, Ubisoft is shutting down Ubisoft Halifax and laying off 70 people.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, Ubisoft has denied that the closure of the studio has anything to do with the employees' unionization efforts. The publisher also stated through a spokesperson that the decision to close Ubisoft Halifax had already been made before the union vote was taken.</p><p>"Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," Ubisoft's spokesperson said in a statement to VGC. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio ... 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance."</p><p>Late last year, Ubisoft came under fire for asking employees to accept "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-roasted-for-asking-devs-to-accept-voluntary-career-transition/1100-6535640/" data-ref-id="1100-6535640">voluntary career transition</a>," or in other words, an early layoff. Assassin's Creed executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left the company after nearly two decades</a>, and he has since stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-says-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/1100-6535519/" data-ref-id="1100-6535519">it wasn't his choice to leave</a>.</p><p>In November, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-posts-strong-first-half-growth-and-teases-major-creative-shake-up-coming-in-2026/1100-6536414/" data-ref-id="1100-6536414">Ubisoft told investors</a> that its earnings in Q2 of its fiscal year were up 39% year-over-year. The company also stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-exceeded-expectations-for-ubisoft-mirage-hits-10-million-players/1100-6536470/" data-ref-id="1100-6536470">the Assassin's Creed franchise exceeded its expectations</a>. That apparently wasn't enough to prevent any further job losses at its partner studios.</p>

Call of Duty's paid event passes usually cost $10. The Ghoul and Maximus are available to unlock in the paid event pass, while the vault dweller skins are earned in the free pass. Lucy's operator skin is available as a shop bundle, and Call of Duty's operator bundles are typically around $20 each.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty will feature limited-time game modes themed around the Fallout series. Ghoul Infection is a limited-time multiplayer mode that puts a Fallout spin on Call of Duty's Infection game mode. Project RADs is a ghoul-themed Zombies mode, and Warzone features Power-Armor Royale, which lets players step into Fallout's power armor and wield miniguns in battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's popular Nuketown map is also getting a makeover for the big event. This gives a Fallout-themed design to the map, with the mannequins dressed up in blue vault suits.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out all the details for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date-and-details/1100-6537221/">Season 1 Reloaded in Black Ops 7 and Warzone</a>, including more weapons, multiplayer maps, and a mystery to solve in Warzone.</p>
