                <p>As pleasant as it might be for us if the world were exclusively full of nice people, that's not necessarily the right formula for an entertaining life sim video game. If all the characters in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> only gave each other compliments, it would get boring immediately--fortunately, that's not what InZoi is like at all. Here's a full explainer of how InZoi karma works.</p><h2 id="InZoi_karma_explained">InZoi karma explained</h2><p dir="ltr">In InZoi, you can be a good Zoi or a bad Zoi, and your behavior is reflected by your karma level. InZoi's karma is not something that has a direct parallel in The Sims 4--the closest mechanic would be its reputation system, but that's based on what other characters think of you, and this karma system is more like the game's judgment of your behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">With that being the case, it's best to think of InZoi's karma as akin to a dark side/light side meter in a Star Wars game, or the renegade/paragon system from Mass Effect. The more your karma slides one way or the other, the more options you'll have to do things that correspond with your alignment. If you have bad karma, you'll unlock new methods for being a jerk, like picking fights and shoving people to the ground for no reason. You'll even be able to start committing crimes, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-rob-an-atm-in-inzoi/1100-6530448/" data-ref-id="1100-6530448">robbing ATMs</a>. You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-out-of-jail-in-inzoi/1100-6530449/" data-ref-id="1100-6530449">go to jail for that kind of thing</a>, though, so be careful.</p><p dir="ltr">On the flip side of that, having good karma will unlock a bunch of new friendly and encouraging interactions that will get other Zois to like you more.</p><p dir="ltr">While there's not any sort of immediate inherent consequence to having bad karma--it doesn't give you horns or anything like in Fable--there <em>is</em> a spiritual one. If your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-death-the-afterlife-and-ghosts-explained/1100-6530456/" data-ref-id="1100-6530456">Zoi has terrible karma when they die, they'll be forced to become a ghost</a> who roams around the world dealing with unfinished business. Unfortunately, the ghost mechanics haven't actually been added to the game yet, so we don't know how those will actually work.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_good_or_bad_karma_in_InZoi">How to get good or bad karma in InZoi</h2><p dir="ltr">So now you know what karma does, but we haven't discussed how you actually gain or lose it. In the abstract, obviously, the idea is mean-spirited  interactions with other Zois will make your karma worse, and nice interactions will make it better. But, more specifically, there is a section of the dialogue and interaction box in InZoi dedicated entirely to actions that will mess with your karma. It looks like this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526" data-ratio="0.56246759979264" data-width="1929" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467526"></a><figcaption>Choose interactions with the circular karma symbol if you want to increase or decrease your karma.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4467526-inzoikarmaactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That little circular icon on those options on the right side of the image is InZoi's mark for karma, with a <strong>blue circle marking a good karma action, and a red circle marking a bad karma action</strong>. To make your karma go up, do the blue actions as much as you can. To make your karma go down, do the red actions. It's exactly that simple.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two ways you can boost the process a bit, however. The first is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-inzoi-donuts-and-what-they-do/1100-6530400/" data-ref-id="1100-6530400">with donuts</a>. There are a pair of karma-focused donuts you can buy using the coins you earn for achieving your life ambitions, one which resets your karma to neutral, and one that gives you very bad karma. There's no donut for getting good karma, though--you'll have to do that the hard way.</p><p dir="ltr">The second boost you can give your karma gains is in the city management menu, which has sliders that allow you to globally increase, or decrease, the rate at which all Zois' karma goes up and down. If you set that slider to the fast end, you can have your karma maxed out (or min'd out) in minutes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Is_there_any_benefit_to_having_neutral_karma_in_InZoi_">Is there any benefit to having neutral karma in InZoi?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not that I can tell, but as you can tell by the ghost thing, this system isn't all fully fleshed out yet. It's likely that neutral options will be added in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">For much more on your new life in Krafton's life sim, don't miss our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-guides-hub/1100-6530475/" data-ref-id="1100-6530475">InZoi guides hub</a>.</p>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> does <em>many</em> things that The Sims does not, some aspects of Krafton's new Early Access life sim are very similar to features we've seen The Sims 4. One of these is InZoi's Ambitions system, which is essentially identical to The Sims' Aspirations. You choose an ambition, like becoming an expert artist, and then you'll have to complete a series of related tasks that award a currency that will allow you to buy upgrades. But while these systems <em>look</em> the same, in execution they actually function very differently. Here's what to know about InZoi Donuts and hoe to get more of them.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#InZoi_donuts_explained">InZoi donuts explained</a></li><li><a href="#InZoi_donut_list">InZoi donut list</a><ul><li><a href="#Donuts_that_fill_a_need_gauge">Donuts that fill a need gauge</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_add__5_to_any_emotional_state_for_6_hours">Donuts that add +5 to any emotional state for 6 hours</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_add__30_to_any_emotional_state_for_12_hours">Donuts that add +30 to any emotional state for 12 hours</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_cause_individual_need_gauges_to_deplete_at_1_5_the_normal_rate_for_two_days">Donuts that cause individual need gauges to deplete at 1/5 the normal rate for two days</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_prevent_individual_need_gauges_from_depleting_at_all_for_one_day">Donuts that prevent individual need gauges from depleting at all for one day</a></li><li><a href="#Donuts_that_completely_empty_an_individual_need_gauge">Donuts that completely empty an individual need gauge</a></li><li><a href="#Increase_individual_skill_gains_by_30__for_one_day">Increase individual skill gains by 30% for one day</a></li><li><a href="#Other_donuts">Other donuts</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="InZoi_donuts_explained">InZoi donuts explained</h2><p dir="ltr">If you've spent time with The Sims 4 lately, InZoi's Ambitions will be very familiar. When you're creating your Zois, you pick an Ambition for each of them, and each Ambition includes three waves of tasks. If you pick the Pro Musician Ambition, you'll start by buying an instrument and playing it three times; wave two requires you to play drums ten times, and play any instrument while feeling sentimental; and wave three requires you to max out your instrument skill (all instruments fall under this one skill) and play guitar 20 times.</p><p dir="ltr">Each wave of tasks that you complete will award you with NyanCoins, with each successive wave of tasks giving more than the previous wave. And then you'll spend those NyanCoins on donuts, which you can purchase from the "Meow Coins" menu on your Zoi card. But these aren't just any donuts--these donuts come with a timed buff.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a bunch of different donuts with many different buffs. There's one that allows you to know everything about anyone you meet within the next hour. There are donuts that will prevent one of your needs from depleting for an entire day. And there are donuts that will boost your skill gains for a day as well. Unlike the aspiration rewards in The Sims, however, all of the boosts you will get from the donuts are temporary, so there's no way to, for example, permanently free yourself from the need to sleep like some dystopian military experiment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466051" data-ratio="0.56260720411664" data-width="1749" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466051"></a><figcaption>Buying donuts can make your Zoi's life a lot easier.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4466051-20250326113054_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most useful donuts may be the ones that imbue you with an emotion--it's much more difficult to complete your ambitions without them. For example, the music ambition requires you to play music while sentimental, and there's a donut that will make you sentimental for six hours. Without the donut, you might simply have to wait until you get the emotion you need naturally, and that might never happen when you actually need it. Fortunately, the emotion donuts are the cheapest available, at only 30 NyanCoins each.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambitions are not the only way to get NyanCoins, though they are by far the fastest method because they reward quite a lot if you actually finish all three stages of an Ambition. But you can also earn small amounts through more mundane methods, by completing your Zoi's wants (these are random impulses like "I want to catch a fish and eat it"), and by completing your work objectives at your job.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="InZoi_donut_list">InZoi donut list</h2><p dir="ltr">While you can pull up the list of donuts you can buy at any time, the tooltips on them frequently leave out key details, like how long the donut's effects will last, or even that they're temporary at all. Fortunately for you, you're in the right place to find out more, because below you'll find the full list of donuts as well as more detailed descriptions of what they do than you'll get from InZoi itself before you buy one, along with the price you'll pay in NyanCoins for them. If the effect is timed, the timer begins the instant you buy the donut.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Donuts_that_fill_a_need_gauge">Donuts that fill a need gauge</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sleep-Filling Donut - 80</li><li dir="ltr">Hunger-Filling Donut -
