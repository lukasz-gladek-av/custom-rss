                <p>Square Enix, in partnership with Lightspeed Studios, has officially announced Final Fantasy XIV Mobile, a mobile adaptation of the popular MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/">Final Fantasy XIV Online</a>. The game will first launch in China, with a global release planned shortly afterward.</p><p>The mobile version of the game was unveiled in a new trailer, and aims to bring the expansive world of Eorzea to players on smartphones and tablets, offering a mobile-friendly experience that preserves the key elements of the original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1vk2A--ZbY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n1vk2A--ZbY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to a press release announcing the game, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will retain many of the features that have made the original game a success, including the story-driven content and combat, along with non-combat systems like crafting, gathering, and mini-games. The mobile version will also feature low-pressure minigames such as fishing, Chocobo racing, and the Triple Triad card game.</p><p>Naoki Yoshida, the producer and director of Final Fantasy XIV, noted that the mobile version will serve as a "sister" to the original game, recreating the story and combat mechanics on mobile devices.</p><p>"It has been 11 years since FFXIV 2.0: A Realm Reborn launched, and this new mobile game will be a sister to FFXIV, aiming to recreate the grandeur of the original's story and combat mechanics on mobile devices," Yoshida explained. "Non-combat features, such as Disciples of the Land and Hand, will also be faithfully implemented and we look forward to growing alongside the passionate FFXIV community."</p><p>To ensure a high-quality experience on mobile, Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will feature visuals optimized for smaller screens, while retaining the detailed art and design that characterizes the original game. Square Enix says the mobile game will include dynamic weather systems with over 600 weather patterns, and the visuals will be adapted to maintain the level of detail found in the original FFXIV, from character models to environmental designs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402356" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402356"></a><figcaption>FFXIV Mobile includes a number of features found in the non-mobile version of the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4402356-ff14.jpg"></figure><p>The social aspects of Final Fantasy XIV will also be preserved in the mobile version. The game will offer a low-pressure environment for players to interact with others, focusing on meaningful, voluntary engagements. Whether it's joining a party for a dungeon or interacting with other players during casual activities, FFXIV Mobile aims to replicate the community-driven experience of the original game.</p><p>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile will soon be available for playtesting in China, with a global launch scheduled for a later date, which Square Enix has not yet shared publicly. Players can pre-register for the game on the <a href="http://www.ffxivmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a> and receive updates through various social media channels, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/towers-of-aghasba/" data-ref-id="5000-589437">Towers of Aghasba</a> launches today on PC and PS5 as an early access game. Though that means the game isn't complete yet, it very quickly wears its Zelda inspiraitons on its sleeve thanks to the way you explore its fantastical open world often with a glider, can climb any surface, manage your stamina, and fight enemies with weapons that degrade. It's also inspired by Ghibli movies and features a former Ghibli artist on the development team. But it uses those major touchstones to present its big idea: a survival-crafting game that operates <em>in reverse</em>.</p><p>Most games of this sort--tree-punchers, I affectionately call them--task players with tearing down a local ecosystem to convert flora and fauna into homes and meals, eventually wiping out the natural landscape in favor of something that may be beautiful in its own way, but definitely paves over the world that was once on display.</p><p>Towers of Aghasba <em>does </em>ask you to pick apart some local resources to improve your own conditions, like making tools from trees and stones early on, but it's all done in service of nature, as you restore a brownish, barren landscape to a lush, healthy world full of critters and immaculate natural landmarks. In that way, it's almost like Spore, too, as you bring life to what is essentially a blank slate when you arrive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j76LZRBEQ4I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j76LZRBEQ4I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If the typical survival-crafting gameplay loop has you ready for something different, you can check out Towers of Aghasba for yourself in the launch trailer or find it on PC and PS5 starting today.</p><p>As it's an early access game, the developers have already laid out a lengthy roadmap planned well into the future, so players jumping in now can come to expect these future updates. You can check out those updates below, which include features such as new regions to explore, photo mode, more quests and NPCs, and weather effects with which you'll need to contend. The game is currently planned to be in early access until at least sometime in 2026, and playing a game early often affords early adopters a chance to help shape it in ways big or small.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4402363"></a><figcaption>Towers of Aghasba roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4402363-unnamed%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p>Towers of Aghasba is available now on PC and PS5. </p>
