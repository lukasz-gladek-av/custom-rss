The 3v3 sports game is played by using both Joy-Cons in mouse mode to control the player's wheelchair, although shooting the ball requires using motion-control gestures.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, it's the sole first-party Switch 2 release to make extensive use of mouse controls, although it's not known if it will be possible to play the game with other control configurations. The upcoming Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition features a new mode called Jamboree TV that will feature new mouse-based minigames, while Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also include the option to play with mouse controls for aiming. As far as third-party games go, both Cyberpunk 2077 and Civilization 7 have mouse-control options.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more expensive first-party releases like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag x Drive is launching as a digital exclusive for $20. It is available to preorder from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/drag-x-drive-switch-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eShop</a>.</p>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has teased plans to add more content to Fallout 76 based on the Prime Video TV series. Creative director Jon Rush said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game studio and TV teams are in discussion "all the time," but it's too soon to say what specific content may be in the works.</p><p>"Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it's stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I'm not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another," Rush said.</p><p>While there may be opportunities for crossover content, Rush pointed out that Fallout 76's story is the furthest back in time for the series and the TV show is the furthest into the future. "So there's a lot of room where we don't necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories ,that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple," Rush said.</p><p>Fallout 76's Season 21 update launched in June, and the introduction of fishing was its biggest draw.
