                <p>Elden Ring Nightreign's newest patch, 1.01.2, is out now, and it's exclusively focused on bug fixes.</p><p>The new update fixes a bug that would prevent the Demon Merchant from appearing in some scenarios. It also addresses an issue where Libra, Creature of the Night, would "repeatedly perform some actions." Additionally, the patch fixes a problem that could cause stability issues with the game in the battle sequence against Adel, Baron of Night.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has hidden Mirror Mode in the Free Roam mode for Mario Kart World in a pretty awesome way. Players can flip the open world by driving into the stained-glass window of Princess Peach on her castle at the center of the map, though there is a catch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/">Mirror Mode must already be unlocked</a> through the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour Cups--on top of some other requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hides-mirror-mode-free-roam-behind-a-mario-64-easter-egg" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://x.com/Ninjinaut/status/1931248124208496810" rel="nofollow ">account on X called Ninjinaut</a> showcased the Mirror Mode Easter egg in Free Roam for Mario Kart World. The video sees Baby Rosalina jumping into the window, which is a direct callback to Super Mario 64's mechanic for accessing new worlds. The screen fades to white and then shows Princess Peach flipped. Baby Rosalina then shoots out of the window, with the open world now in Mirror Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that Free Roam is only playable in single-player, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-missing-one-feature-people-really-wanted/1100-6532133/">as people realized co-op was missing for the mode</a> when Mario Kart World launched last week alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.

                <p>It's been five years since Naughty Dog released The Last of Us: Part 2, and with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunners-tease-season-3s-new-direction/1100-6531811/" data-ref-id="1100-6531811">Season 3 of the HBO series in the works</a>, the anticipation and clamoring for a Part 3 has never been higher. However, showrunner Craig Mazin admittedly knows just a hint of the story for the potential game, but isn't sure if it'll ever happen.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__flfZc9JCc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">Season 2</a> of The Last of Us, Mazin said game creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann told him some ideas he had for a Part 3, but would be okay if the game never came into fruition.</p><p>"I am familiar with some concepts that Neil has kicked around for a potential third game. I don't know if he's zeroed in on one of them. I don't know what will happen there," he explains, adding that although he'd like Part 3 to happen, he also thinks maybe less is more. "Sometimes I think, maybe you should just be happy. Don't be sad it's over--be happy that it happened at all! I think Naughty Dog is an incredible game studio. They make beautiful art, and their ability to convey what we can do in television through animation is pretty remarkable."</p><p>He continued with how he could be selfish and beg Druckmann to make Part 3, but feels as though he would rob the studio of other potentially great games it could make instead.</p><p>"It's not like what I want is going to matter. They will do what they do, and all I know is that I'll be there on day one to play Intergalactic. If there's another Uncharted, I'll play it. If there's another Last of Us, I'll play it."</p><p dir="ltr">The most recent comments about The Last of Us: Part 3 from Druckmann himself said he's not ruling it out, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-could-happen-if-the-stars-align-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6530741/">he's not confirming it either.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog is currently working on multiple games. Alongside Intergalactic, a mystery second game is in development.</p>
