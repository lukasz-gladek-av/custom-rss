                <p>Microsoft has said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">committed</a> to bringing Call of Duty to Nintendo Switch, and it could be coming as soon as next year. Reporter Jez Corden <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003171421879460027" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> "the first CoD Switch version is nearly done."</p><p>He added that the game, whatever it is, will launch "in a few months."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2003179459936145530" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Corden said the release may not be "close" but it's "on the way" for a 2026 release. He added that the game is "hitting milestones," which is a reference to how a game is proceeding through development.</p><p>It remains to be seen if the reported Call of Duty game for Switch is a port of an existing Call of Duty game, like Black Ops 7 or Warzone, or a new title.</p><p>In 2022, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-call-of-duty-on-switch-would-definitely-require-some-work-phil-spencer-says/1100-6509798/" data-ref-id="1100-6509798">"definitely" work to be done</a> to get Call of Duty running on Switch. Since then, Nintendo has released the more powerful Switch 2.</p><p>In 2023, amid the FTC vs. Microsoft court case, Microsoft said it had <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1629180356359495680" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signed</a> a "binding 10-year legal agreement to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo players." The statement said Microsoft would launch Call of Duty on Nintendo platforms "the same day as Xbox, with full features and content parity."</p><p>Then in June 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/" data-ref-id="1100-6532276">a spokesperson for Activision said</a>, "We're committed to getting the [Call of Duty] franchise on Switch," adding that both Microsoft and Activision were working on making it happen. The companies never set any expectations for a release window, however.</p><p>If a Call of Duty game is indeed coming to Switch, one possible venue for its announcement could be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-confirmed-for-january-2026-but-it-wont-have-everything/1100-6536932/" data-ref-id="1100-6536932">January 2026 Xbox Developer Direct. </a></p><p>Activision has skipped Nintendo platforms for Call of Duty for more than a decade, as the last Call of Duty release on a Nintendo platform was a port of Call of Duty: Ghosts for Wii U in 2013. Call of Duty has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-a-long-strange-history-on-nintendo-consoles/1100-6509800/" data-ref-id="1100-6509800">long, strange history on Nintendo platforms</a>.</p><p>Since Microsoft acquired Activision and the Call of Duty series, the company has continued to release new Call of Duty games on PlayStation day-and-date with the Xbox and PC versions. </p><p>GameSpot has contacted Activision in an attempt to get more details on Call of Duty's future on Switch.</p>

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was one of 2025's biggest breakout hits, and the game's commercial success has afforded developer Sandfall Interactive the opportunity to scale up for its next project. However, the company is not going to do that--and for what sounds like a good reason.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://newsletter.smartbrief.com/servlet/encodeServlet?issueid=99B77395-C1C6-4F52-AF3E-415FC009F6B1&amp;sid=7C18806E-AF5A-4F78-A29B-F02783429FF1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge</a>, studio boss Guillaume Broche said he does not feel tempted to grow the company in the wake of the success of Expedition 33, which was the studio's debut title. Why not? He said (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-sandfall-says-expansion-isnt-tempting" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GI.biz</a>), "I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative."</p>

<p>"It's the best way to be the best version of yourself. We could scale up now we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves," he said. "We love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."</p><p>He went on to say that his philosophy is to "adapt the game to the team, and not the other way around." He said Sandfall's ambition with Expedition 33 was to make a game its developers wanted to play.</p><p>"It's making a game that you want to play. It's contradictory, but [try to] not care too much about the players, because if you care about your game, it means you care about the players ultimately," he said. "The best way for me to care about people is to make something that is sincere. If it feels human, [even] if there are little flaws here and there, it's forgivable. It just has to have a strong soul and identity."</p><p>Expedition 33 sold more than 5 million copies and won numerous awards. This included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record nine wins at The Game Awards</a>, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">overall Game of the Year. </a></p><p>The game was recently embroiled in controversy, as The Indie Game Awards <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/" data-ref-id="1100-6537129">revoked its Game of the Year win due to AI concerns.</a> The game also courted some controversy over its designation as an "independent" game. Its success also inspired people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-was-under-10-million-report/1100-6536874/" data-ref-id="1100-6536874">see hope for the future when it comes to lower-budget games</a> finding success in a market dominated by many expensive sequels.</p><p>Sandfall has not said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">what it will make next</a>, but it will have very big shoes to fill given the immense critical and commercial success of Expedition 33.

                <p>Vince Zampella, the co-founder of Infinity Ward and one of the leading figures behind the first Call of Duty game, has passed away. Zampella was reportedly in a single-car accident on Sunday, December 21 in the San Gabriel Mountains when the vehicle went off the road and hit a concrete barrier.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/?utm_medium=share&amp;_branch_referrer=H4sIAAAAAAAAA8soKSkottLXz0tKzskvTsxLT81JLdZLLCjQy8nMy9avTMq39M32KsuKSrKvK0pNSy0qysxLj08qyi8vTi2ydcsEiuVXAADMQ28FRQAAAA%3D%3D&amp;_branch_match_id=1531733479725395701" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC4 Los Angeles</a>, the driver of the vehicle perished in a car fire while the passenger was ejected and died at the hospital. The report didn't share any further specifics about the incident.</p><p>Zampella got his start in the video game industry in the late '90s with stints at GameTek, Atari, Interactive Media/Ripcord Games, and SegaSoft. In 1999, he joined 2015 Inc and became the lead designer of the third Medal of Honor game, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, which was published by EA.</p><p>Following a dispute with EA, Zampella, Grant Collier, and Jason West co-founded Infinity Ward and partnered with Activision before launching the Call of Duty franchise in 2003. "The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," said Zampella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-exists-because-ea-were-dicks-says-vince-zampella/1100-6535420/" data-ref-id="1100-6535420">during a recent interview</a>.</p><p>Zampella and West remained at Activision until 2010 when they were fired by the company over alleged insubordination. The pair subsequently filed a lawsuit against Activision that was settled out of court for undisclosed terms. They went on to co-founded Respawn Entertainment, which released titles including Apex Legends, Titanfall, and the Star Wars Jedi games. Respawn was ultimately purchased by EA.</p><p>EA put Zampella in charge of DICE in 2020 with a mandate to revitalize the Battlefield franchise. Those efforts paid off earlier this year when Battlefield 6 was released to great acclaim and higher-then expected sales numbers.</p><p>Zampella had a major impact on the games industry, with many sharing memories of him on social media. You can find a selection of those tributes below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/2003194764586598408" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Vince was awesome.

                <p>2K Sports has confirmed that WWE 2K24 will be delisted as of January 31, 2026, with servers shutting down on March 31, 2026.

The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.</p><p>All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.</p><p>WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years.

                <p>If you find yourself with a shiny new Meta Quest headset during the holidays, be sure to check out the new Winter 2025 Edition of Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Create+Your+Own+VR+Games+Bundle+For+Less+Than+%243+Per+Game&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-22+07%3A28%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-22+11%3A30%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6537134&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-quest-vr-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-quest-vr-bundle%2F1100-6537134%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle</a> deal. Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. <strong>Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each.</strong> If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value.</p><p>As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design.</p><p>For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games.</p><p>The bundle also offers creative VR experiences like SuchArt and SculptrVR. The former has you whipping up colorful creations in your studio as you earn cash to upgrade your gear, while the latter lets you try your hand at sculpting (which, thanks to its innovative tools, is much easier than the real thing).</p><p>Plenty of other great games are eligible for the Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle, so be sure to check out the full list below. All of the VR games purchased in this bundle are delivered as official codes that can be redeemed via the Meta Quest launcher.</p><p>Along with the games, the deal includes a 5%-off coupon code usable on a future Fanatical purchase.
