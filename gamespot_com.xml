                <p>It's rare for Epic Games to make a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Icon skin for a content creator who isn't specifically focused on Fortnite, but it <em>does</em> happen occasionally. And it looks like another influencer is joining that club this week, as Kai Cenat teased on Sunday.</p><p>As the tweet indicates, Cenat is going to reveal the new skin on Monday night at 8:30 PM PT / 11:30 PM ET, and the announcement should happen live on Twitch, since that's usually how they do these things. There will probably be a tournament in the next few days where players can earn the skin for free, before it releases in the item shop later in the week.</p><p>Fortnite typically awards Icon skins--that being a skin based on a real human being, rather than a fictional character--either to streamers who have a specific focus on Fortnite, or celebrities who are much more broadly famous, like Mariah Carey, Shaquille O'Neal, Sabrina Carpenter, and other folks like that.</p><p>Cenat, however, is Fortnite's third Icon Skin, after Mr. Beast and Khaby Lame, that falls in between those two categories--content creators who are famous enough to get a skin despite not being known for playing Fortnite. Epic doesn't do this very often. The Mr. Beast skins were released in December 2022, and Khaby Lame was on the Chapter 4 Season 4 battle pass two years ago. Cenat will be the first such Icon skin to hit Fortnite since Khaby Lame.</p>

                <p>It was the Pokemon World Championships over the weekend, and with that means plenty of announcements. If you're a bit of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> aficionado, then you'll probably be excited to hear that Mega Evolution will be coming to the mobile card-collecting game later this fall. The Pokemon Company shared a trailer announcing the news, where it also showed off three Mega Pokemon cards that will be available to pull whenever the set drops.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is the "ever-fluffy" Mega Altaria. This one is a psychic-type card with 190HP, and it has just one move, Mega Harmony, which does a minimum of 40 damage, and increases by 30 points for every benched Pokemon you have.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the "ghastly" Mega Gyarados, a water-type card with 210HP, and again a singular move, Mega Blaster. This move deals 140 damage, and your opponent has to discard the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, there's Mega Blaziken, a fire-type card which also has 210HP, and uses the move Mega Burning, which deals 120 damage. You can also discard one fire energy card from it to burn your opponent's active Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Mega Pokemon also comes with a Mega Evolution EX rule, which states that when your Mega Evolved Pokemon card is knocked out, your opponent gets three points.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no word on when the Mega Evolution season will kick off outside of this fall, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also announced during this year's Pokemon Worlds that next year's championships <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-will-be-the-main-vgc-game-at-the-pokemon-world-championships-in-2026/1100-6534029/">will use the upcoming Pokemon Champions instead of any of the main series games</a>. As well as that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/" data-ref-id="1100-6534031">getting a new mode that sees four players battling each other at the same time</a>.</p>
