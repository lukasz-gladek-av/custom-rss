The outage has been fixed, and other measures are being taken to combat the cheating. This includes "aggressive targeting of suspicious accounts" and accelerating the replay investigations to review suspicious players.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranked Play is a competitive ladder that closely follows the official rules, maps, and game modes used by the Call of Duty League.

                <p>Those who have been playing Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl on Xbox have been experiencing some strange issues on their controllers, but the developer is working on a fix right now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/we-are-working-on-this-issue-already-stalker-2-has-a-huge-game-breaking-problem-on-xbox-and-gsc-game-world-confirms-that-its-working-on-a-fix" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Stalker 2 sets the controller's gamepad deadzones to zero on Xbox. As a result, this means that even the slightest nudge on the controller's stick will move the player while being in the game.</p><p>Developer GSC World has confirmed that it is <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859624851624890454" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already working on the issue</a>, but there's no announced timeline on when an update will arrive.

It's an admirable achievement, especially given that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/documentary-shows-stalker-2-is-an-element-of-resistance-amid-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/1100-6526873/" data-ref-id="1100-6526873">Ukrainian studio has had to deal with the ongoing Russian invasion</a>.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review-in-the-zone/1900-6418320/" data-ref-id="1900-6418320">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl review</a>, we said, "Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is rough around the edges, but its propensity for creating emergent moments in a deadly and alluring world makes this trip back to the Zone a fraught and compelling experience."</p>
