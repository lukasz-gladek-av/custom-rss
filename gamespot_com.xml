It's still below Siege's all-time peak of 201,933 achieved on May 17, 2024, but it's an impressive gain all the same as people returned to Siege or tried it for the first time to check out the Siege X update and all of its new features and functionality.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Siege is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top five best-selling Steam games</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">inside the top 10 most-played games.</a> Steam shares this data publicly, but Microsoft and Sony do not share similar sales or engagement data for the Xbox and PlayStation stores.</p><p>The Siege X update gives the game a makeover, of sorts, with better-looking graphics and improved sound. There is also brand-new 6v6 mode, Dual Front, among numerous other updates and improvements.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege originally launched in 2015 and has been steadily supported and evolved over time with consistent updates.

                <p>Epic Games wants to enhance Fortnite's appeal in Korea and announced multiple collaborations, including a new skin for South Korean soccer star Son Heung-min in Fortnite. Heung-min was also added to PUBG Battlegrounds a few years ago and featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-25/">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p><p>The Son Heung-min bundle will be released in the game store and includes his official uniform, the Forward Edge accessory that changes style according to time, the Goal Getter wrapping sheet with a soccer motif, and his iconic Snap Ceremony emote. All are on sale for a limited time from June 21-28.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4511894-sdic4nzodnffvgkheb6i6k6khi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511894" data-ratio="0.5609375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4511894-sdic4nzodnffvgkheb6i6k6khi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511894"></a><figcaption>Son Heung-Min in Fortnite</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4511894-sdic4nzodnffvgkheb6i6k6khi.jpg"></figure><p>In addition to Heung-min, Fortnite's music content has also been enhanced. Songs from BTS members Jungkook and Jimin, along with groups ENHYPEN, and ILLIT have been added as rhythm game content for Fortnite Festival.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://biz.chosun.com/en/en-it/2025/06/11/F42VJ5NSJFHWVL324MKGVUSG5U/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ChosunBiz</a>, Epic's senior design director Eric Williamson commented on how Fortnite has been evolving to more than just a game. "K-pop is a powerful cultural asset that connects global fandoms. Fortnite is evolving into a digital cultural hub that integrates music, fashion, and sports, and K-content serves as both an experimental field and a catalyst for this ecosystem," Williamson said. </p><p>Heung-min is far from the first gigantic sports star that have crossed over into Fortnite. Recent additions include baseball player Shohei Ohtani. Other notable athletes who have Fortnite skins include LeBron James, Neymar Jr, Harry Kane, Naomi Osaka, Patrick Mahomes, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shaq-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526822/" data-ref-id="1100-6526822">Shaquille O'Neal</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone will boast a larger world than the one in his farming simulator. But you don't have to take our word for it; Barone himself made this specific comparison for Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Barone stated that: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley." He would know, since in December, Barone noted he was creating Haunted Chocolatier similar to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," Barone said after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">reconfirming he resumed development on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of haunted chocolatier is larger than stardew valley</p>  — ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It seems like Barone is slowly but surely opening up more about his next game. Last month, the developer discussed how he wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">focus on mystery and whimsy with Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Barone sounds like he wants players to "let go of your desire to engineer the perfect chocolate" and instead just follow their intuition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/">Haunted Chocolatier was announced</a> in late 2021 and will see players taking over a chocolate factory. There is no release window for the RPG, with Barone saying earlier this year that he hopes it comes out in the next five years. That would take us through the rest of this decade. Afterward, Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">"might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</a></p>
