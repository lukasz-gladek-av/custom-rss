Now, Nintendo has set the damages it wants from the court, and it could leave Williams with a penalty for several million dollars.</p><p>Nintendo's legal complaint has been <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727/gov.uscourts.wawd.336727.25.0.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted online</a> (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:tf7tjgkrqwai2kbxpx2dbr6k/post/3m2f3jyovbe2a?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fmynintendonews.com%252F2025%252F10%252F05%252Fnintendo-is-requesting-4500000-in-damages-from-a-switch-piracy-reddit-mod%252F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Oatmeal Dome</a>), and it's asking for $4.5 million because it contends that Williams operated multiple Switch piracy sites, sold hardware hacks, and offered modified Switch consoles with pirated games. It also alleges that he refused to comply when the company sent him a cease-and-desist order. The complaint notes that Williams stopped acknowledging Nintendo's requests, which led to the lawsuit against him.</p><p>Last year, a separate report revealed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo played detective</a> to identify Williams as the person behind the Archbox Reddit account. Williams' allegedly shared personal details online that helped narrow the search, and he also sent in his Switch to Nintendo for repairs. Nintendo was granted a default judgement against Williams because he didn't plead his case in court before the scheduled deadlines. </p><p>In 2024, Nintendo's lawsuit successfully <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/" data-ref-id="1100-6521589">shut down Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and 3DS emulator Citra.

                <p>The follow-up to Yacht Club's indie hit Shovel Knight will have to wait a little longer, as the studio has announced that Mina the Hollower will be delayed out of its previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shovel-knight-devs-mina-the-hollower-launches-on-halloween-demo-out-now/1100-6532145/" data-ref-id="1100-6532145">Halloween release date</a>. While Yacht Club said this delay will be a short one, it isn't prepared to nail down an exact date just yet.</p><p>"This week, our team made a tough decision: we decided to delay Mina the Hollower," the team wrote on its <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/delay-extravaganza-ii-the-tail-continues/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>. "The entire crew has been working tirelessly day and night to finish development for release on October 31, but we’re just not quite there yet. This isn’t a major delay, it’s just a stretch of time to apply some final polish and balancing to make the game truly shine."</p><p>Though the delay is short, though, Yacht Club said it doesn't want to announce a new release date until it's submitted to all platforms. In the meantime, it's working on finalizing design, art, and sound, game balancing, localization, and testing. And eating cheese.</p><p>"Our goal is to make sure our development team has the time and resources to deliver an incredible adventure and we will be giving you just that," the studio said.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is Yacht Club's first original franchise after the breakout success of Shovel Knight in 2014. The studio has been busy in the meantime, though, creating loads of extra DLC campaigns for Shovel Knight, as well as developing and publishing spin-offs like Shovel Knight Showdown and Shovel Knight: Pocket Dungeon.</p><p>Mina the Hollower is inspired by the classic top-down Zelda games, with an art style that pays homage to that color palette as well. It stars a little mouse in a kingdom of animals, and as the name implies, she can burrow underground to solve puzzles and surprise enemies.</p>

The game's multiplayer includes four distinct classes, and it's important to understand the different abilities and gadgets that come paired with each one so you can pick the classes best suited to your playstyle and preferred game modes. In this guide, we break down all the classes in Battlefield 6, including their respective gadgets, signature weapons, traits, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</a></li><li><a href="#Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</a></li><li><a href="#Assault_class">Assault class</a><ul><li><a href="#Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Engineer_class">Engineer class</a><ul><li><a href="#Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Support_class">Support class</a><ul><li><a href="#Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Recon_class">Recon class</a><ul><li><a href="#Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</a></li><li><a href="#Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Battlefield_6_class_types">Battlefield 6 class types</h2><p dir="ltr">Starting with a simplified breakdown of the classes, they are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Assault:</strong> Frontline attackers who excel in close- to mid-range combat</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Engineer:</strong> Vehicle and destruction experts who can repair friendly vehicles and use a range of explosive equipment</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Support:</strong> A combat medic who assists teammates with healing, ammo resupplies, and quick revives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon:</strong> Experts in intelligence, infiltration, and deadly marksmanship</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Each class in Battlefield 6 is paired with a particular squad role. This is supported by a signature gadget, trait, and a skill with a specific weapon type. But don't worry, you <strong>aren't locked into one class type</strong>. You can make custom loadouts for each and swap on the fly mid-match.</p><p dir="ltr">All class types can be impactful on the modes for large maps, but smaller game modes like Squad Deathmatch are infantry only, making classes like the Engineer less useful.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Open_and_closed_weapon_systems">Open and closed weapon systems</h2><p dir="ltr">In the past, Battlefield's four signature roles featured a class-locked weapon system. This meant that Support players were limited to wielding light machine guns, the Recon class had sniper rifles, Engineers had submachine guns, and the Assault players were the only ones who got to use assault rifles.</p><p dir="ltr">In Battlefield 6, the developer is giving players the option to choose between playlists that feature closed or open weapon systems. The open system means you can pair any weapon class with any role you choose to play. However, there are some slight bonuses you can score for choosing to utilize the game's closed weapon system. Using the signature weapon assigned to a specific class gives you additional perks on the battlefield, such as improved hip-fire control for Engineers who choose a submachine gun. We'll explain these signature weapon benefits for each class below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Assault_class">Assault class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581196"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581196-bf6-101-assault-class-asset1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Assault class is probably the most straightforward and beginner-friendly role to play. In the Assault role, you're the frontline fighter who is equipped to charge toward objectives or the enemy line. You're armed with a grenade launcher and abilities geared for using breach and clear tactics.</p><p dir="ltr">If you used the Assault class in the beta, you'll find there are a few changes to the role for the launch of Battlefield 6. The signature trait has been adjusted to help speed up capturing objectives, and the Adrenaline Injector no longer provides self-healing abilities.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Assault Rifle. This grants faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from assault rifles</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Speeds up capturing objectives for nearby squad members and takes you and your team out of combat status faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Adrenaline Injector. This clears and boosts resistance to flash and stun effects, enhances tolerance to explosive and incendiary damage, and improves movement speed</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability: </strong>Nearby enemies that are audible become revealed for the player, with kills prolonging the effect</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Breacher: These units have quicker reloads on grenade launchers, can carry extra grenades, and are more resistant to flash effects.</li><li dir="ltr">Frontliner: These soldiers have improved health regeneration, an additional adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty when shooting on the move.</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Frontliner</strong> is going to be a great pick, especially for beginners, as it helps provide better health regeneration and comes with an additional Adrenaline Injector charge. <strong>Breacher</strong> is the choice if you're more excited about the game's destruction and just wanna blow stuff up.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Assault_gadgets">Assault gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Since the beta, the developer has also added additional gadgets exclusive to the Assault class to make them more helpful with a role focused on teamwork: Assault ladder and Deploy Beacon.</p><p dir="ltr">The ladder lets Assault players create higher vantage points for their team. The Deploy Beacon offers a spawn point, but it has a limited number of uses per squad and will self-destruct if the Assault player spawns back on it. This is designed to be a tactical and limited resource rather than a persistent advantage.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gadget options include: Thermobaric (fire) grenade launcher, high-explosive grenade launcher, and shotgun.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Assault_class">Best weapons for Assault class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for ARs in Battlefield 6. This assault rifle has a fast fire rate, and the recoil can be easily controlled with some of the gun's best attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not focused on picking the class's signature weapon, the <strong>M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> is another great option for close to mid-range fights.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_class">Engineer class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581197"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581197-bf6-101-engineer-class-asset2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Engineers play a crucial role in Battlefield 6. They're not only armed with rockets for destruction, but they're also the ones who are equipped with the repair tool capability for repairing their team's vehicles. Tanks are often used for bullying through enemy defenses and holding objectives with firepower, and a good Engineer is often following their friendly tanks, making sure those vehicles stay fit for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">On the destruction side, Engineers make use of their rockets and explosives for disabling enemy vehicles and tactical destruction. A well-placed rocket or some other explosives can take down structures in a way that helps the team.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Submachine Guns: Improved hip-fire control</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait: </strong>Take reduced damage from explosives</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Repair Tool: Multitool for fixing friendly assets and armor. It can also be used to damage enemy assets</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Overloads the repair tool to fix vehicles with enhanced efficiency</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training Paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Anti-Armor: A master of wreaking havoc on enemy vehicles with rockets that reduce repair effectiveness, as well as extra ammunition and faster reloads for launchers</li><li dir="ltr">Combat Engineer: An expert dedicated to keeping everything in pristine shape. This soldier auto-generates health of vehicles they're occupying, is able to use their repair tool longer before overheating, and can automatically spot nearby mines</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. One is geared towards taking out enemy tanks and other vehicles, while the other path is designed to help you repair your friendly vehicles. <strong>Combat Engineer</strong> can be a great pick if you're the one who likes to ride around tanks, as the ability allows vehicles to auto-generate health while you're inside.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Engineer_gadgets">Engineer gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Engineers can choose from a selection of launchers, a supply crate, and a variety of different mines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Engineer_class">Best weapons for Engineer class</h3><p dir="ltr">If you're sticking with the closed-weapons playlist, you'll want to consider the <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong>. The SGX was a standout during the beta, offering a fast rate of fire, high damage, and virtually no recoil with the right attachments.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're playing in the open-weapons playlist, you might want something with better range than a submachine gun can offer. The <strong>NVO-228E assault rifle</strong> is one of the strongest picks for mid-range combat.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Support_class">Support class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198" data-ratio="0.56208791208791" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581198"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581198-bf6-101-support-class-asset3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Support class essentially plays the hero role in Battlefield 6. Support players are the medics, who run into the fight to revive downed teammates and protect their numbers on the map. They also provide their team with supply bags that offer health and ammo. Some game modes are geared toward team life counts, so having good medics on your team can be crucial for the win.</p><p dir="ltr">It is worth noting that anyone can revive downed players in Battlefield 6, but no one does it faster and more efficiently than a medic.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Light Machine Guns. Player does not suffer a sprint speed penalty with this weapon type</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Can drag and revive teammates faster</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Supply Bag. Heals allies and resupplies weapon and gadget ammo</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> The supply area of effect around Support player is temporarily increased, as well as the speed at which they revive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Combat Medic: These units are able to function as a health dispensary for allies and also regenerate health when they're reviving teammates</li><li dir="ltr">Fire Support: These combat experts have improved weapon control from mounted positions and can provide ammo to teammates</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. <strong>Fire Support</strong> might be a decent option for you if you're planning on using LMGs for the closed-weapon system, but in most cases the <strong>Combat Medic</strong> is going to be the most powerful choice for really leaning into the role of a medic. Being able to regenerate your health while reviving allies is a nice bonus.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Support_gadgets">Support gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Support players can choose from the Defibrillator paddles for faster revives or deployable cover for helping provide protection to teammates.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Support_class">Best weapons for Support class</h3><p dir="ltr">Let's be honest, the LMGs don't always feel great to use. However, the <strong>L110 light machine gun</strong> can be equipped with some decent attachments to help manage the recoil and increase the damage range.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the signature LMG weapon class, a submachine gun or assault rifle can be a good choice when you're trying to take out enemies to perform a heroic revive. The <strong>SGX submachine gun</strong> or the<strong> M4A1 carbine rifle</strong> could be a good pick.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Recon_class">Recon class</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581199"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4581199-bf6-101-recon-class-asset4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Recon class is geared toward stealth, sniping, and gathering helpful intel. Recon players can spot enemies for their teammates and also earn a UAV. Playstyles can vary between posting up on a hillside and sniping away at enemy forces or using stealth to flank and get behind enemy lines. So, you can pick what style caters best to you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Weapon:</strong> Sniper Rifles. Offers faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control to help stabilize aim for longer</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Trait:</strong> Automatically spot enemies while aiming through an optic</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Signature Gadget:</strong> Motion Sensor. This gadget tracks enemy movement in its range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Active Ability:</strong> Call in a UAV to a marked position for passive spotting of enemies</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Training paths:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Sniper: These long-distance engagement experts have improved auto-spot speed, range, and duration. Sniper shots will highlight enemies and temporarily prevent healing, while headshots will render the struck enemy unable to be revived at all</li><li dir="ltr">Spec Ops: Allows quieter takedowns, crouch, and prone movement. It also allows the player to spot nearby enemy gadgets. Going prone takes the player out of combat much faster and removes the spot on self</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You have two different Field Training paths to choose from, and this will depend on your playstyle and preference. Which path you choose greatly depends on how you want to play the Recon role. If you want to post up and snipe, then you'll want to choose the <strong>Sniper</strong> training path, while <strong>Spec Ops</strong> is the choice for getting mobile and infiltrating enemy locations with stealth play.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Recon_gadgets">Recon gadgets</h3><p dir="ltr">Recon players will have access to a recon drone, C-4 explosives, and gadgets geared toward getting intel for their team.</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, the Recon class had the Spawn Beacon to provide a dedicated respawn point, but this device was relocated to the Assault class after the beta.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Best_weapons_for_Recon_Class">Best weapons for Recon Class</h3><p dir="ltr">The <strong>M2010 ESR sniper rifle</strong> is the best choice for sniping in the Recon class. You'll need to add some attachments to help boost the gun's damage range and performance, but this is a solid pick for sticking with the signature weapon of the Recon class.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're not the most skilled sniper, but you still want something for long-range fights, you can ditch the sniper class for a DMR rifle. The <strong>M39 EMR</strong> and the <strong>SVK-8.6</strong> can both be solid picks for DMR rifles.</p>
