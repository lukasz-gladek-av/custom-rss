But before Larian puts the latest patch through a stress test with players, the developer has shared more details about what to expect.</p><p>Photo mode and 12 new subclasses are among the new features that stand out in Patch 8. There are also a number of bug fixes and in-game mod improvements. Larian's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/782037674453106724" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> notes that there have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-celebrates-100-million-mod-downloads-with-withers-big-naturals-mod/1100-6528842/" data-ref-id="1100-6528842">100 million mod downloads</a> to date. The company also promised that more mods are being approved for console players.</p><p>Mac players also have new minimum specs for Baldur's Gate 3. Larian now suggests that Mac users update their system to macOS 14 (version 14.7.1) or later. Older Macs that can't be updated to that level can still play Baldur's Gate 3 through Patch 6.</p><p>Players can <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">register to preview the patch in the upcoming stress test</a>. However, Mac players won't be able to use cross-platform play during that period. The Patch 8 stress test will let Xbox, PlayStation, and PC players try out the cross-platform play by creating or joining a lobby to find friends through the Larian Network. Xbox players will need to download the Xbox Insider Hub app to register for the stress test. However, Larian notes that the stress test will be going out in waves of players, and registering for it doesn't guarantee that players will be able to participate. </p><p>Larian recently announced that it is now focusing on a new project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>. Any potential sequel to Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">will be developed by other studios</a>. You can find the Patch 8 bug notes below, but beware of some of the spoilers in there.</p><h3>Incoming Bug Fixes</h3><p>Along with the new features, we’re continuing to clean up animation pops, clipping, and have fixed bugs, including the likes of:</p><ul><li>Fixed a savegame issue where you wouldn't get the appropriate amount of Umbral Gems for the Gauntlet of Shar.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing you to get stuck at a 0% loading screen when attempting to join a multiplayer session that uses mods.</li><li>Your character will no longer think Shadowheart is dead if she isn't when talking to</li><li>Halsin will now show up to your camp in Act II as long as you save him, even if you happen to skip the celebration with the tieflings at camp.</li><li>Improved performance in the Adamantine Forge.</li><li>Minthara will now comment on reveal.</li><li>Cerys will stop getting involved in combats with Minthara from across the region. An eager beaver no longer.</li><li>We’ve also reminded Minthara that 'knocked out' does not mean 'dead', so she'll more reliably appear in Moonrise Towers.</li><li>Fixed companions' lines getting cut off prematurely after Gale at the end of the game.</li><li>Fixed a bug preventing Wyll from commenting on Astarion holding a blade to your throat during Astarion's recruitment dialogue by the beach.</li><li>Barcus is no longer Mike Wazowski'd by various items like cauldrons and bottles blocking him off from view when you talk to him at Last Light.</li></ul><h3>In-Game Mod Manager Improvements</h3><ul><li>Removed the third-party mods warning and replaced it with clearer messaging.</li><li>The Mod Verification window will now trigger regardless of where the request to connect to a multiplayer game is coming from.</li></ul>

That said, given the Switch's success and continued popularity, the Switch 2 will likely be in high demand.

Assuming it's specifically a Switch 1 game, that could mean it releases before the Switch 2 drops later this year-- though some speculate it will be a cross-gen title that launches simultaneously on Switch 2. Either way, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond preorders are not yet available. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-is-canceling-metroid-prime-4-beyond-preorders/1100-6528752/" data-ref-id="1100-6528752">Amazon is canceling preorders</a> for the version of the game that Amazon listed after it was initially revealed back in 2017, which could indicate the game is coming soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Until then, Metroid fans can preorder copies of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-premium-metroid-prime-trilogy-art-book-is-launching-next-year/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective art book</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metroid-2026-Wall-Calendar-Nintendo/dp/1419783483?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metroid Prime 2026 Wall Calendar</a>.

One story that stood out from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/jMsGB2PItes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his chat with Kinda Funny</a> was about the one PlayStation game that didn't sell as well as expected.</p><p>He said during interview (<a href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1879757684225765509" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Radec</a>) that Horizon Forbidden West, a sequel to Horizon Zero Dawn, was the one game he was surprised to see come up short commercially, relatively speaking.</p><p>"The one I was a bit surprised in terms of the number of units was the second Horizon game. I loved the first Horizon game and the game did well, and I was hoping the second game would do even better in terms of sales. The game was bigger and great but I don't think the second game did as many units as the first one," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMsGB2PItes" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="40">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jMsGB2PItes?start=40" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zero Dawn launched in 2017 and had sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-zero-dawn-passes-20-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-forbidden-west/1100-6500599/" data-ref-id="1100-6500599">20 million copies as of early 2022</a> across PlayStation and PC.

The PC editions of both games came after they originally launched on console, and Forbidden West was not yet on PC when the 8.4 million sales number was announced.</p><p>The Horizon series also expanded to virtual reality with Horizon: Call of the Mountain and to the family market with Lego Horizon Adventures.

However, this reveal comes across as overly corporate, bland, and lacking a basic sense of joy that should accompany the introduction of a brand-new video game system.</p><p dir="ltr">There isn't a human in sight for the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. Instead, the majority of the two-and-a-half minute video features an off-white background and CGI animation to showcase how Switch 2 differs from the original Switch. Clearly, Nintendo doesn't want <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wii-u-is-not-a-peripheral-nintendo-reminds-shoppers/1100-6416840/">a Wii U situation on its hands</a>, spelling out clearly that Switch 2 isn't some add-on to the original and will replace the previous system. However, the teaser feels too much like a basic upgrade trailer--way too similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izljcyvozig">the New Nintendo 3DS XL first look</a>, for example--than shouting out Switch 2 is the next generation of Nintendo gaming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1914440195" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

However, that reveal trailer feels so much more full of life (thanks to actual people being present) and creativity than what we experienced today. The Switch introduction video begins with a man playing The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on his TV screen, before quickly snapping to the Switch logo and to show how he can take the system on the go. The hook of the system is showcased up front as the guy brings the Switch with him to take his dog to a park in the early morning. While unconfirmed, if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> works or even has better visuals on Switch 2, maybe showing that anticipated game on Switch 2 could have provided a similar sense of awe or at least an idea of the system's technical prowess.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, Nintendo presents all of the various ways the Switch can be utilized, whether on an airplane or even during a rooftop party. This reveal trailer also sees actual people interacting with and using the system--something that isn't present at all with the Switch 2 first look. Nintendo also sprinkles in a handful of third-party games with the original Switch, giving a better idea at what's on the way for the system. For instance, this was when we learned that Skyrim would come to the console. Now, for context, third-party support had absolutely cratered on Wii U, so the company needed to convey that partners were on board with Switch. However, it would have been nice for Nintendo to give third parties the option to tease their games with Switch 2 instead of only vague Mario Kart footage. Showing that Fortnite will, in fact, work on Switch 2 seems like a no-brainer and easy win.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="77104904" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

last third of Switch's unveiling is where Nintendo really flexes its muscles compared to what we see with Switch 2. The Switch unveiling not only shares gameplay footage of what ends up being Super Mario Odyssey, but also offers up a teaser for Splatoon 2 (though people were unsure it was a full sequel at the time). Once again, with Switch 2, Nintendo presents a pretty uninspired glimpse at a new Mario Kart--presumably Mario Kart 9. Of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-8-deluxe-is-nintendo-best-selling-game-of-all-time/1100-6523297/">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is basically Nintendo's best-selling game ever</a>, so if Switch 2 launches with a new entry, it will do gangbusters. But the presentation behind this could have been injected with at least a little bit of fun or at the very least highlight how this new Mario Kart will be unique. (Eagle-eyed fans believe 24 racers can compete at one time, and Donkey Kong seems redesigned to more closely resemble his appearance in the New Super Mario Bros. Movie.)</p><p dir="ltr">The most intriguing part of the Switch 2 unveiling relates to what appears to be optical sensors in each new Joy-Con. Nintendo then has a small segment where the controllers seem like they're ice-skating across a surface, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+mouse+controls+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">possibly hinting that Switch 2 will feature mouse-like controls</a>. If true, why not shout out to everyone that there is new functionality behind the Joy-Cons for Switch 2? Why only point out the magnetic aspect? To me, showing mouse-like controls on Switch 2 with something like a new Mario Paint, Mario Maker, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, or even an old game like Minecraft would have added a bit more wonder and excitement to this reveal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to wave away complaints and claim Nintendo will sell boatloads of Switch 2 systems regardless. But first impressions matter. Has Nintendo given up on expanding the video game user base? Because this video implies that to me. Nothing about Switch 2 looks revolutionary or particularly refreshing. Instead, this is more of the same. Maybe that's all that's needed: not rocking the boat on a system that people already love.</p><p dir="ltr">But Nintendo, historically, has struggled when the company gets conservative and complacent. So far, Switch 2 seems way too safe. That said, with a Switch 2 Direct coming on April 2, there is plenty of time to build up the hype train.</p>
