                <p>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy Entertainment launched its newest game, the co-op FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a>, in mid-June. The game didn't exactly take the world by storm, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with Steam concurrents topping out under 300 over the last week</a>, and Remedy itself admitting it "had hoped for a better launch." But Steam concurrent numbers do not tell the whole story, of course, and Remedy isn't giving up on Firebreak. Far from it.</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Remedy communications director Thomas Puha responded to the game's launch and outlined some of what's to come as part of the game's ongoing content roadmap. Puha said the team at Remedy is "super motivated" to build upon FBC and make changes based on player feedback. More than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1 million people</a> have played the game so far, and players haven't wasted time submitting feedback.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online," Puha explained.</p><p>We also asked Puha about the decision to bring Firebreak to Game Pass and PlayStation Plus at launch. He said Remedy is still crunching the numbers, but remarked that a "good number" of new players are joining FBC on console every day via the subscription services from Microsoft and Sony.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p>"We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development." -- Remedy's Thomas Puha</p></blockquote><p>Some in the video game industry have questioned whether or not it makes good business sense to launch new games directly into a subscription service, including those who have done just that. Recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/" data-ref-id="1100-6532306">the developer of the day-one Game Pass release Revenge of the Savage Planet questioned whether it was indeed a good idea to launch the game into Game Pass</a>, citing concerns about the "devaluation" of content. We don't know about the financial specifics for any deals Remedy may have made for Firebreak, however. At the same time, others have argued that launching directly into a subscription service could be a recipe for success to help a game reach a wider audience out of the gate.</p><p>Beyond financial performance, Puha said it's "pretty clear" that although people who may join Firebreak from Game Pass or PS Plus might not stick with the game for as long as someone who may have bought the game outright, "it's also easier for them to return."</p><p>Puha also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">reiterated</a> that Firebreak was never designed to require people to play every day to unlock daily login rewards or anything that could make it feel like playing Firebreak was "your other job." The game was purposefully designed to not take over your life, he said. "Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of major updates," he said. "We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development."</p><p>While Puha said Remedy has already had to make key strategic decisions like prioritizing some areas and deprioritizing others due to the feedback at launch, he said fans can expect Remedy to stick with FBC. "Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year," he said.</p><p>You can read our full interview with Puha below.</p><p>Next up for Firebreak is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3 patch</a>, which is targeting release early this week. Remedy said the patch aims to "enhanced the overall game experience" with things like changes to the game's perk economy. This follows on from a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-bringing-major-changes-to-fbc-firebreak-after-launch-backlash/1100-6532591/" data-ref-id="1100-6532591">previous patch that responded to some initial frustrations</a> with the game about the onboarding and progression, among other things.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/" data-ref-id="1900-6418376">FBC: Firebreak review</a> scored the game an 8/10. "FBC: Firebreak is an enjoyably chaotic power fantasy, and an interesting experiment for Remedy between its bigger, weirder projects," reviewer Mark Delaney wrote.</p><p>Remedy's ongoing support for Firebreak is just one of the development efforts that remains ongoing at the company. The Finnish studio is also working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-enters-full-production-as-alan-wake-2-has-finally-recouped-development-costs/1100-6529420/" data-ref-id="1100-6529420">Control 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/max-payne-1-and-2-remakes/">remakes of Max Payne and May Payne 2.</a></p><p><b>Can you speak to the Steam numbers for FBC so far, and how do you view Steam in terms of importance relative to console in the overall mix?</b></p><p>Steam is a very important part of the business of FBC: Firebreak. The Steam CCU is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn't everything.</p><p>We aren't naïve; we had hoped for a better launch, but the team here is super-motivated to continue building the game and responding to player feedback. We already reacted during launch week with patch 1.2, making some big changes to the game. As Remedy does, we'll do things with smaller teams in our way and try to solve challenges creatively.</p><p><b>What can Remedy say about launching FBC directly into Game Pass and PS Plus? Did this have the desired results for Remedy thus far?</b></p><p>Subscription services are an easy way for a large number of players to try the game, and it's great for cross-platform matchmaking--you have more folks to play with.</p><p>Being on these services also makes it easy for players to return when we release new updates and exciting new content.</p><p><b>What trends has Remedy observed for the Game Pass/PS Plus audience relative to people who may have bought the game outright? Are you seeing people who have never played a Remedy game before try it out, thanks to the subscription offering?</b></p><p>It's very early days, and we have a lot of data, which is very helpful for a game like this. We can see there is a significant number of FBC: Firebreak players who, for example, don't own Control. The game's a bit bewildering for them, to say the least, but we are going to improve on that significantly. Then, it's pretty clear that players from subscription services tend to stick around for shorter periods than those who purchased the game, but it's also easier for them to return. There is a good number of new players coming in every day on consoles.</p><p><b>What are some efforts you might take to help grow the FBC player base and retain the players you have already?</b></p><p>The simple answer is to develop and release great content to the game now that it's live. Post-launch content, as we have always said, will be free. Listen to the player base to understand what they want; their opinion is what matters, while ensuring that Remedy's creativity remains in the mix.</p><p>We never designed the game to be something that requires daily login for some random stuff, making the game your other job. Instead, you play Firebreak for a while, take a break, and come back when we release new content in the form of Major Updates.</p><p>We feel strongly that what we have in the pipeline is going to be exciting for players. There is some game-changing content in development.</p><p>One of the great things about an online game like FBC: Firebreak is that we receive a wealth of player data and community feedback to inform our decision-making. We read all of it, and we are there talking with the players online.</p><p>The drive within the Remedy development team is incredible to see, but of course, the content ultimately will decide what players think, not words.</p><p>It's been interesting to examine the data and feedback, and see that players who spent many hours playing the experience rated the game significantly higher than those who ended it early. So we know we've got something great at the core of the game.</p><p>We didn’t do a great job at all with onboarding and what we call the “first hours” progression, so players' frustration at the beginning of the game is understandable when there are a lot of systems thrown at you with little explanation, and the tier 1 weapons weren’t hitting that hard amongst other things.</p><p><b>What level of ongoing support can FBC players expect going forward as it relates to new content and updates?</b></p><p>Let's keep in mind the game is barely a week and a half old. We have a lot to process.</p><p>We outlined our post-launch plans before releasing the game, so there are two new Jobs and features coming in 2025. That's still the case.</p><p>Ultimately, we always knew that the launch of these types of games would have an impact on our post-launch roadmap. As it has proven to be, we've rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live. The game is live, players' feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.</p><p>We relied more on building game systems that we can expand in the future, and we can do so, so much more. We are going to discuss what's coming to the game in the near future. It takes time to review the feedback, assess what's possible, and communicate it.</p><p>It's exciting that the game starts evolving now that its live, Remedy is fully committed to FBC: Firebreak. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year.</p>

                <p>Believe it or not, the Bandai Namco fighter-jet series Ace Combat is now three decades old. To commemorate the anniversary of the first game's release in Japan on June 30, 1995, the company has put out a neat video showing off how the series has evolved over time.</p><p>The short movie highlights clips from various Ace Combat games, giving a glimpse of how the colorful PlayStation 1 art of Air Combat (the first entry in the series) transformed into the hyper-realistic near-future science-fiction of the later entries, such as Ace Combat 7.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYWwUqkBXAI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OYWwUqkBXAI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the series sizzle reel, the video also teases some projects in the works to further celebrate the anniversary. For instance, Bandai Namco overhauled the Ace Combat website, and it announced <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/30th-anniversary-event1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a special symphony</a> to be held on January 31, 2026 at Japan's Saitama Kaikan concert hall. Bandai Namco also shared that additional projects will be announced beginning in July.</p><p>It's cool to see how far Ace Combat has come since the early days. Being roughly the same age as the series and having grown up in the 2000s, I have a soft spot for Ace Combat 5 and Ace Combat 6. I remember playing the fifth game for hours at kiosks in local Targets, and the sixth was one of the first games I owned on my Xbox 360.</p><p>For those of you who, like me, are looking forward to seeing what the Ace Combat team can do with modern hardware, we'll likely still have to wait for a while. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ace-combat-game-confirmed-new-developer-involved/1100-6495310/" data-ref-id="1100-6495310">announced back in 2021</a> that a new game is in the works, but there's been little additional information since then. It does seem like work continues, though: In <a href="https://acecombat.jp/en/news/fan-message/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post to fans</a> today, series brand director Kazutoki Kono wrote, "We're ready. Everything is in place. It's time to take flight once again--toward even greater heights."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Remasters and remakes are arguably more popular than ever--in video games and even movies--but Sega doesn't sound too keen to revisit the Sonic Adventure series. Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka was recently asked about updating <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-adventure-2-review/1900-2777051/">Sonic Adventure 2</a> specifically and stated there are "no plans" for it.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144842/takashi-iizuka-sonic-racing-crossworlds-interview-june-2025" rel="nofollow ">Shacknews</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-adventure-director-says-dont-expect-remakes-or-remasters-anytime-soon/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Iizuka was discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworld-preorders-are-live-on-console-and-pc/1100-6532225/">the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> when the interviewer mentioned their love for Sonic Adventure 2. As such, Iizuka was asked about remaking or revisiting the 2001 game, to which the developer replied: "I am really appreciative of everyone who likes the Sonic Adventure series, but when I think about what it would take to bring that game up to the standards and expectations of what the modern gaming audience would want, I think it would be about as much time and energy as it would to make a new title."</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As such, Iizuka noted that "part of me is thinking maybe I should just make a brand new title and that’s why there's currently no plans." What's interesting here is that 2011's Sonic Generations did get a remaster as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/">Sonic X Shadows Generations</a> from last year. The game also arrived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">on Switch 2</a> earlier this month.</p><p>Up next for Sonic Team is the previously mentioned Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. It's the fourth entry in the racing subseries for the Blue Blur and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-feature-hatsune-miku-and-persona-5s-joker/1100-6532201/">will feature crossover characters like Persona 5's Joker</a> and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/sonic-racing-crossworlds-spongebob-squarepants-character-reveal-trailer/2300-6466144/">SpongeBob Squarepants</a>. Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch September 25 on PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. A Switch 2 version is also in the works for a later date.</p>

                <p>Next year marks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-25th-anniversary-year-will-be-really-special-phil-spencer-says/1100-6532334/" data-ref-id="1100-6532334">the 25th anniversary of Xbox</a>, but one of the console's original team members, Laura Fryer, is openly questioning one element of Microsoft's gaming division. Fryer--who no longer works for Xbox--recently shared her response to Microsoft's recent handheld and console partnerships and concluded that the company "has no desire" to create hardware anymore.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFG7YxFFCnY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-is-dead-says-founding-team-member-it-looks-like-xbox-has-no-desire-or-literally-cant-ship-hardware-anymore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Fryer noted that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> won't have any exclusive games to drive sales and added that Microsoft's partnerships with Asus on the handheld and AMD on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">the next generation of Xbox</a> reflects a dim future for its consoles.</p><p>"Obviously, as one of the founding members of the Xbox team, I'm not pleased with where things are today," said Fryer. "I don't love watching all of the value that I helped create slowly get eroded away. I'm sad because, from my perspective, it looks like Xbox has no desire--or literally can't--ship hardware anymore. So, this partnership is about a slow exit from the hardware business completely. Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead."</p><p>Fryer acknowledged that remasters of classic games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> have been massively successful, but she questioned Xbox's ability to make new hits. She also notes that Microsoft has a valuable resource in Game Pass, but believes that it's not enough to drive hardware sales on its own.</p><p>Former Xbox Live and Game Pass vice president Mike Ybarra had a slightly different assessment on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1939298865976647790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. While Ybarra also believes that Microsoft is pulling back from hardware, he thinks it can become the biggest gaming publisher if it focuses on that goal alone.</p><p>"They have to figure out what needs to change, and fast," wrote Ybarra. "I'm a big fan and will always bleed green... Pick your lane and stick to it... It's simple to me, Xbox should strive to be the world's largest publisher of entertainment content. Get rid of everything else and get focused. Do not be afraid to say what you are. Embrace the lane... Straddling the fence is not a winning plan."</p><p>A recent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-coming-soon/1100-6532671/" data-ref-id="1100-6532671">a new round of layoffs may hit Microsoft's gaming division</a> as soon as this week. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said multiple times that the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">needs to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's latest quarterly report</a> noted that net revenue the company achieved net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division also posted year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
