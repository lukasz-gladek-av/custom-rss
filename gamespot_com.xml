                <p>The second incarnation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> debuted in 2013, and it's proven to be far more resilient than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">the version that arrived in 2010</a>. However, there's been discontent in the FF14 community lately over the removal of a popular mod, which led to the game's subsequent review-bombing on Steam. Now, director Naoki Yoshida has addressed the mod controversy with an appeal to players.</p><p>Yoshida's complete remarks were <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/1e4a8b0e8b84ea8dac61ae07af02e0c425de74aa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on FF14's official site</a>, and he requested that excerpts from his statement not be used by media outlets. But since his response was nearly 2,000 words, a concise recap is unavoidable. The issue started when Square Enix's lawyers sent a letter to modder DarkArchon regarding Mare Synchronos, a mod that allowed players' customized avatars to be visible outside of their own game. Once Mare Synchronos was removed at Square Enix's request, some fans <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/why-final-fantasy-xiv-fans-are-review-bombing-the-game-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their fury in the form of negative Steam reviews</a>.</p><p>Although Yoshida notes that he tolerates mods and has admiration for some fan-made creations, he's against mods that violate the game's intent or design in a negative manner. As a potential example, Yoshida noted that Square Enix could face legal consequences in some countries over nude character mods on display in the game. He also cited customized appearances that mimic paid content from from the game as an example of devaluing the services and collectibles that Square Enix sells to provide the revenue the game needs to remain financially viable.</p><p>Yoshida concluded his statement by saying he respects the tradition of modding in PC games, but he also requests that players do so while respecting the rules and integrity of FF14.</p><p>Late last year, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-free-to-play-will-kick-off-with-a-realm-reborn/1100-6527979/" data-ref-id="1100-6527979">expanded Final Fantasy 14 into the mobile realm</a> and released the game's fifth expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Dawntrail</a>. More recently, Yoshida has shared his intent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-support-on-ps4-looks-uncertain-but-yoshi-p-is-working-to-keep-it-going/1100-6534307/" data-ref-id="1100-6534307">to make sure Final Fantasy 14 remains compatible with PlayStation 4</a> as long as possible. However, he added that the limitations of the PS4 hardware may make that less feasible going forward.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has a friendly public image thanks to its line of family-friendly games, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> developer Bloober Team wants to start a second golden age of horror on Switch 2. During the GameCube era, Nintendo's console was home to numerous cult-classic horror games, and Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno wants to see more spine-tingling games released for Nintendo hardware.</p><p>"I'm trying to make my personal dreams come true," Babieno said to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "I am a huge Nintendo fan. I grew up with Nintendo consoles. The most important horrors, like Eternal Darkness, Resident Evil 0, Resident Evil 4--were available on Nintendo GameCube. It was a golden time for Nintendo fans. In some ways, we would like to be the ones to open a new chapter for Nintendo right now. We have some plans. We are not able to share our vision for the future yet. But definitely Nintendo fans could take a look at Bloober Team."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cronos: The New Dawn Could Be The Beginning Of A New Era For Bloober Team</p>
      </div>
<p>Babieno added that Luigi's Mansion could be a good indicator of what fans can expect from the studio, as it gave players a cozy horror experience. The CEO says that there is a "huge possibility to repeat such an idea" in the future.</p><p>Cronos: The New Dawn is one of only a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">handful of horror games that have been announced for the Switch 2</a>. Little Nightmares 3 looks like it'll spike heart rates--in a good way--but so far, it looks like Bloober's upcoming game is the only one that'll offer Switch 2 players a gory and unnerving experience as players travel through time and face off against nightmarish creatures that can merge with each other to gain a fleshy power-up.</p><p>The game will also be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches on September 3. "Cronos has impressed in the two hours I've played it so far, and though I still have questions and will reserve my final judgment for the full game later this year, it's clear the team has found its secret weapon in how it has designed Cronos' combat gameplay," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cronos-the-new-dawn-is-tense-like-the-silent-hill-2-remake-but-with-a-twist/1100-6533465/">Cronos: the New Dawn preview</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a> has only been out for two weeks, but EA has already prepared the first update for this year's edition. Most of the changes address bugs or other issues that have come up since the game officially launched on August 14. It's also introducing Nike Rivalries, a new feature that will bring "community pride" to some of the most famous rivalries in the league.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA</a>, Nike Rivalries is part of a new four-year deal between Nike and the NFL that will "celebrate football's most storied rivalries" with customized uniforms that represent their respective cities. Each iteration of Nike Rivalries will focus on teams from two different divisions, and this year's subjects are the AFC East and NFC West.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558728"></a><figcaption>Players from the NFC West and AFC East show off their custom looks in Nike Rivalries.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4558728-nflrivalries.jpg"></figure><p>EA also announced that the Madden NFL 26 update will introduce a customized playbook that was created in collaboration with retired quarterback Kurt Benkert. The playbook is called Benkert's Dimes, and it's available in Play Now when selecting playbooks.</p><p>The remaining issues addressed in this update are largely specific to certain plays or situations. Additionally, EA notes that it will address a few other fixes in later updates, including the Class Import Process incorrectly modifying player body types, the inability to take players off of the IR list, and nose tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</p><p>The complete list of changes in Madden NFL 26's first update can be found below:</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>Cover 2 Tampa - The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3x1 formations.</p><p>Cover 2 Hard Flats - Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</p><p>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</p><p>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms - Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns.
