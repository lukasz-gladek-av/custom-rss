                <p>It wasn't that long ago that Xbox Series X|S owners could only use official Microsoft controllers for wireless play. Outside of modded options from brands like Scuf, the Xbox Wireless Controller and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2 Controllers</a> were the only choices. And while Microsoft's official controllers are quite good, it's always nice to have different models to choose from. So it was a great development when Microsoft opened its wireless protocol to licensed manufacturers. Over the past two years, the market for wireless third-party Xbox controllers has actually become a bit crowded. The latest notable Elite Series 2 challenger to enter the pro-style controller ring is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited</a>.</p><div title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3531" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Xbox &amp; PC Wireless Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><p>The Nacon Revolution X Unlimited has a bevy of premium features, including numerous physical modifications and input customization options.

Though the latest member of the Revolution lineup has some familiar features--the interchangeable weights, for instance--the Revolution X Unlimited does have components not found on Revolution 5 Pro. Most notably, the Xbox edition adds a built-in LCD display and has two swappable D-pads--the Revolution 5 Pro has a custom fighting game-centric D-pad.</p><p>The built-in customization screen is a handy feature that we've seen in a few other controllers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach's Stealth Ultra</a>. It works well, allowing you to remap inputs and create custom profiles. If you plug a wired headset into the 3.5mm audio jack, you can tinker with the EQ settings and game/chat balance directly on the controller. I found the onboard controls helpful since the Revolution X Unlimited software app for Xbox and PC is a bit buggy at the moment, especially on Xbox, where the app crashed while trying to adjust settings. On the flip side, I didn't run into any problems while using the built-in screen.</p><p>In terms of feel, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited accomplishes the task of <em>feeling </em>like a high-end controller. The Hall Effect sticks have a smooth, precise range of motion, and the microswitch face buttons are quick and deliver satisfying feedback. The weighting system is one of the coolest features, especially since part of the reason why Microsoft's Elite Series 2 feels so good is because of its weight distribution. The Revolution X Unlimited's textured grips on the back of the handles can be popped off to switch between the three different weight sets, allowing users to find their preferred "heftiness."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png" data-ref-id="1300-4497318"></a><figcaption>Nacon Revolution X Unlimited Controller for Xbox/PC/Android</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4497318-naconrevolutionx.png"></figure><p>The only aspect of the Revolution X Unlimited that I've found very difficult to get accustomed to is the unique shape and placement of the remappable back buttons. The lower pair of back buttons are shaped like right triangles and positioned near the bottom of the handles. The upper pair of buttons are quadrilateral with irregular sides.</p><p>The shapes are peculiar, but the low placement is what makes them feel quite different compared to many pro-style controllers with back buttons. Typically, my middle and ring fingers naturally rest on the back buttons of similar controllers, including the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro for Xbox/PC</a></strong>. With the Revolution X Unlimited, my normal hand placement set my ring and pinky fingers on the back buttons, which felt awkward. As such, I had to shift my grip downward slightly. If you're used to other pro-style controllers with four back buttons, the Revolution X Unlimited likely won't be easy to use at first. Even after testing it for a few weeks, I still find the layout to be disorienting.</p><p>Outside of the back button placement--which could <i>maybe </i>be more comfortable for players with larger hands--the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited's feature set and components are solid. Along with the adjustable weights, it comes with six rubberized stick caps, two pairs of resistance rings for the sticks, two metal D-pads, a charging stand, and a nice hardshell carrying case to hold everything. It also benefits from adjustable trigger locks, two extra shoulder buttons, and immersive rumble thanks to motors located in both the handles and triggers.</p><p>If the back buttons were more conventional, the Nacon Revolution X Unlimited might have eclipsed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/razer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review/1100-6526158/" data-ref-id="1100-6526158">Wolverine V3 Pro as my favorite Elite Series 2 alternative</a>. If you think the back buttons on the Elite Series 2 and other controllers are too close together or located too high, the Revolution X Unlimited might work out well for you. That said, if you're anything like me, you may wind up viewing it as a controller with only two back buttons--I have abandoned the bottom two buttons and only sparingly use the other two. Considering back buttons are arguably the first thing that comes to mind when thinking about pro-style controllers, this potential concession is a big one.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F14XLBDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nacon Revolution X Unlimited is available now for $200</a>, the same MSRP as the Wolverine V3 Pro and the Elite Series 2 following Microsoft's recent price increase. That said, you can get the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elite Series 2 for $159 at Amazon</a> right now.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-board-game-monkey-palace-strategy-building-set-amazon-deal-2025/1100-6528660/">Lego Monkey Palace Board Game Is Over 50% Off At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-leverless-arcade-controller-xbox-switch-2-pc-preorder-amazon/1100-6531585/">8BitDo Reveals Leverless Arcade Controllers For PC, Switch, And Xbox</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/locke-key-keyhouse-comic-compendium-gets-massive-limited-time-discount/1100-6531565/">Locke &amp; Key Keyhouse Comic Compendium Gets Massive Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-mario-kart-mario-standard-kart-review-where-to-buy/1100-6530000/">Lego's Awesome New Mario Kart Display Set Is Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/joe-abercrombie-the-devils-new-fantasy-book-series-2025-amazon/1100-6531472/">First Book In Joe Abercrombie's New Fantasy Series Is Finally Here</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-optimus-prime-lego-set-restocked-and-20-off-at-amazon/1100-6509331/">Amazon Restocks Lego Transformers Optimus Prime, Offers Big Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-super-mario-bowser-muscle-car-amazon-deal-retiring-lego-set/1100-6531375/">PSA: Lego Bowser's Muscle Car Is Retiring - Save Big On 3 Mario Sets Before They're Gone</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-citizen/" data-ref-id="5000-154459">Star Citizen</a>, the spaceship-combat game with a never-ending crowdfunding campaign, is currently undergoing a wave of backlash from players. Developer Cloud Imperium Games recently rolled out components that improve ship movement that were originally exclusive to the real-money store--a change that has caused fans to revolt. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, CIG's addition of flight blades in a recent update, which improve ship maneuverability or speed, has caused significant anger among the community. The particular issue at hand here is that CIG rolled these out only to the Star Citizen Pledge Store, where the studio sells in-game items like ships, cosmetics, and upgrades.</p><p>Selling an item like flight blades isn't on its own unusual--the pledge store is a core method that CIG crowdfunds its game. However, Star Citizen has long had a norm of allowing players to purchase upgrades either with real money or with in-game currency (called aUEC). While the studio promised that they would be made purchasable by in-game currency later in the summer, they were launched early to players willing to shell out cash. Gating the flight blades exclusively behind a real-money paywall struck many fans as a bridge too far. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/introducing-flight-blades-shape-your-ship-s-behavi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Star Citizen forum thread announcing the flight blades</a> has accumulated over 2,000 replies, way more than the average thread, and most of these are quite negative. </p><p>"Selling performance altering modules and keeping them locked behind this paywall even for a short period is still the definition of pay to win and not ok CIG," the top-voted comment from user Vraxer declared. User Morphologis wrote, "So if we're now separating out new features into sellable website commodities, where does this go next? Exclusive Jump Gate keys to Nyx 3 months early? Special exclusive new mission coordinate keys? This is a step too far." </p><p>The fan revolt came so quickly and with such intensity that CIG had to post a revision of its approach to flight blades. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In this new thread</a>, which itself has garnered over 1,100 replies and a huge number of negative reactions, the studio admitted that it had "missed a step" due to "moving faster than ever" to complete a packed docket of game updates this year. Instead of launching them into timed exclusivity to the pledge store, CIG stated that it would delay the release of the components until later in the summer and launch them simultaneously for both real money and in-game currency. CIG also committed to concurrent releases in the future, stating, "For future gameplay kit introductions, we’ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one." </p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, this slight backtrack has not calmed the frustration of Star Citizen players. Many of whom have continued to express dismay and anger at the expansion of components for sale that are seen as "pay to win"--that is, components that significantly improve or otherwise alter the behavior of ships in normal gameplay situations. As the top-voted poster, SaltEMike, wrote, "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day." </p><p>Part of the reason why this change has caused such ire among fans is likely that Star Citizen has raised a tremendous amount of money from early adopters since it began its crowdfunding campaign back in 2013. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to its own website</a>, CIG has brought in well over $800 million, an astonishing sum for a game that is still technically in early access. Correspondingly, Star Citizen is considered one of the most expensive games ever made.</p><p>However, despite the game's astronomical price tag, CIG has had a rocky track record of development practices. Last year, reports claimed that employees at CIG were being forced to work brutally long hours and crunch seven days per week on the game and its first-person shooter spinoff, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>. </p>

The book goes behind the scenes of the making of each Heroes of Might and Magic game, charting its humble origins and how it evolved over the years to become a staple in the turn-based-fantasy genre. Alongside a breakdown of the Heroes of Might and Magic games, you can also explore never-before-seen art, documentation, and interviews with key members of the creative teams.</p>                      </div><p>Heroes of Might and Magic has had multiple games over the years, starting in 1995 when it spun off from the main Might and Magic series. The rights to the IP were originally held by New World Computing, which was later acquired by 3DO.</p><p>After 3DO closed down, these rights were then sold to Ubisoft, with the first game under new ownership being Heroes of Might and Magic 5. Following a lengthy hiatus after the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 7 in 2015, Ubisoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era/" data-ref-id="5000-640663">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</a>, which is being produced by Iratus: Lord of the Dead developer Unfrozen. The new game will be released later this year through Steam Early Access on PC.</p><p>For more cool collectibles, you can check out several other books at Dark Horse Direct focused on the art behind specific video games. These range from The Last of Us to Mass Effect, and several of them have been discounted recently.</p><p>Alternatively, you can also preorder jigsaw puzzles designed to celebrate the legacy of developer Naughty Dog.
