                <p>Between now and the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> next month, Battlefield Studios and its developers will be working to refine the game based on what was learned during the recent open beta test. Players have already shared their responses to the beta with some bitingly funny memes, including some commenting on the dominance of snipers and the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mm1g5r/enemy_sniper_spotted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">brightness of the glint reflecting off their scopes</a>. The Battlefield 6 team has seen those pics, and they think they're hilarious.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4568505-battlefieldenemysnipermeme.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4568505" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1536" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4568505-battlefieldenemysnipermeme.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4568505"></a><figcaption>A meme joking about how bright sniper rifle scope glints are in Battlefield 6, posted on Reddit's r/Battlefield community by user Leonardo-Caleum.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4568505-battlefieldenemysnipermeme.jpeg"></figure><p>Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently spoke with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> about the upcoming release. When asked about the memes, Buhl admitted to laughing at them while also taking their points to heart.</p><p>"I saw those ... I thought it was hilarious," said Buhl. "Obviously, we needed to fix some things and tune some things, so it was funny to see players react in a humorous way to those things, but also great to get that feedback and say, 'We need to tune down snipers or we need to change the glints so it's not likeâ€¦' you know? I saw those memes with the hillside just full of these giant glares."</p><p>Nickerson added that the design team shares the memes internally, and he praised the effort made by fans to address the issues of the game through humor.</p><p>"They're really, really funny, and they kind of magnify, 'Hey, we still have work to do,'" Nickerson said. "For example, with the sniper glint stuff, we knew it was too strong, so we stepped it back. We knew the bullet tracer effect was too strong, so we stepped it back ... At the end of the day, it keeps us honest. It keeps us, like, 'Hey, we still have work to do. There are things that players are, maybe, not vibing with or are vibing with in different capacities.' ... From a design standpoint and from the team, we love this stuff. The community is engaged; we are engaged."</p><p>In the same interview, Nickerson addressed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-battlefield-6-is-approaching-locked-vs-open-class-weapons/1100-6534752/" data-ref-id="1100-6534752"> the team's approach to open class weapons and locked weapons</a>, and shared the team's desire to let the players decide whether they wanted to play in matches with open weapons. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-skin-has-some-players-wanting-to-send-ea-a-message/1100-6534728/" data-ref-id="1100-6534728">recently leaked Battlefield 6 skin</a> had some players revolting against the non-traditional design that may be out of place with the game's realistic military aesthetics. Battlefield Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-studio-reacts-to-activisions-call-of-duty-skins-announcement/1100-6534734/" data-ref-id="1100-6534734">subsequently confirmed that its skins and cosmetics</a> will remain "gritty" and "grounded."</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-single-player-campaign-news-coming-soon/1100-6534583/" data-ref-id="1100-6534583">reveal the details about Battlefield 6's story mode</a> on September 26.

Battlefield 6 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-coming-to-switch-2-with-new-multiplayer-modes/1100-6534692/" data-ref-id="1100-6534692">Super Mario Bros. Wonder is getting a Switch 2 Edition</a>, and now fans think Nintendo may have accidentally revealed Rosalina will become new playable character.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer for the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder that premiered during the most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">Nintendo Direct</a> focused on the addition of Bellabel Park, a collection of multiplayer minigames exclusive to the Switch 2 version where players can either team up or compete against each other. One eagle-eyed fan, <a href="https://x.com/DynamoSuperX/status/1966516009780539646" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DynamoSuperX on X</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-unannounced-character-in-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-trailer?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c85b6db5e33600016f55c4&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), spotted a vs minigame icon at around the 2:00 minute mark in the trailer that clearly shows an image of Yoshi next to Rosalina, seemingly confirming her inclusion in the upcoming rerelease of the platformer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQNAdzmlauc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQNAdzmlauc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rosalina isn't in the original version of the game. However, Nintendo did state during the trailer that there would be additional new content coming to the Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but that it would share more details at a later date. It certainly seems like Rosalina might be one of the surprises Nintendo was looking to keep under wraps until closer to the game's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Her inclusion would make sense given Nintendo's all-in push for Super Mario Galaxy. Nintendo during its latest direct announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-october/1100-6534691/" data-ref-id="1100-6534691">remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a> are coming this year and that the name of Universal's Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, scheduled to release April 2026, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hits-theaters-in-april-2026-chris-pratt-returning-as-mario/1100-6534677/" data-ref-id="1100-6534677">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>. Rosalina was introduced in the first Super Mario Galaxy back in 2007, and fans can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/" data-ref-id="1100-6534724">preorder a physical version of Rosalina's storybook</a> from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meet Up In Bellabel Park is slated to release in 2026, joining a growing collection of Switch games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree/" data-ref-id="5000-632917">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" data-ref-id="5000-538660">Kirby and The Forgotten Land</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 Editions</a> that pack in exclusive content.</p>

                <p>There have been some off-the-wall year collaborations in the past year, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-beavis-and-butt-head-trailer-is-a-sight-to-behold/1100-6532887/" data-ref-id="1100-6532887">the Beavis and Butt-Head skins in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. However, developer Team Jade may have the wildest one of the year with the upcoming Delta Force x Saw crossover. In the teaser video, Saw's Jigsaw killer seemingly enters the world of this free-to-play first-person tactical shooter with a life or death ultimatum.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heyQ-uPTKyk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/heyQ-uPTKyk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the Saw films, the original Jigsaw killer, John Kramer, has been dead for almost two decades. And neither he nor his successors wore life-sized costumes based on Billy the Puppet. But the man behind Billy's mask in this clip certainly knows Kramer's modus operandi and his favorite catchphrases. It's only at the end of the video that he reveals himself as operator D-Wolf. This isn't the first time that Saw has crossed over into games, as Billy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-more-horror-legends-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526825/" data-ref-id="1100-6526825">appeared in Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-haunting-of-verdansk-zombies-jigsaw-night-map-more/1100-6483469/" data-ref-id="1100-6483469">Call of Duty</a>.</p><p>D-Wolf's Billy the Puppet skin will make its in-game debut on October 23--just in time for Halloween--alongside firearms and other items inspired by the Saw films. In the meantime, a new Delta Force season, War Ablaze, will begin on September 23. On that date, the game will introduce two new modes, Operation Warden and Operation Raven, as well as a new Warfare map called Fault. Additionally, a new operator, Raptor, will be added to the game's roster.</p><p>Last month, Delta Force reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/delta-force-surges-beyond-200000-concurrent-users-on-steam/1100-6534233/" data-ref-id="1100-6534233">a new peak of concurrent players on Steam</a> with 210,000. The game has steadily built up a following since its debut in December 2024. However, it appears that Delta Force is far more popular internationally than it is domestically, since it <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxa6qdhp3k24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">doesn't regularly show up in Circana's US engagement reports</a>.</p><p>As for the Saw movies, a new collection of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saw-movie-series-amazon-exclusive-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-editions-2025/1100-6534076/" data-ref-id="1100-6534076">Saw 4K Steelbook Editions are available for preorder on Amazon</a>. Earlier this summer, Blumhouse picked up a controlling stake in the Saw franchise, which will bring the original director, James Wan, back in a creative role for the first time since Saw 3 in 2006.</p>

Only five players field the pitch per team, and there are no fouls, offsides, or out of bounds. In fact, each pitch is enclosed in invisible walls that players can bounce the ball off of, making for a totally unique take on the popular sport. Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/" data-ref-id="1900-6418378">Rematch review</a> gave Rematch a 7/10, highlighting its unique skill-based gameplay, satisfying shooting mechanics, and the need for teamwork to win a match. "It's a different kind of football game, yet it's intuitive, and the allure of improving your skill level is captivating," wrote critic Richard Wakeling.</p><p>If you're looking for more arcade sports games like Rematch, the fast-paced basketball video game NBA Bounce launches on consoles and PC on September 26. This cooperative 4v4 basketball game is designed for players of all ages, and lets you create custom players for your favorite NBA team or even play as each team's mascot.

The Persona 5 skins for Overwatch 2 make the game's heroes look exactly as you expect them to, so much so that it is actually a little difficult to realize what hero is underneath the costume. There are, however, a few flourishes, such as rose petals falling from Mercy's wings and Wuyang's staff evoking Joker's Persona Arsene.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-new-support-hero-wuyang-would-fit-right-in-on-avatar-the-last-airbender/1100-6533909/" data-ref-id="1100-6533909">Wuyang is Overwatch 2's newest support hero</a> and as such doesn't have many cosmetics to choose from just yet, so it's nice that he is featured prominently as part of the crossover. Mercy, on the other hand, is one of the game's most popular characters and is often featured in crossovers, so her donning the look of Panther is a bit of a no brainer. Blizzard hasn't released the exact prices for the skins just yet, but expect them to be similar to that of previous crossovers, which usually cost around 2,800 ($28) Overwatch Coins per skin bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568295"></a><figcaption>Artwork created for the Overwatch 2 x Persona 5 collab by Atlus artist Shigenori Soejima.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4568295-ow2_x_phantom_thieves_key_art_16x9.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Outside of new skins, a few of Persona 5's visual flourishes will also make their way into Overwatch 2's menus, including a new piece of key art from Atlus character artist Shigenori Soejima. A Phantom Thieves-inspired overlay will also appear when viewing the Persona 5 cosmetics in the game's shop, a first for a collab, according to Blizzard.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't keen on opening their wallets to the Phantom Thieves, Overwatch 2 collabs usually bring some freebies in the form of sprays, weapon charms, and player icons for those who complete various challenges. Overwatch 2's Persona 5 crossover will be live September 16-30.</p>
