                <p>Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has made a name for himself as an actor over the last decade, but now he's moving into the video game space as a producer. Bautista and Titan1Studios have agreed to partner up to bring Cat Assassin to life as a new media franchise including an upcoming video game.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://gamerant.com/cat-assassin-game-dave-bautista-stray-neo-noir-franchise-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, Cat Assassin was created by Steve Lerner, the writer of the critically acclaimed indie game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-review-nine-lives/1900-6417917/" data-ref-id="1900-6417917">Stray</a>. While that title put players in control of an adorable cat in a city of robots, Cat Assassin's lead character, Hugh, is considerably less cuddly. He's described as "a skilled assassin navigating a chaotic world of warring cartels and corrupt power players." Presumably that's a role that Bautista may be interested in playing, but the announcement doesn't specify his involvement as an actor.</p><p>Cat Assassin takes place in a "neo-noir city populated by anthropomorphic felines." The video game is being planned as a stealth-action game with dark humor. The announcement notes that the Cat Assassin game is inspired by Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Sifu.</p><p>Bautista's Dogbone Entertainment production company is also developing Cat Assassin as a potential animated series and a feature film. Further details about their plans for the franchise and the upcoming game aren't currently known.</p><p>After wrapping his decade plus as Drax the Destroyer in the MCU, Bautista has expressed his interest in starring as Marcus Fenix in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Gears of War</a> movie in development at Netflix.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Players have discovered the information <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> gives about the stats of its character and karts isn't entirely true, as testing certain combinations of characters and vehicles have produced some surprising results.</p><p>Just as in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8</a>, Mario Kart World displays basic character and kart information like top speed, acceleration, weight, and handling. These stats are affected by the size of the characters, which are categorized into different unofficial weight classes. Extremely small or light characters, like all of the game's baby characters as well as some others, will have higher acceleration and lower top speeds, while heavy characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong will have higher top speeds but lower acceleration. The game doesn't tell players this outright, but it can be gleaned by selecting the same kart with different characters and seeing how the stat graph changes or stays the same.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_j7KZJbAbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_j7KZJbAbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>However, there are seemingly even more hidden stats that the game doesn't tell players about. As highlighted in a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@svcTyler" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">svcTyler</a> on YouTube, it appears some character and kart combinations are simply better than others in specific situations, despite the in-game stat graph showing that they should be identical. According to the video, certain characters and karts secretly perform better on certain types of terrain. Wario, for example, goes faster on paved tracks, while characters like Cow go faster on dirt roads. That means even though Wario and Waluigi are in same weight class, and even if they use the same kart, Wario will always be faster when driving on a normal road.</p><p>Since Nintendo is unlikely to ever give players the data they want outright, more testing will need to be done in the days and weeks ahead to learn which characters and karts excel in which situations. It's a fascinating revelation that adds an interesting wrinkle when it comes to selecting what character and kart to use, as the answer to what is best will depend on the track you're racing on. The question still remains why Nintendo doesn't just put all this secret information in-game for everyone to see, but at least it gives hardcore Mario Kart World players something to pursue in their quest for top times.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World review</a>, we said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch game</a> expands on almost everything that made Mario Kart 8 such a success, providing a "fun and rewarding kart racing experience that's easy to understand" while still providing "enough mechanical nuance to reward veteran kart racers."</p><p>Secret character stats aren't the only thing Mario Kart World doesn't tell players. It also doesn't disclose <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/" data-ref-id="1100-6532291">how to unlock Mirror Mode</a> or that you can actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">dodge Blue Shells using the game's new rewind feature</a>.</p>

                <p>PvP is a big part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's newly released survival MMO based on Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi series, and some players have already found a busted strategy that the developers are looking to fix "ASAP."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening released on June 5 for those who paid for the game's pricier editions (or June 10 for everyone else), and some players have already reached its PvP-focused endgame--the Deep Desert. It's there where the game's most precious resource, Spice, is found, and where players duke it out in large-scale PvP to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">As some players have learned the hard way, however, coming out on top can be quite literal, as a new meta involving the game's flying Ornithopter vehicles is seeing helpless players crushed from above over and over again. One player took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dune: Awakening subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and posted a video of their plight. The video shows user Bombe18 repeatedly crushed by an Ornithopter crashing into the ground. Every time Bombe18 self-revives, they are crushed again, and soon a second Ornithopter shows up to make Bombe18's life even more miserable.</p><p dir="ltr">The video prompted a response from Funcom's Joel Bylos, who responded to the video by stating "Sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP." Bylos didn't go into more detail on what exactly the fix would entail, but players on Reddit seem to agree that Ornithopters should be taking damage from ramming into the ground at high speeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening does give players tools to deal with vehicles, such as explosive weaponry. Players being divebombed by Ornithopters could also use a vehicle of their own to try and escape or hit back. That being said, flying vehicles able to crash into the ground with no concern for their own well-being does seem like an issue that needs to be addressed, so it's good to see Funcom is paying close attention.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to do their own Ornithopter diving runs, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">Dune: Awakening guide on how to unlock and craft vehicles</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-beginner-tips-to-help-you-survive-arrakis-in-dune-awakening/2900-6645/" data-ref-id="2900-6645">beginner tips for surviving on Arrakis</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful.

                <p>IO Interactive has teased more than their upcoming James Bond game in a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJ-bRUXBCRc&amp;t=605s&amp;ab_channel=GameSpot" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot interview.</a> Studio CEO Hakan Abrak briefly mentioned that their sixth original IP is currently a previously confirmed fantasy project.</p><p>"The passion and being able to pour some of yourself into this is extremely important for us creatively," Abrak said on GameSpot's Summer Games Fest livestream. "IO has done--we've really been blessed--five original IPs from the ground up, throughout the years. We're doing our sixth which is a fantasy project."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>
