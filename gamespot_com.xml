                <p>When player housing arrives in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>, players will be retroactively rewarded for past achievements in the form of housing decor, with Blizzard stating "all the time spent in Azeroth is worth something."</p><p dir="ltr">In a new <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24196547" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Blizzard continues to pull back the veil on WoW's long-awaited player housing system, confirming that players will be able to earn housing decor in a number of different ways. Common items like chairs, shelfs, beds, etc. will be widely available from vendors, quests, or other players via the auction house.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Some decor, however, will take more time or effort to unlock. Blizzard described these as "investment" items that may require more time or a significant cost to earn. Housing decor can also come in the form of "Trophies," rewards from long-term achievements or completing specific feats that require skillful play, with Blizzard comparing them to current Mythic+ or raid rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard confirmed that new decor rewards tied to past achievements or feats will be rewarded retroactively the first time a player logs in, and that some decor will be integrated into past expansions for players to unlock using expansion-specific systems or currencies.</p><p dir="ltr">Professions from each expansion, too, will play an important role. All non-gathering professions will be able to craft items for housing, with Blizzard laying out a few examples. Blacksmiths will be able to make objects made primarily of metal, enchanters will be able to create magical objects, and jewelcrafters will craft stone-related objects and gem-studded decorations. Decor from previous expansions will require corresponding reagents and the relevant profession level from that expansion, giving players more reasons to go back into the game's past.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of decorating a home properly shouldn't be difficult, but it does want to give players some "reach-goals" throughout the game to shoot for.</p><p dir="ltr">"That said, it should be easily possible to kit out your home on day one to strike the vibe you're looking for without too much effort," Blizzard said. "Your decor journey should start out awesome and continue to be that all along the way."</p><p dir="ltr">Other details shared by Blizzard include that decor items are shared across a player's entire account, so if they have four chairs total and use three of them in the house for one of their characters, other characters will only have one left to use. Some items will also be limited to how many copies players can have, with an example being that it doesn't make sense to have nine copies of Onyxia's head mounted on the wall.</p><p dir="ltr">For WoW players looking for something more to do ahead of housing's arrival, Blizzard hinted that leveling up professions from previous expansions, as well as completing meta-achievements, might be goals worth pursuing for those looking to get a head start on decorating their homes.</p><p dir="ltr">This is just the latest glimpse at WoW's player housing system, which still does not have a release date but is said to be coming alongside the arrival of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">MMORPG's next expansion, Midnight</a>. Blizzard previously stressed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">housing in WoW will be available to everyone</a> and won't come with "exorbitant requirements." It also revealed the systems players will be using to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/" data-ref-id="1100-6530083">decorate their homes</a>, as well as how its neighborhood housing system will work.</p>

                <p>EA and DICE recently conducted the latest Battlefield Labs testing period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and despite participants agreeing to not share footage online, that's exactly what's happened. Lots of new gameplay videos from the alpha test recently made their way online, and the footage looks pretty impressive.</p><p>Among other things, the videos show off Battlefield 6's new destruction elements, while we also see player piloting a jet, zipping across a massive map. Other videos show off some of the game's numerous ground-based vehicles. You can check out the footage in some of the social media clips below.</p><p>Battlefield 6 gameplay footage has been leaking all over the place, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982">dating back to the first Battlefield Labs test earlier this year.</a> Responding to the leaks, a top Battlefield boss reminded fans that early alpha footage is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-discusses-leaks-and-how-fan-feedback-isnt-everything/1100-6530304/" data-ref-id="1100-6530304">not necessarily representative of the final product.</a> And while DICE encourages fans to submit feedback, the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-boss-discusses-leaks-and-how-fan-feedback-isnt-everything/1100-6530304/" data-ref-id="1100-6530304">has its own development plans, too.</a></p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to possibly get into a future test. Battlefield 6, or whatever the game might be called, has been rumored to release in Fall 2025, but EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">it'll be out by March 2026</a>. CEO Andrew Wilson recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sounds-like-battlefield-6s-release-date-will-avoid-gta-6/1100-6529258/" data-ref-id="1100-6529258">EA could shift the game to potentially avoid a clash with GTA 6.</a></p><p>In addition to multiplayer, the next Battlefield game will have a single-player component developed by Motive and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">unannounced mode from Ripple Effect that is rumored to be the return of Portal mode.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 will be the first new entry since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that had a poor launch and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-failed-to-reach-expectations-but-ea-still-had-its-best-q3-in-company-history/1100-6500197/" data-ref-id="1100-6500197">ended up selling below expectations for EA.</a> DICE management blamed the poor results on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-strayed-a-little-too-far-from-what-makes-the-series-fun-ea-exec-says/1100-6507599/undefined/" data-ref-id="1100-6507599">developers working from home during the height of COVID</a>, among other things.</p>
