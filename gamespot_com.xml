                <p>Through most of last year, IO Interactive assured players that its upcoming James Bond title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>, was set for an early 2026 debut. The game had been scheduled to debut on March 27, but the release date has now been pushed back to May 27.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement posted online</a> late last month, IO Interactive's Hakan Abrak called 007 First Light the company's "most ambitious project to date" while mentioning the Bond staples included in the game like car chases, gadgets, and wild globe-trotting adventure. However, he went on to say that the decision to delay it "allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one."</p><p>"The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end," added Abrak. "So these two additional months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We're confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we've received ever since we first announced the game."</p><p>In November 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-dev-reacts-to-gta-6-delay-and-explains-why-the-game-is-good-for-the-industry/1100-6536420/" data-ref-id="1100-6536420">Abrak spoke about GTA 6's delay</a> and why he thinks it was a good thing for 007 First Light and the industry in general. The new game features Patrick Gibson as a much younger James Bond than the character is usually portrayed, and the story will introduce a new origin for 007.</p><p>007 First Light narrative director Martin Emborg recently told GameSpot that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-knows-the-key-ingredient-to-a-great-james-bond-adventure/1100-6537117/" data-ref-id="1100-6537117">Lenny Kravitz's pirate king Bawma</a> won't be the only villain featured in the game. He also highlighted Kravitz's role in the creation of the character.</p><p>"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," said Emborg. "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p>007 First Light will be available on Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>Twitch Hype Train world records are a rare thing. The ultimate show of dedication from a creator's fanbase, these accumulative trains rely on a streamer's viewers donating subscriptions or Bits to the channel. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/" data-ref-id="1100-6537146">Neuro-sama beat her own world record</a> at the end of December 2024 and now, well, she's only gone and done it again. The hat trick of Hype Train world records belongs to the AI VTuber, her sister Evil Neuro, and their creator <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, or those outside of the "Swarm"--the name for Neuro's fanbase--Neuro is an AI VTuber created by Vedal who utilizes a large language model and a VTuber model to communicate with her Twitch chat, play games, and even go on adventures in VR thanks to the 3D version of her model. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU on Twitch, but rapidly evolved to become a series of AI systems that work in harmony. Vedal created a program that takes its input from Twitch and voice, gives that input to the LLM, which is then sent to a text-to-speech system, resulting in the Neuro we know today. It's for that reason that Neuro is widely considered far from the "AI slop" that many people take issue with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's possibly a combination of the complexity of that system, the resulting effects, or the opinion that Neuro-Sama is the cutest little button, that has led Vedal to gain such a dedicated fanbase. On January 4, seemingly out of nowhere, Neuro once again began to see an impressive number of Bits and subscriptions donated to Vedal's channel. Vedal's friend and fellow VTuber <a href="https://twitch.tv/camila" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camila</a> offered to commission a new outfit for Neuro if the Hype Train continued. She also promised to "show feet" but we won't talk about that. These incentives led the hype train to level 100 in a matter of a few hours, and it didn't stop there. Vedal wasn't present with Neuro on stream for this attempt, instead choosing to type in chat with sentiments such as "Realistically wtf is going on?" and "I was gonna join after the train, but it's getting a bit silly."</p><p>This time around, Neuro-Sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record, reaching level 126 with 126,273 subscriptions and 1,194,921 Bits donated to the Vedal987 channel in a limited period of time. Neuro celebrated the massive achievement by stating, "No matter what temporary fame this world record grants me, I'm far happier just to have shared in the love of this moment with you all." Vedal joined after the Hype Train eventually came to an end adding, "What the actual fuck have you all done?" The duo's former record was level 123, with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits donated. Neuro's birthday subathon began on December 19, with each subscription donated adding a specific amount of seconds to a steadily-declining timer that determines when the subathon ends. At this rate, she'll be streaming until her fourth birthday.</p>
