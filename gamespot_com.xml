                <p>Nintendo has announced an Animal Crossing collaboration with popular footwear company Crocs, and the results are pretty much exactly what you'd expect.</p><p>The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Nintendo+Collabs+With+Crocs+For+Animal+Crossing+Footwear&amp;fnauthor=billygivens&amp;fndate=2025-07-08+09%3A41%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-08+10%3A34%3A15&amp;fnarticle_id=6533032&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.crocs.com%252Fc%252Fcast-of-characters%252Fanimal-crossing&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnintendo-collabs-with-crocs-for-animal-crossing-footwear%2F1100-6533032%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Animal Crossing-themed Crocs</a>, which are set to launch August 26, will be available in both kids' and adult sizes. The shoes sport a green forest background on the top segment and a water scene on the bottom inspired by the game's locales. A variety of Animal Crossing Jibbitz charms come pre-installed on the shoes, including beloved characters like K.K. Slider, Isabelle, Tom Nook, and Timmy &amp; Tommy--but additional charms can be purchased separately on the website.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4528320-crocs.png" data-ref-id="1300-4528320" data-ratio="0.56048387096774" data-width="1488" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4528320-crocs.png" data-ref-id="1300-4528320"></a><figcaption>These Animal Crossing-themed Crocs will be available August 26.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/679/6794662/4528320-crocs.png"></figure><p>"Since its debut in 2001, the games have been enjoyed by millions of players worldwide, becoming a cherished title for fans of all ages," Nintendo said in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/crocs-launches-first-ever-collaboration-with-animal-crossing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement</a>. The company feels that the shoes will "help you step into a relaxing, nature-filled world with your favorite characters right at your feet."</p><p>Pricing seems to be a bit confusing for now, though. The Crocs website lists the prices as $55 and $85 for kids' and adult sizes, respectively, while Nintendo lists the adult sizes at $70 in the reveal. We'll update this if we receive clarification.</p><p>These charming Animal Crossing Crocs will be available for purchase at Crocs online and retail stores, partner stores, and other authorized Crocs retailers when they launch on August 26, 2025.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> developer VOID Interactive faced backlash in June for "censoring" the game to comply with the console certification process. The developer has defended its choices as not fundamentally altering Ready or Not's violence or its grim tone, but instead making minimal alterations to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ready-or-not-censoring-content-to-get-certified-for-console-release-upsetting-fans/1100-6532917/">ensure compliance with the requirements of other platforms</a>. In the wake of the backlash, VOID Interactive has released a new statement that clarifies exactly what content has been altered, going as far as to include "before" and "after" images to illustrate changes.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/526472884483263337?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> emphasizes that no major changes have come to Ready or Not's shootouts. Players can still sever the limbs of foes with gunfire and it still includes plenty of blood and guts. However, players can no longer dismember the dead bodies of enemies. Elsewhere, the update removes nudity, softens an allusion to child sexual-abuse material, and replaces a convulsing NPC with a sleeping one. The statement elaborates, "The effects of gore and violence -- key to the game’s immersive realism -- have not been toned down...we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations -- no further."</p><p dir="ltr">The statement has not halted the backlash. Portions of the game's community has continued to review bomb Ready or Not. While the overall rating is steady at "very positive," recent reviews have plummeted to "mostly negative." Multiple reviewers claim the changes have had a dramatic effect on the game's tone. One says, "It now feels like just another generic tactical shooter, weighed down by clunky AI and stripped of the atmosphere that set it apart." Other reviews find the controversy incredibly silly, with one reviewer advising the aggrieved to "touch grass."</p><p dir="ltr"><a dir="ltr" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Ready or Not</a> is still on discount as part of the Steam Summer Sale. The base game is available for $25 and a bundle including DLC is $39. The game comes to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on July 15.</p>

                <p>One of the most annoying parts of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> endgame may soon see changes, as Blizzard has said it's looking to "fix" boss fight immunity phases.</p><p dir="ltr">In a response to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (via <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-boss-immunity-phases-might-soon-be-a-thing-of-the-past-377626?utm_source=bsky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=250807&amp;utm_content=d4_immunity" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>) asking for Blizzard to remove the immunity phases from endgame bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and the Harbinger of Hatred, Diablo director of content and social marketing Adam Fletcher had a short-and-to-the-point answer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">There are plans to fix this up.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1938722534490546603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"There are plans to fix this up," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">Long immunity phases where bosses become invulnerable are currently a pain point in Diablo 4's endgame post-Season 8, which made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">bosses harder but also more rewarding</a>. Even though a player may be capable of dealing enough damage to kill a Tormented boss in just a few blows, there are instead multiple periods where players are forced to endure various mechanics while the boss becomes invincible for a set amount of time.</p><p dir="ltr">The immunity phases are especially annoying (and have been basically since the game's launch) for the Echo of Lilith boss fight due to her attacks causing a stacking debuff that will eventually one-shot players. Add on the fact that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-8-players-are-fed-up-with-its-bugged-lilith-boss-fight/1100-6532596/" data-ref-id="1100-6532596">Lilith fight has been bugged</a> recently so that she sometimes never leaves her invulnerability phase, and players are largely fed up with having to wait to deal damage despite being strong enough to kill bosses outright.</p><p dir="ltr">What specific changes to Diablo 4's endgame bosses, or when they may arrive, are still a mystery, as Fletcher didn't elaborate further. However, Fletcher recently had this to say on social media following Blizzard's recent Diablo 4 Season 9 Campfire Chat livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just know, your warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1938720086338216264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "The team has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more. We will share more as we get closer."</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 9 started July 1 and will run through September 23. Blizzard has not yet outlined more concrete plans for Season 10, but players can hope that some of the bigger changes Fletcher is alluding to will arrive around then.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, players have recently discovered an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-now-has-a-very-easy-to-replicate-infinite-damage-bug/1100-6533026/" data-ref-id="1100-6533026">easy Diablo 4 infinite-damagebug</a> for the Sorcerer that will likely be fixed soon. In addition to changes for Diablo 4, Blizzard has also teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cryptic-diablo-2-anniversary-tweet-is-giving-fans-hope-for-new-content/1100-6532876/" data-ref-id="1100-6532876">Diablo 2 news</a>, which fans are hoping is new content for the classic ARPG.</p>
