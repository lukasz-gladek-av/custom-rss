                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-citizen/" data-ref-id="5000-154459">Star Citizen</a>, the spaceship-combat game with a never-ending crowdfunding campaign, is currently undergoing a wave of backlash from players. Developer Cloud Imperium Games recently rolled out components that improve ship movement that were originally exclusive to the real-money store--a change that has caused fans to revolt. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/after-raising-over-usd800-million-from-its-community-star-citizens-developer-delays-the-release-of-a-new-ship-upgrade-as-players-baulk-at-having-to-pay-for-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, CIG's addition of flight blades in a recent update, which improve ship maneuverability or speed, has caused significant anger among the community. The particular issue at hand here is that CIG rolled these out only to the Star Citizen Pledge Store, where the studio sells in-game items like ships, cosmetics, and upgrades.</p><p>Selling an item like flight blades isn't on its own unusual--the pledge store is a core method that CIG crowdfunds its game. However, Star Citizen has long had a norm of allowing players to purchase upgrades either with real money or with in-game currency (called aUEC). While the studio promised that they would be made purchasable by in-game currency later in the summer, they were launched early to players willing to shell out cash. Gating the flight blades exclusively behind a real-money paywall struck many fans as a bridge too far. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/3/thread/introducing-flight-blades-shape-your-ship-s-behavi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Star Citizen forum thread announcing the flight blades</a> has accumulated over 2,000 replies, way more than the average thread, and most of these are quite negative. </p><p>"Selling performance altering modules and keeping them locked behind this paywall even for a short period is still the definition of pay to win and not ok CIG," the top-voted comment from user Vraxer declared. User Morphologis wrote, "So if we're now separating out new features into sellable website commodities, where does this go next? Exclusive Jump Gate keys to Nyx 3 months early? Special exclusive new mission coordinate keys? This is a step too far." </p><p>The fan revolt came so quickly and with such intensity that CIG had to post a revision of its approach to flight blades. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/flight-blade-feedback-update" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In this new thread</a>, which itself has garnered over 1,100 replies and a huge number of negative reactions, the studio admitted that it had "missed a step" due to "moving faster than ever" to complete a packed docket of game updates this year. Instead of launching them into timed exclusivity to the pledge store, CIG stated that it would delay the release of the components until later in the summer and launch them simultaneously for both real money and in-game currency. CIG also committed to concurrent releases in the future, stating, "For future gameplay kit introductions, weâ€™ll ensure these items are obtainable in-game on day one." </p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, this slight backtrack has not calmed the frustration of Star Citizen players. Many of whom have continued to express dismay and anger at the expansion of components for sale that are seen as "pay to win"--that is, components that significantly improve or otherwise alter the behavior of ships in normal gameplay situations. As the top-voted poster, SaltEMike, wrote, "This is a bandaid to calm people down, but the root issue here is that you continue to sell more and more items in the game that have a wider impact on what a player would do day to day." </p><p>Part of the reason why this change has caused such ire among fans is likely that Star Citizen has raised a tremendous amount of money from early adopters since it began its crowdfunding campaign back in 2013. <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/en/funding-goals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to its own website</a>, CIG has brought in well over $800 million, an astonishing sum for a game that is still technically in early access. Correspondingly, Star Citizen is considered one of the most expensive games ever made.</p><p>However, despite the game's astronomical price tag, CIG has had a rocky track record of development practices. Last year, reports claimed that employees at CIG were being forced to work brutally long hours and crunch seven days per week on the game and its first-person shooter spinoff, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-citizens-single-player-game-squadron-42-delay/1100-6444340/" data-ref-id="1100-6444340">Squadron 42</a>. </p>

The book goes behind the scenes of the making of each Heroes of Might and Magic game, charting its humble origins and how it evolved over the years to become a staple in the turn-based-fantasy genre. Alongside a breakdown of the Heroes of Might and Magic games, you can also explore never-before-seen art, documentation, and interviews with key members of the creative teams.</p>                      </div><p>Heroes of Might and Magic has had multiple games over the years, starting in 1995 when it spun off from the main Might and Magic series. The rights to the IP were originally held by New World Computing, which was later acquired by 3DO.</p><p>After 3DO closed down, these rights were then sold to Ubisoft, with the first game under new ownership being Heroes of Might and Magic 5. Following a lengthy hiatus after the release of Heroes of Might and Magic 7 in 2015, Ubisoft recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/heroes-of-might-and-magic-olden-era/" data-ref-id="5000-640663">Heroes of Might and Magic: Olden Era</a>, which is being produced by Iratus: Lord of the Dead developer Unfrozen. The new game will be released later this year through Steam Early Access on PC.</p><p>For more cool collectibles, you can check out several other books at Dark Horse Direct focused on the art behind specific video games.

                <p>According to Yoji Fujito, the producer and director of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xi/" data-ref-id="5000-967">Final Fantasy XI</a>, ongoing support for the game could have ended in 2024. Player interest was high enough that Square Enix ultimately decided not to stop supporting the MMO, though, and a series of new updates is expected throughout this spring and summer.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI was the first MMO in the long-running RPG series, and it first launched for PS2 in Japan on May 16, 2002. Live-service support for the MMO, which is now played on PC, has continued ever since. Final Fantasy XI, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xi-review/1900-6083638/" data-ref-id="1900-6083638">GameSpot reviewed all the way back in 2003</a>, has survived Square's merger with Enix, the disastrous launch and lauded rebirth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, and all of the other changes in the MMO space that have happened in the 23 years since its launch. It's not the most popular MMO, but it has a dedicated and passionate fanbase.</p><p>That dedicated fanbase ultimately saved the game. In an interview with <a href="https://dengekionline.com/article/202505/42194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dengeki Online</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-considered-ending-final-fantasy-11-in-2024-but-player-interest-was-high-enough-to-keep-it-alive-even-after-20-years/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton Media</a>, Fujito explained that Square Enix had previously considered ending support for Final Fantasy XI by 2024 following the end of The Voracious Resurgence storyline.</p><p>"There was a real possibility that 2024 would be the year updates would come to an end, with the game shifting into a so-called maintenance mode, where only system upkeep would be performed," Fujito said. "We thought, if The Voracious Resurgence wrapped up and FFXI clearly started losing its momentum, then maybe we really should prepare to end it. But that didnâ€™t happen. I took this as a sign that we should keep running the game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENQMmY3jmkk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ENQMmY3jmkk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultimately, Fujito says the fact that Final Fantasy XI has continued to receive "a lot of support" from players is the reason why Square Enix is still committed to supporting it now. A series of updates for Year 23 of service was recently revealed too, including a new High-Tier Mission Battlefield called The Orb's Radiance, a new Master Trial called Wing of War, the ability to pay to change your character's race, gender, face, hair, and size, gamepad configuration support, and more.</p><p>Final Fantasy XI is available on PC, and support for it does not seem to be ending anytime soon.</p>
