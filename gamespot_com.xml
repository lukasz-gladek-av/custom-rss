                <p>It was the Pokemon World Championships over the weekend, and with that means plenty of announcements. If you're a bit of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> aficionado, then you'll probably be excited to hear that Mega Evolution will be coming to the mobile card-collecting game later this fall. The Pokemon Company shared a trailer announcing the news, where it also showed off three Mega Pokemon cards that will be available to pull whenever the set drops.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is the "ever-fluffy" Mega Altaria. This one is a psychic-type card with 190HP, and it has just one move, Mega Harmony, which does a minimum of 40 damage, and increases by 30 points for every benched Pokemon you have.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vS2fnu49pw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Then there's the "ghastly" Mega Gyarados, a water-type card with 210HP, and again a singular move, Mega Blaster. This move deals 140 damage, and your opponent has to discard the top 3 cards of your opponent's deck.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, there's Mega Blaziken, a fire-type card which also has 210HP, and uses the move Mega Burning, which deals 120 damage. You can also discard one fire energy card from it to burn your opponent's active Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Each Mega Pokemon also comes with a Mega Evolution EX rule, which states that when your Mega Evolved Pokemon card is knocked out, your opponent gets three points.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no word on when the Mega Evolution season will kick off outside of this fall, so you'll have to keep your eyes peeled in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also announced during this year's Pokemon Worlds that next year's championships <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-champions-will-be-the-main-vgc-game-at-the-pokemon-world-championships-in-2026/1100-6534029/">will use the upcoming Pokemon Champions instead of any of the main series games</a>. As well as that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/" data-ref-id="1100-6534031">getting a new mode that sees four players battling each other at the same time</a>.</p>

                <p>Although Pokemon battles have been traditionally fought between two Pokemon trainers, Pokemon Legends: Z-A is increasing the number with a new mode.</p><p dir="ltr">A new trailer introduces the Z-A Battle Club, a mode that pits up to four players in free-for-all battles. The trainer who defeats the most Pokemon in three minutes is crowned the winner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y30vuKRtYPw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer is set in an arena in Lumiose City at nighttime and gives an idea of the different tactics players can have and how fortunes can quickly change within the time limit. Just like the core Pokemon Legends experience, battles take place in real-time, so there are power-up items around the arena that players can run and collect, or you can choose to play it safe, or go on the offensive.</p><p dir="ltr">As the match progresses, it's also possible Pokemon to undergo a Mega Evolution and unleash more powerful attacks, which can be effective on multiple Pokemon. Trainers whose Pokemon have fainted can still make a comeback by switching out Pokemon. The video concludes with a Dragonite that Mega-Evolves in the last ten seconds of the match before unleashing a move so powerful it knocks out three opponents at once to clinch the win.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Legends: Z-A is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch on October 16, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 console launch bundle</a> also available to preorder for $500.</p><p dir="ltr">At a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A hands-on</a>, we said, "It seems like a solid foundation that will give players a new way to experience Pokemon battles that have become so familiar.</p>
