                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/news/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> launches soon for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, capping off a big year for the franchise. The first mainline Ninja Gaiden in many years, this new entry in the series has been co-developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, and it officially launches on October 21. Global launch times for Ninja Gaiden 4 have been officially confirmed, and if you're in the US, you won't have to worry too much about FOMO during working hours because the game will go live toward the later part of the day on October 20.</p><p>For the middle part of the world, those times translate to a <em>very </em>early launch on October 21, so if you're in London or Paris, at least you can wake up and start playing right away if you preloaded the game. Here's a quick breakdown of the exact Ninja Gaiden 4 launch times across the globe. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adding-these-12-games-soon/2900-7116/" data-ref-id="2900-7116">Ninja Gaiden 4 will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 release times</h2><h3>Monday, October 20, 2025</h3><ul><li>5 PM PT</li><li>6 PM CST</li><li>8 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CST</li></ul><h3>Tuesday, October 21, 2025</h3><ul><li>1 AM BST</li><li>2 AM CEST</li><li>9 AM KST</li><li>9 AM JST</li><li>11 AM AEDT</li><li>1 PM NZDT</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662"></a><figcaption>Ninja Gaiden 4 global release times</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg"></figure><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 preloading times and install sizes</h2><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 should be a relatively quick download--depending on your home internet connection--as sizes range from 36.82GB on Xbox Series X|S consoles to 54.9GB on PC. PS5 users can expect the smallest download here, as the game clocks in at 23.55GB in size. These are just the install sizes, and they're likely to change with any potential updates or future patches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4 preorders are still live</a> and come with several bonuses.</p><p>Following the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 follows Ryu Hayabusa and a new protagonist, Yakumo, as they explore the underworld of Tokyo. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers," Jessica Cogswell wrote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-is-the-ninja-gaiden-game-youre-hoping-it-will-be/1100-6533763/">in her preview of the game</a>. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be."</p><p>While the series has a reputation for being challenging, this new entry in the franchise looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-could-be-the-easiest-or-toughest-game-in-the-series-to-date/1100-6535013/">it could be the most approachable yet</a> thanks to several accessibility options. If you're looking to breeze through the storyline and feel like a master ninja, you can tone down the difficulty for your playthrough, or if you're feeling masochistic, you can dial it up to a sadistic level that's designed to feel purposefully unfair.</p>

                <p>Late last month, Electronic Arts confirmed that it had struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">a $55 billion deal</a> to go private under new ownership including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There are a lot of unanswered questions about what this means for EA and the industry at large, but now two US Senators are raising the potential "foreign influence" Saudi Arabia could enact with EA under its control.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren--both of whom are Democrats--co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about whether Saudi Arabia will take over EA's editorial independence if the deal is approved. As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/senators-warn-saudi-arabias-acquisition-of-ea-will-be-used-for-foreign-influence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, they also suggested that Saudi Arabia's ownership may rise to the level of a "national security" risk.</p><p>"The deal's potential to expand and strengthen Saudi foreign influence in the United States is compounded by the national security risks raised by the Saudi government's access to and unchecked influence over the sensitive personal information collected from EA's millions of users, its development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the company's product design and direction."</p><p>Saudi Arabia's PIF has spent a lot of money to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">invest in multiple video game companies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/" data-ref-id="1100-6511622">including Nintendo</a>. The country also struck a 12-year pact with the IOC to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a> for multiple events. Saudi Arabia has been accused of numerous human rights violations as well as the 2018 assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Investing in video game companies and other diversified holdings has been interpreted as a way for the country to whitewash its image on the international stage.</p>

That's certainly the case in new clip posted by Rebs Gaming.</p><p>In the sequence, the Battlefield 6 player XxOsiris187xX ejects from a jet high above the battlefield and just as they go to open their parachute, another jet appears below them. The player lands on this jet, walks to the front, dome-shots the pilot, and then gets into the hijacked jet to make a getaway. It's seriously impressive stuff that you need to see to believe--take a look for yourself in the clip below.</p><p>There have been numerous astonishing Battlefield 6 clips that have emerged following the game's big launch on October 10. In another clip, the professional player FaZe Scope uses a drone to vault himself into the sky, then whips out a sniper rifle and takes out a helicopter. Take a look:</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels. It remains to be seen if Battlefield Studios can keep the momentum and engagement going, but the company has seemingly laid a strong foundation to build on. </p><p>Next up for Battlefield 6 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">launch of Season 1 on October 28</a>, and that's also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">the game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch. </a></p><p>As for the competitive landscape, EA veteran Patrick Soderlund's Embark Studios is launching its new multiplayer shooter Arc Raiders on October 30, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14.</a></p>

This is a joke, and yet it's very real at the same time, as seen in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgpXBGbeM4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="68">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SgpXBGbeM4U?start=68" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This isn't just merch," reads the description on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/15/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-couch-panion-sweepstakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. "This isn't just a plush. This is a lifestyle choice. A statement piece. A co-pilot for every late-night quest and awkward snack run. It's satire you can hug--and proof that The Outer Worlds 2 lives beyond the game."</p><p>The Moon Man Couch-Panion is three feet tall and includes a popcorn bucket holder in its head, weird stress-ball squishy hands, and straps designed to hold a TV remote and an Xbox Wireless Controller. It's also got a creepy face that only a nightmare could love. And while these Couch-Panions aren't going to heading to stores, fans will get their chance to win one.</p><p>Starting today and going through November 16, Microsoft is running a contest that will let ten fans receive a Moon Man Couch-Panion of their own. To enter on X, players need to follow <a href="https://x.com/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on the platform</a> and repost <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1978445838452986255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the original Moon Man Couch-Panion contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag. Instagram users can also join in by following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on Instagram</a> and by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/p/DP1LAntkeVg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">commenting on the official contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag before the end of the contest period.</p><p>Microsoft recently unveiled a pair of limited-edition <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-getting-some-pricy-customizable-xbox-controllers/1100-6535316/" data-ref-id="1100-6535316">Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers</a>, which are customizable and more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">shared the launch times</a> earlier this week, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.</p>
