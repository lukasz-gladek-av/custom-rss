                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> won't be leaving early access and launching in full this year, according to game director Jonathan Rogers.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with GameSpot ahead of the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2s-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">Path of Exile 2's huge The Third Edict update</a>, which adds the ARPG's fourth campaign act, new temporary interlude acts, its first seasonal league, and more, Rogers said that despite his hopes earlier in the year, Path of Exile 2 won't fully release in 2025. That also means the game won't be going free-to-play anytime soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiA_IFmidOQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KiA_IFmidOQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I definitely don't believe that's possible anymore," Rogers said. "Things have taken a bit longer than we'd hoped. Ultimately, there's two things that need to happen before we can leave early access. One of them is that we obviously need to finish the campaign. I don't think that will take too much longer. But the other one is we have to get to the point of balance where everyone is actually happy with how things are. The general opinion needs to be that we've actually got it locked in. Obviously we can't go into full release until we've sorted that out. Once those two things are true, then we'll release."</p><p dir="ltr">While The Third Edict update adds Act IV of Path of Exile 2's campaign, developer Grinding Gear Games still needs to release Acts V and VI. Rogers said that while Act V will definitely come as part of early access, it's possible Act VI's arrival would coincide with the game's full launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There are still five classes yet to be added to Path of Exile 2 as well--the Templar, Druid, Shadow, Marauder, and Duelist. One nearly made it into The Third Edict, Rogers said, but ultimately didn't make the cut.</p><p dir="ltr">"We still intended to get a class out for this one, we just didn't quite finish it in time," Rogers said. "There will definitely be a class in the next update, I'd say. I say definitely even though I probably shouldn't, but the classes unfortunately have a bit of unbounded amount of time. You can go into them thinking you know what they are and then by the time you're actually done, you've refactored a bunch of things a bunch of times and it's way harder than you expect. We had a class in mind, we did a lot of work on it. We realized, 'You know what, if we're going to finish off all these bosses and things, we can't quite finish the class,' so it ended up not happening, but we'll get there."</p><p dir="ltr">GGG has previously said it expected Path of Exile 2 to be in early access for "at least" six months. Towards the beginning of this year, GGG announced it was putting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-is-throwing-a-wrench-into-updates-for-poe-1-we-were-fooling-ourselves/1100-6529154/" data-ref-id="1100-6529154">major update on hold for the original Path of Exile</a> in order to work on updates for Path of Exile 2. At the time, Rogers said the studio "still had a lot to learn about how to run two games simultaneously."</p><p dir="ltr">For those who want to dive into Path of Exile 2 but don't want to pay for early access, the game will be holding a free weekend August 29-September 1 to coincide with the launch of The Third Edict update.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In Halloween: The Game, players will take on the roles of either residents of Haddonfield, Illinois or The Shape himself, Michael Myers. As residents, players will need to survive, stick to the shadows, warn other residents, and hopefully reach the authorities before Michael gashes them up.</p><p>The game will offer a single-player story mode, offline bots mode, and online asymmetrical PvP. It will also include multiple maps and "authentic locations" pulled from the classic film. Last October, GameSpot spoke to several creators working in the space of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-hollywoods-iconic-monsters-kicked-off-a-horror-game-revolution/1100-6527506/" data-ref-id="1100-6527506">adapting horror movies into games</a>. Gun Media CEO, Wes Keltner, told me at that time that he wanted "to work with [Illfonic] again, 100%. So I'm hoping that we can find something that is a good fit for both our teams at the right time."</p><p>At that time, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-halloween-game-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-is-in-development-gamer-john-carpenter-is-involved/1100-6525712/" data-ref-id="1100-6525712">Halloween project built in Unreal Engine 5 had already been teased by Boss Team Games</a>, a publisher that also operates in the horror movie-to-game pipeline, having previously worked on things like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/evil-dead-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-523752">Evil Dead</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halloween-ash-vs-evil-dead-retrorealms-double/" data-ref-id="5000-639530">RetroRealms</a>. It's unclear at this time whether this is that same Halloween game. It seems to be, in which case it would seem Boss Team is no longer involved, and instead, the Friday The 13th duo has achieved their reunion.</p><p>In the time since Friday The 13th, Illfonic has gone on to make other licensed multiplayer games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" data-ref-id="5000-570897">Killer Klowns from Outer Space</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds/" data-ref-id="5000-496361">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghostbusters-spirits-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-561168">Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed</a>. Meanwhile, Gun put out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-texas-chain-saw-massacre/" data-ref-id="5000-547380">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>.</p><p>Stay tuned to GameSpot for much more on this upcoming horror project. </p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I don't know that we've ever seen a year quite like this one when it comes to new co-op experiences. From major-publisher-backed hits like Split Fiction and Grounded 2, to indie darlings like REPO and Peak, there hasn't just been a significant quantity of games meant for co-op play, but they've gone in so many different, yet similarly exciting, directions.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, I've been left wanting for one specific reason, and I imagine other parents can relate: It's hard to find games to play with my kids, so I'm glad <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-voyagers/" data-ref-id="5000-681511">Lego Voyagers</a> is just around the corner.</p><p dir="ltr">Split Fiction, for example, may be regarded as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/">best co-op game</a> of the year and, more broadly speaking, a possible Game of the Year contender, much like It Takes Two before it. But Hazelight's co-op games aren't meant for smaller, less-experienced hands. Their puzzles and action sequences demand a lot from players, to the extent that I can't play it with my six-year-old, who is a lifelong gamer, but still finds such games a bit too chaotic to handle. And then there are games like REPO, a game about repossessing valuables from locales stalked by monsters, and Peak, where Boy Scouts scale mountains to reach help after a plane crash, but often plummet to their cartoonish deaths. While I'm personally okay with some of the more mature visuals and themes in these games and play them with my older child often, they can still ask too much of my youngest on the controller, and that's if their anxiety-inducing gameplay doesn't undo her.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Voyagers thankfully avoids leaving me with these hang-ups as a gaming parent looking for the next great bonding experience. Instead, what I saw in a recent hands-on demo is a laid-back, creative play space full of platforming puzzles that felt welcoming to virtually anyone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J4Zq-A6FAw" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1J4Zq-A6FAw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Filling in for my kids in my scheduled demo was my colleague, Jason Fanelli, who did a great job as my proxy child. In Lego Voyagers, we each took on the role of a small Lego brick featuring a single eye sticker. His red fella and my blue dude rolled around a world that looks very much like Light Brick Studio's earlier award-winning game, Lego Builder's Journey. Our path was paved with bricks constructed and colored to look like the sights you'd see on a nature walk. Quickly, we came upon a Lego playground, with various contraptions familiarizing us with the world's physics-based systems, before a rocket launch in the distance had us on our way to explore some more.</p><p dir="ltr">With the world consisting of what you could call a series of interconnected micro-sets, it was up to us to complete these dioramas with our ingenuity. In each section, Lego bricks of different shapes, sizes, and colors would be freely available for us to build a solution to a problem posed by the location. One of the earliest sections tasked us with traversing a gap over water. Naturally, a bridge was in order, so Jason and I worked together to build one. There was no timer, no enemy presence. It was just us, some loose bricks, and the problem in front of us. It gave me the distinct, familiar feeling of spilling out a bunch of Lego bricks onto a table and seeing what my kids and I come up with, free of any instruction booklet.</p><p dir="ltr">A bridge is simple enough--though I won't hide the fact that it took us a few minutes to master the building controls--but later sections demanded a bit more thought. Still, the level of strategy and controller inputs needed to succeed never got to the extent that I felt like any would-be players would be left behind due to a skill gap, at least not from what I've played so far. I got the sense this was an intentional choice, which we'll hopefully see throughout the entire game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553481"></a><figcaption>You'll build bridges, both literal and figurative, in Lego Voyagers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553481-legovoyagers_screenshot_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As an example of the types of puzzles you'll face, one memorable moment saw us needing to throw together a bunch of loose cylindrical pieces, creating a tall pole-like object. With each of us at an end of this pole, we could climb the terrain, wobbling up and over each natural step, moving end over end like a stiff Slinky. It was very satisfying, and though I'm sure this was the intended solution, the game's physics meant the answer still felt imprecise and experimental in a manner that ties nicely with Lego.</p><p dir="ltr">Like those aforementioned Hazelight games, Lego Voyagers must be played in co-op. There's no solo mode, and that's for good reason. The entire game's aesthetic creates the sense of a cozy bonding experience built specifically for two people to collaborate and enjoy each other's company. It's made complete with a soft soundtrack of chill, lo-fi music that I instantly adored.</p><p dir="ltr">As a whole, the game reminded me of the difference between a Studio Ghibli movie made for kids and something like The Minions Movie. The former balances adolescent whimsy with its mature writing so well, trusting its younger audience to get on its level, and leaving space for its world to breathe. The latter feels like a loud ad for a sugary cereal that no "balanced breakfast" actually requires. Surely there can be times for each type of experience, but I really appreciated how Light Brick Studio sought to provide an environment more conducive to restful, creative play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553483"></a><figcaption>Waterfront property is a bit more affordable in Lego form.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4553483-legovoyagers_screenshot_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Growing up with Lego, I've always found something so meditative about its building process; working through its numbered instructions can put a person in something like a flow state as they thoughtfully place each brick where it belongs. Playing Lego Voyagers gave me a strong sense of that familiar feeling I never outgrew, and I'm excited my kids will be able to enjoy it with me, just like when we decorate the dining room table with hundreds of colorful toy bricks.</p><p dir="ltr">LEGO Voyagers launches on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on September 15.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a> is a free-to-play tactical FPS that offers explosive 32v32 battles across three unique modes. With so many players in each match, it's perfectly reasonable to expect cross-play support to ensure that you're always able to find enough players to fill out each team. Plus, if you're trying to play with your friends, you'll want to be sure you can all group up together regardless of your platform preferences. So, let's take a look at Delta Force's cross-play situation, as well as break down its cross-progression situation.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-play?</h2><p><strong>Yes, Delta Force does have cross-play between PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC players</strong>. But players on those platforms can not play with anyone on iOS or Android, as the mobile versions are only cross-play with one another.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgXRDS1_GEs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QgXRDS1_GEs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you're on console, you can check in <strong>Settings &gt; Game</strong> to ensure you have cross-play toggled on. If you'd prefer to only play with folks on consoles, you'll want to keep this toggled off. However, if your friends are on PC, this has to be toggled on for you to play with them. The game does not have a cross-play toggle on PC, meaning PC players will always be placed in potentially mixed lobbies.</p><h2>Does Delta Force have cross-progression?</h2><p>Cross-progression in Delta Force is a bit complicated. Everything revolves around a <a href="https://pass.levelinfinite.com/?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Level Infinite Pass</a> (rather humorously abbreviated to LIPASS), and if you're not careful, you may encounter limitations that can stop you from being able to use cross-progression altogether.</p><p>If you've already played Delta Force on PC or mobile, you'll have already been forced to sign up for a LIPASS, as it's required on those platforms. As such, <strong>make sure you immediately sign in to your LIPASS account when you first start the game on console</strong>. If you play the game without linking to your LIPASS account, you'll be blocked from using cross-progression.</p><p>If you're just starting Delta Force on console and have never played it elsewhere, you'll still want to make sure you <strong>create a LIPASS account when prompted on your first bootup</strong>. If you fail to do so, your account will be stuck on the console you're on, meaning you can never carry your progress to any other platform in the future.</p><p>If you're a console player and know beyond a shadow of a doubt you'll never play Delta Force on any other platform, you can skip creating a LIPASS account. Again, however, just be aware that you'll never be able to move that progress over if you change your mind, so give it some careful consideration before making that decision.</p>
