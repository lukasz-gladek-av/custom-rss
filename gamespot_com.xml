                <p>Microsoft has lost this console generation to Sony when it comes to pure sales, but according to one analyst, the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> could be a "last hurrah" for the Xbox Series X and S consoles. <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of MIDiA Research</a> said in an interview that, although Sony will emerge as this console generation's victor, Microsoft could benefit substantially from GTA 6's launch in terms of hardware sales, especially of the less expensive Series S console.</p><p>"Like Rockstar's other flagship titles, GTA 6 will hit PlayStation and Xbox before it hits PC. Therefore, it could pay off for Xbox to have a significant Series S push and fire sale to tie in with GTA 6--as one last hurrah for this generation," Elliott told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/analyst-xbox-series-x-s-could-have-a-last-hurrah-with-grand-theft-auto-6-were-it-not-for-a-certain-blue-elephant-in-the-room" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. "The marketing team should be banging the drum, highlighting that 'The Series S is the most accessible way to play GTA 6.' A sub-$200 Series S could be an enticing entry point to GTA for cash-strapped consumers, of which there are many, thanks to today's tumultuous economy and cost-of-living crisis."</p><p>Currently, the 512 GB Xbox Series S is priced at $300, with the 1 TB version going for $350--it's not uncommon to see lower prices, though. Even if those prices hold until GTA 6 launches this year, the Series S would remain the least-expensive console someone could buy to play GTA 6, as the Series X and PS5 are more expensive.</p><p>The Series S is underpowered compared to the Series X and the PS5, of course, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">isn't worried about that</a>. "Look, we support the platforms where the consumers are for as long as they're there, and we find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech. Our labels are really good at that. I'm not really worried," Zelnick said.</p><p>However, Elliott also mentioned how the "sad-dad blue elephant in the room" is the possibility that Sony, not Microsoft, secures marketing rights to GTA 6. If this happens, it could give Sony a bigger edge, as trailers and other marketing materials would focus on PlayStation, not Xbox. Elliott pointed out how Sony paid Warner Bros. for the marketing rights to Hogwarts Legacy, which he said led to non-console owners buying a PlayStation console, not Xbox, to play the game.</p><p>"It is worth noting that PlayStation would very much want the same thing to happen with GTA 6. Take-Two also of course wants to sell the most copies it can and would do so via PS5's higher installed base. That's why I reckon PlayStation will get the rights," Elliott said.</p><p>Console sales in the US are slumping, and other experts have predicted that GTA 6's launch--combined with the debut of the Switch 2--could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">lift the overall gaming market in 2025</a>.</p><p>GTA 6 launches this fall for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">though it could be delayed</a>. Rockstar Games released the game's one and only trailer back in December 2023, and since then, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-gta-6s-second-trailer-just-broke-a-sad-record/1100-6528595/" data-ref-id="1100-6528595">has not said a single word about the game</a>.</p>

                <p>The Ice King's deception in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a> starts early on, as Mio and Zoe will need to work together to solve several puzzles before they can meet him. The first of these is the door puzzle, which throws players off by providing almost useless symbols into the mix.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455112"></a><figcaption>Ice King Palace door puzzle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455112-splitfiction_howtounlocktheiceking%27scastle0-3screenshot.png"></figure><h2>Ice King Palace door puzzle solution</h2><p>The instinct is to look at the symbols and match them with the icons on the door, but this isn't quite the way to solve this puzzle. When you get to the large door with the symbols on, turn Zoe into her fairy form and use the nearby flower trail to gain access through the door via the lock. Meanwhile, Mio should wait outside in her monkey form.</p><p>When she gets inside, Zoe will spot a lever and four buttons that control the outside buttons. Instead of matching the symbols, you want to get the notches around the outside of the buttons to line up with the flowing vines until they light up.</p><p>When all four of the buttons line up outside, and the vines are lit up, Mio should punch the buttons to lock them in. Then, the door will open, and you can proceed through the level.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4455111"></a><figcaption>Ice King Palace block puzzle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4455111-splitfiction_solvingtheiceblockpuzzleinhopesofspring0-20screenshot%281%29.png"></figure><h2>Ice King Palace ice block puzzle solution</h2><p>The next puzzle blocking your way to the Ice King is the block puzzle. Here, Mio can use her monkey form to punch the ice block across the ice in certain directions, while Zoe can use her tree form to raise large stones to block it in its path. If the stones aren't raised due to the slippery surface, the block will just keep sliding until it reaches an edge.</p><p>The goal is to get the ice block in the center of the area so that Mio can punch it through the green gateway and free up some space for them to move forward. This isn't as straightforward as it seems, as there are multiple options and pathways to take. If we take the block's starting position and say that the green gateway is south, the most effective solution is:</p><ul><li>Push the block south</li><li>Raise the stone to the east and push the block east</li><li>Raise the stone to the north and push the block north</li><li>Push the block east</li><li>Raise the stone to the north and push the block north</li><li>Raise the stone to the west and push the block west</li><li>Raise the stone to the south and push the block south</li><li>Raise the stone to the west and push the block west</li><li>Push the block south</li></ul><p>This will smash the gateway and free up Zoe and Mio's path forward.

<section><p>More than just Fallout in England</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Atomfall is a detective game. Yes, the post-apolyctic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest. From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together.</p><p dir="ltr">Atomfall's world might look derivative given how prevalent the post-apocalyptic genre is, but its setting and tone do a lot to differentiate it from its peers. The game takes place five years after the Windscale fire of 1957, a real-world event that happened in the UK and is considered one of the worst nuclear accidents in history. However, Atomfall envisions a world that never properly recovered from that disastrous event. Violent factions have popped up all over England, irradiated monsters roam the wilds, and--of course--there might be a few government conspiracies at play.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455028" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455028"></a><figcaption>Swinging the axe in Atomfall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455028-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_17_24_12.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While this may sound like Fallout England, Atomfall's tone is quite different. The dark, sarcastic humor of the wasteland is <em>mostly</em> replaced with a more grounded take on the genre. Creative Director Ben Fisher really wanted to capture the look and feel of British speculative fiction and science-fiction from the 1950s and 1960s, like Doctor Who and John Wyndham novels. The result feels like a uniquely British take on the post-apocalyptic setting.</p><p dir="ltr">This grounded tone makes a lot of sense when paired with its gameplay. Unlike Fallout, Atomfall is not an RPG. You are as frail as most of your enemies, and if a particular encounter is giving you grief, you can't level up your character and come back later. Different weapons and gear could give you an edge in a firefight, but almost every shootout feels deadly. Fisher mentioned Stalker and Metro as inspirations for Atomfall, and while it isn't as dense or complicated as GSC Game World's first-person shooter, the similarities are easy to spot. Ammunition is hard to come by, items like bandages and health packs are invaluable, and it doesn't take much to put you in the ground.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike Stalker, though, Atomfall has a bigger emphasis on melee combat. Given how scarce bullets are, most encounters can be settled with an axe, knife, bat, or one of the game's many close-quarters weapons. The melee combat isn't as robust as something like Avowed or Dying Light, but there is a bit of heft to the weapons, giving the melee combat a tactile feel. Plunging an axe into an enemy feels deadly and is accompanied by some crunchy sound effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Sniper Elite might seem like the polar opposite of Atomfall, it does retain Sniper Elite's open approach to exploration and combat. As Fisher puts it, "[In the Sniper Elite games] you've got a clear objective, and then you uncover ways to achieve that objective over time, and then you've got a sense of freedom in that space." For Atomfall, the team wanted to "take that template and make the entire game structure one giant Sniper Elite mission."</p><p dir="ltr">While it's hard to say if Atomfall will live up to this lofty ambition, the narrative structure could support something like this. It does have an overall objective, but how you achieve that goal seems relatively open-ended. The game will loosely guide you around one of its handful of semi-open-world maps, but it's up to you to put the mysteries of its world together, and it seems like there are multiple ways to uncover those mysteries, whether it's befriending a hostile faction or turning over every stone in an important dungeon. Unfortunately, I only got to see the first area in my play session, so I can't say how far-reaching or involved these narrative threads are, but if Rebellion pulls it off, it could make for an interesting approach to storytelling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455029"></a><figcaption>Sneaking around with a bow in Atomfall</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4455029-02_atomfall_preview_gp.mp4.00_10_28_12.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also hard to say if the combat will feel as open-ended as the Sniper Elite games. While you are given some agency when it comes to the weapons you use and approach you take for any given encounter, it doesn't quite have that sandbox feel that the Sniper Elite games are known for. This could change as you unlock more skills and find new weapons, but the more grounded approach to combat and the lack of climbing mechanics feels at odds with Sniper Elite's open approach to combat. This isn't necessarily a bad thing given Atomfall's tone and genre, but fans of Rebellion's recent games might not find as many toys in Atomfall's sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">My biggest criticism I can level at Atomfall--at least based on the 90 minutes I played--is that the enemy AI is fairly easy to exploit. Quite early on I figured out that if I kicked a human enemy and then used a heavy attack with my trusty axe, it was an instant kill. Since most enemies just rush you down, I would wait at the end of a hallway and let them come to me. It gets a little more complicated when there are ranged combatants, but as long as I broke their line of sight, they couldn't do much. Part of what makes survival games so compelling are their cunning use of NPC AI, and based on what I played, Atomfall doesn't quite hit the watermark set by games like Stalker and The Last of Us. It's possible that tweaking the difficulty and playstyle settings could alleviate this issue, but I didn't have time to dig into those options during my limited playtime.</p><p dir="ltr">Atomfall seems like a big swing for Rebellion. While it borrows bits and pieces from its previous games, it feels like a genuine attempt for the team to step outside of its comfort zone and deliver something different. The narrative structure in particular has me eager to explore that world and piece together its narrative. I'm very curious to see how the narrative holds up as the scope of the world expands and more threads are introduced, but if done well, it could make for a memorable story.</p>

                <p>Since 2020, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> has pit the three Guardian classes against each other in the Guardian Games to determine whether the Titans, the Warlocks, or the Hunters will reign supreme for a year. On March 11, the 2025 Guardian Games will begin with a few changes. Guardian Games Nightfalls and Focused Activities have been dropped from this year's event. In their place is a new boss rush mode called Rushdown, which looks like it will test even the most seasoned Destiny 2 players.</p><p>Bungie has shared <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/twid_03_06_2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the details for this year's Guardian Games</a>, including the way that Rushdown will work. Rushdown will assemble bosses from the campaigns, the seasonal story missions, and the exotic missions in battles that will get exponentially more difficult for players. Each run through Rushdown will feature five boss encounters, all of which must be completed before time expires. Time gets added to the clock with each boss that goes down, and teams that finish more quickly have a better chance of earning higher quality rewards.</p><p>Rushdown includes warm-up, standard, and expert modes, but only the last two will include combatants with modifiers while also letting players receive revive tokens. However, players will get a higher score if they use fewer revive tokens. All three modes will be open for standard matchmaking, class-based matchmaking, and private fireteam matches. Players will be judged by how many bosses they defeated and by their overall score.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455148" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455148"></a><figcaption>The new Arc Trace rifle from this year's Guardian Games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4455148-destiny2guardiangamestraceriffle.jpg"></figure><p>It just wouldn't be a Guardian Games without a new weapon. This year's addition to the armory is called Keraunios. It's a powerful new Arc trace rifle that features jolting impact, recycled energy, and rolling storm. Last year's addition, the Allstar Vector Skimmer, will be available again during this year's Guardian Games. Players will receive a temporary version of the weapon for the duration of the event. But if players want to permanently add it to their collection, they will need to complete a quest called Drop In.</p><p>Players who finish three encounters in any of the Rushdown modes will be guaranteed to receive a Guardians Games weapon during that run. The five scoring thresholds are bronze, silver, gold, platinum, and diamond. Naturally, players who reach the higher tiers in standard or expert will get better rewards. And players who achieve high scores in expert mode will also get the chance to pick up fully Masterworked Guardian Games weapons.</p><p>In order for players to help their preferred faction to win the overall Guardian Games, they have to team up with members of the same class and fight in PvP and other activities to earn medallions. Once the medallions are in hand, players need to bring them to the podium to count them among the total points for their class. There will be winning classes on every day of the event, but only one faction will be named the victor when the Guardian Games close after three weeks of competition. As usual this will be accompanied by an event card (including an Exotic emote and sparrow) and the ability to unlock The Champ as an in-game title.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455168" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455168"></a><figcaption>Guardian Games 2025 armor ornaments</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4455168-d2armor.jpg"></figure><p><span>A new set of armor ornaments will also be available and can be seen above. These will be available through Eververse in exchange for Silver or Bright Dust (meaning you can earn them without paying real money).</span></p><p>Outside of this event, Bungie recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-pvp-mode-heavy-metal-lets-you-finally-pilot-a-brig/1100-6529865/" data-ref-id="1100-6529865">a brand-new, limited-time PvP mode</a> called Heavy Metal that will arrive during Heresy Act 3.
