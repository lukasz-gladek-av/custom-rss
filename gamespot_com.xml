<section><p>I'm enjoying Death Stranding 2 so much more since I started skipping the plot.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>I tried to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2</a> the "right" way. For 12 hours, I had Sam hike all over Mexico and Australia delivering packages and battling brigands, and I watched every cutscene as I went. And despite being once again enamored with the moment-to-moment experience of being a porter in Death Stranding--it genuinely may be my favorite gameplay loop ever--I was having a bad time because I couldn't find any rhythm to the experience. The problem, as it was with the first game, is that Death Stranding 2 is full of cutscenes that are unnecessarily long, very poorly written, and don't fit together into any legitimate greater context.</p><p dir="ltr">And there are a lot of them. So many that I wasn't able to get into the flow of the gameplay experience. I'd have a great time walking around delivering stuff for an hour, then watch a 15-minute cutscene that sucked out all my energy, and then turn the game off because I needed a nap. Since I'd <em>really</em> been looking forward to playing Death Stranding 2, I was starting to find it disappointing, even though I was actually massively enjoying the "play" side of it.</p><p dir="ltr">My last straw was the introduction of the character called Rainy. Her first scene is a lengthy dance number in the rain that Sam watches. Her second scene is a tearful reunion with Sam's friends, who all apparently know Rainy very well even though none of them had ever mentioned her before. It isn't until her third scene that anyone tells Sam who Rainy is. But even then, her introduction doesn't matter--nothing about the gameplay experience changes at all as a result of meeting her, even though she's another magic person. These scenes look nice--very "cinematic," as it were--but they're completely devoid of substance or content. I was being forced to take breaks from the parts of the game I actually enjoyed so that I could watch some self-indulgent nonsense that I found incredibly grating.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524513" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524513"></a><figcaption>Our first look at Rainy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4524513-deathstranding2_onthebeach-finaltrailer_ps5games4-10screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So I tried something radical, something I have never done on my first playthroughs of any of the previous games designed by Hideo Kojima: I started skipping the cutscenes. I did it hesitantly at first, concerned that I might miss out on some important piece of lore or plot. I figured I'd use this power sparingly, only when a scene was overly long and not apparently going anywhere. But that cautious approach didn't last long. Within an hour of making that decision, I was skipping every cutscene as soon as it started.</p><p dir="ltr">Something funny happened after that: I played Death Stranding 2 for six straight hours. I was suddenly free to enjoy the parts I like without having to sit through the noise of the story. I no longer had to devote any brainpower toward trying to figure out how the latest nonsensical plot point makes sense next to the previous one. I could get back to the simple pleasures of walking around delivering packages and building infrastructure.</p><p dir="ltr">The goofy thing is that I knew it would go this way. I won't pretend that I expected Death Stranding 2's storytelling to be anything better than abysmal, but when I first booted it up, I did plan to watch all the cutscenes anyway. It was more for the sake of fairness than anything else--maybe this would be the one where Kojima's writing finally clicked for me. I had to give it a fair shot.</p><p dir="ltr">Up to now, I'd always been able to power through his games. I sat through every post-credits scene in MGS4, trudged all the way to the "we ran out of money" twist ending of MGSV, and I made it through the movie-length final cutscenes of the first Death Stranding in one sitting. I hated every second of it, but I did my due diligence. But I'm 38 years old now, and I no longer have the patience for all that.</p><p dir="ltr">And, to be completely honest, this is a lesson I should have already learned from the first Death Stranding. While I did watch all the cutscenes in the first game when I ran through it the first time, I later came back and played it through twice while skipping them all, saving <a href="https://youtu.be/HfrCcKDzOow?si=m0rXyVRkNhDmRydV" rel="nofollow ">11 hours</a> of my time in the process. I already had the blueprint to happiness, but I didn't want to take for granted that Death Stranding 2's story would be just as irritating and nonsensical as its predecessor's. I wanted to believe in Kojima the writer as much as I believe in Kojima the designer.</p><p dir="ltr">That hope is completely gone now, though, and that honestly makes me glad. Now that I'm free from any obligation to care about the cutscenes, I'm going to have the best possible time with the rest of Death Stranding 2.</p>

                <p>Steam Deck, Windows handheld, and Nintendo Switch users have no shortage of USB-C docks to choose from, but one of the coolest options we've seen is currently <strong>on sale for only $25 (was $50)</strong> at Amazon. If you love retro Nintendo games, check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GuliKit-Docking-Station-Switch-Charging/dp/B0D12N6PGK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GuliKit's 7-in-1 Docking Station</a> that pays homage to the Super Nintendo. Unsurprisingly, this SNES-inspired USB-C dock isn't officially licensed by Nintendo, but it captures the style and color scheme of the legendary 16-bit console rather well.</p><p>To get this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">early Prime Day deal</a>, you need to <strong>check the 50% off coupon box below the price</strong> on the store page or click "clip coupon" after adding it to your cart.

Along with the USB-C port for power delivery, you'll find three USB 3.0 ports on the back. The included USB-C adapter can deliver up to 100 watts of power to your handheld and tablet devices.</p><p>Naturally, the dock is smaller than an actual SNES console. At 6.4 x 5.1 x 2 inches, GuliKit's docking station is slightly larger than the SNES Mini.</p><p>As shown in the image above, the dock has a removable cover designed to resemble the Super Nintendo's cartridge deck. You can slide the cover to adjust the dock's angle and the width of the stand. GuliKit says the stand is thick enough for most grip cases. If you remove the cover and flip it over, you'll find four microSD storage slots.</p><p>This is a versatile, multiplatform dock with support for Steam Deck OLED and LCD models, Nintendo Switch consoles, and Windows handheld PCs like the Asus ROG Ally and Ayaneo devices. It's not compatible with Switch 2, but it's worth noting that virtually every notable docking station for handheld gaming is incompatible with Switch 2. This is because the console needs to draw 20 volts of power to switch to TV mode, and 15 volts has been the standard.</p><p>It's also worth noting that like many docks, this one is designed to connect to a USB-C port on the top of the handheld. The original Switch and Switch OLED only have a single USB-C port on the bottom. This means you'll need to flip the console upside down to dock it, if you choose to use it as a Switch dock.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524477" data-ratio="0.62098138747885" data-width="1182" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png" data-ref-id="1300-4524477"></a><figcaption>GuliKit's USB-C dock has three USB ports on the back for peripherals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4524477-gulikitsnes.png"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-criterion-collection-best-movie-deals-amazon-blu-ray-sale/1100-6532794/">The Criterion Collection 50% Off Movie Sale - Here Are The Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-preorder-guide-amazon-exclusive-edition-bonuses-release-date/1100-6532712/">Little Nightmares 3 Amazon-Exclusive Mirror Edition Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legos-first-visual-history-for-adults-is-60-off-in-early-prime-day-deal/1100-6532717/">Lego's First Visual History For Adults Is 60% Off In Early Prime Day Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-earth-dancer-limited-edition-nintendo-switch-2-restock/1100-6526172/">Amazon Restocks Rune Factory: Guardians Of Azuma Earth Dancer Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-four-discontinued-donkey-kong-lego-sets-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6532560/">All Four Discontinued Donkey Kong Lego Sets Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-collector-edition-launch-buying-guide/1100-6530003/">Death Stranding 2 Collector's Edition Is In Stock Ahead Of Tomorrow's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-preorder-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530595/">Donkey Kong Bananza Game &amp; Amiibo Bundle Available At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Jean Grey aka Phoenix has been rumored to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a> bound for a while, and now it's official. NetEase has confirmed that Phoenix will arrive in Marvel Rivals Season 3 alongside Blade, the popular vampire hunter. But their mutual enemy won't be Dracula or any of the undead. Instead, the heroes of Marvel Rivals will be going up against one of Venom's deadliest foes: Knull, the King in Black and the God of Symbiotes.</p><p>Season 3 is subtitled "The Abyss Awakens," and it's going to launch on July 11. Phoenix will be joining the roster right away, and she will be classified as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelist</a>. Even without the Phoenix Force, Jean is an immensely powerful telepath and telekinetic mutant. With the Phoenix at her command, Jean is fire and life incarnate, and imbued with the power of creation itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Season 3: The Abyss Awakens Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Marvel Rivals' new map, Klyntar: Celestial Husk, as a link to the Guardians of the Galaxy's favorite hangout, Knowhere. The entirety of Knowhere was constructed inside the severed head of a dead Celestial. The Celestial Husk is the rest of that Celestial's body.</p><p>In the Marvel Universe, Klyntar was believed to be the homeworld of the Symbiotes. Instead, it turned out to be the place where they imprisoned Knull eons ago. Once Knull is free, he can reclaim control of the Symbiotes and unleash mayhem in the universe.</p><p>Blade is being held back for the second half of Season 3 alongside a new competitive mode, but in the meantime there will be new features, a battle pass, system updates, and four new Team-ups. NetEase is overhauling Marvel Rivals' mission system and adding a new layer of customization to the accessories system.</p><p>NetEase is also offering verified university students free access to costume trials that will rotate each season. For now, this offer is limited to the US, the UK, and a few other places, but more regions will be added later. And going forward, Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p><p>Fans heading to San Diego Comic-Con later this month will be able to visit the Marvel Rivals experience at the Marriott Marquis from Thursday, July 24 to Sunday, July 27. On Friday, July 25, Comic-Con will host the Marvel Rivals: Hero Creation from Concept to Showcase panel, with guests, start time, and location to be announced.</p><p>This fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-deeper-look-marvel-rivals-visual-style-with-this-new-art-book/1100-6531342/" data-ref-id="1100-6531342">The Art of Marvel Rivals</a> will give fans a behind-the-scenes peak at the creation of the game's character designs and locations. One of the most recent additions to the game's lineup, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adds-ultron-to-the-lineup-in-season-2-5/1100-6531758/" data-ref-id="1100-6531758">Ultron</a>, wasn't announced when Season 2 began. It stands to reason there may be more surprise characters in Season 3 as well.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate</a>, is bringing a whole lot of new gear and activities, along with quality-of-life improvements to how you'll actually play and earn all that stuff. One big change is coming to how you'll earn the new Exotic armors coming to the expansion, at least for a little while, thanks to a new destination activity coming with the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">During its Edge of Fate livestream on July 1, Destiny 2 assistant game director Robbie Stevens mentioned--in pretty vague terms--a new three-player, matchmade destination activity that'll be available in the game's new location, Kepler. Stevens didn't name the activity, instead saying Bungie had hoped its arrival would "surprise and delight" players, but did give a few details about what it'll be like and how it'll work. Most notably, the new activity will offer an opportunity to earn new versions of the new Exotic armor items you can get from completing the expansion's Legendary campaign.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That makes the Kepler activity a reliable way to get specific Exotics, something that has been rare in Destiny 2. Earning the Exotics from the destination activity will give you a chance to grab copies with different distributions of stats, which can be necessary for players looking to perfect their character loadouts. It sounds like you'll still need to complete the expansion's Legendary campaign to get the chance at these additional copies, however.</p><p dir="ltr">Stevens shared a few other details about the new activity as well. While he said it'll be a unique activity, he also likened it to multi-stage destination activities like Wellspring in Savathun's Throne World and Vex Incursion in Neomuna. Both those activities see players fighting hordes at different points around the destination map. According to Stevens, the Kepler activity is "horde mode-inspired," but it'll also have mechanical elements and boss encounters. The activity will also make use of Kepler's new destination abilities. Those include Matterspark, which lets you turn into a ball of Arc energy, Mattermorph, which allows you to use dark matter to move certain objects around, creating pathways and platforms, and Relocator, a big gun that lets you take over Fallen teleporters for your own ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Notably, the Kepler activity is also "technically time-limited," Stevens said. A node will appear on the Kepler destination map to inform players of when the activity will be available so they can farm it, which makes it sound like it'll potentially run for short periods of time before going away, and then coming back again. Stevens said the activity is connected to the story campaign that takes place on Kepler--specifically toward its end--which gives the impression that it won't be available until sometime after the launch of The Edge of Fate, so that players have time to work through the story before jumping into it.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out other details from the Edge of Fate livestream, including info about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">Destiny 2's next raid race</a> and a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">how Matterspark will let you sequence break puzzles</a>.</p>

                <p>The difference between real and generated frames is a hotly contested topic, especially when it comes to their prevalence in PC gaming. Nvidia and AMD have made big improvements to their own solutions for predicting and simulating frames that can be inserted in-between real ones spat out by your GPU, and now Steam is making it a little easier to determine the difference between the two.</p><p>In an update to its in-game performance tools, Valve has added the ability to differentiate between frames generated by your hardware, and ones generated by your pick for frame generation, whether it's Nvidia's DLSS suite or AMD's FSR toolset. A new frames-per-second counter can show you what frame rate you're currently seeing with frame generation on, and what is actually being rendered by the game, which can be useful to determine issues with the technology.</p>

<p>Usually, issues arise with frame generation when your base frame rate isn't high enough, creating a mismatch between the responsiveness of the game and the fluidity you see on-screen. Valve's approach lets you determine if your settings are still a bit too demanding for your hardware by letting you see the true frame rate at a glance, so that you can make adjustments to fine-tune this balance.</p><p>The update also adds more information to the overlay, including additional GPU and CPU utilization information, maximum and minimum frame rates, a frame rate graph, and more. You can choose between four display levels in the in-game overlay settings, as well as the color and opacity of the display to suit the game they're being layered onto.</p><p>Valve says this update is specifically for Windows users now, and for modern GPU hardware. Additional support will come at a later, undetermined date. You can find out more about how Valve calculates all of its performance metrics in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">detailed breakdown here</a>.</p>

                <p>During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> livestream for The Edge of Fate, which is set for release on July 15, Bungie developers explained how they expect players to sequence break the new planet of Kepler--and that's intentional.</p><p>The new destination of Kepler is described as being similar in depth to the Rise of Iron content from the original game in 2016. It was complex with many puzzles and mysteries to solve. The Edge of Fate's content has been designed so that the campaign missions "slowly" lead players into unlocking different abilities and the varying levels of them, as well as uncovering more of Kepler's explorable areas.</p><p>There are puzzles to figure out, secrets to unlock, and particular routes that will be inaccessible without using abilities, such as Matterspark, to shrink down and traverse through vents or hidden paths. During the stream, Bungie developers explained that this was done in order to teach players that it's necessary to look at and think about the world around them in a different way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After the main campaign story missions are complete, you can unlock abilities anywhere, but this means that you can sequence break puzzles and missions. Bungie says that this is "entirely intentional" and that it is looking forward to seeing what players can do beyond the limits of its own playtesting processes.</p><p>"We're not 100% sure where players might sequence break," said Destiny 2 assistant game director, Robbie Stevens, "but that's intentional."</p><p>With the news that players breaking Destiny 2 is finally intended by Bungie, it'll be interesting to watch the varied combinations and broken builds created by players in action.</p><p>Where Bungie draws a stricter line though is its raids, with many items and abilities being disabled for the Contest Mode versions of its raid races. During the stream, Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid race start date</a>, and detailed the new Epic raid system that will be available shortly after its release.</p>

                <p>In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>developer livestream, Bungie has detailed the start date for The Edge of Fate raid race, and it may signal some changes to the traditional raid race experience that players are used to.</p><p>For the past few expansions, Guardians have had 48 hours to complete the raid race on Contest Mode. Contest Mode is a time-limited version of the race that is available as soon as the raid is released. It has inflated difficulty in the form of reduced outgoing damage, higher combatant health, and a reliance on flawless team communication and strategy. These traditionally began on the Friday following the release of the expansion on Tuesday, but this time around that's changing.</p><p><strong>The Edge of Fate raid race will begin on Saturday, July 19</strong>.</p><p>We assume that it will still begin at the daily reset time, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, several weeks after the raid's initial release, a new version of the raid will become available. This is known as an Epic version of the raid and will expand the story, adding new content. Bungie emphasized that it is not holding anything back in the base version of the raid to enable the Epic version to exist, but rather that the Epic raid will "enhance" the raid experience.</p><p>For those wondering about how to prepare for the race in the four short days between the expansion's release and the launch of the raid, Bungie recommends completing the campaign's main story on Legendary difficulty to reach the recommended Power level.</p><p>Guardians can further enhance their preparation by grinding for more powerful gear, which can drop at higher tiers with more benefits when completing difficult activities. With the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">new Exotics</a>, armor, and modifiers, this raid race will be one to watch.</p>
