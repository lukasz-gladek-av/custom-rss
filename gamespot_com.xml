                <p>A streamer who found himself in the legal crosshairs of Nintendo has been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages to the company. Nintendo sued Jesse "EveryGameGuru" Keighin in 2024, accusing him of livestreaming pirated games before they were released and for sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators.</p><p>Keighin had gone on the offensive after he was accused, telling Nintendo that "you might run a corporation, but I run the streets," on his social media channels (via <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/" rel="nofollow ">TorrentFreak</a>). The lawsuit accused Keighin of streaming leaked Nintendo games since 2022, and Nintendo claimed that his actions had cost the company "millions of dollars" in lost video game sales. Keighin reportedly did not have a prepared defense for the case, leading to a default judgment against him.</p><p>Nintendo had also requested a broad permanent injunction against Keighin and any third parties working with him to prevent them from using emulators--as well as the destruction of "all infringing" hardware and software--but the Colorado court did not agree to this request, rejecting it as "unclear" and "unreasonable" demands.</p><p>Known for being notoriously litigious when it comes to protecting its IP, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo also sued James Williams</a> recently, who moderated a Reddit page that promoted Switch piracy. Nintendo is demanding $4.5 million from Williams, accusing him of running several Switch piracy sites and selling pirated Switch games. Last year, Nintendo was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/">successful in shutting down Switch and 3DS emulators</a>, and it is currently involved in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/">legal battle against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p>

                <p>Akira Yamaoka, best known for his decades-spanning contributions to the Silent Hill series, is bringing his talents to an upcoming horror game from the creators of Turbo Overkill. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/total-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-626760">Total Chaos</a> is scheduled to arrive later this year, and GameSpot can exclusively reveal both Yamaoka's involvement and his theme song for the game, "Catharsis." Listen to the song's world premiere below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guO_QkSFOTE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guO_QkSFOTE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Total Chaos was born as a mod for Doom 2, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos" rel="nofollow ">originally released</a> in 2018. The forthcoming adaptation from Trigger Happy Interactive and Apogee Entertainment is a complete reimagining of that source material on a new engine. Yamaoka is working with the mod's original composer, Jason Dagenet, to bring the game's music to life. As any Silent Hill fan would know, the debut track definitely carries the composer's signature sound.</p><p>In the first-person horror game, players can expect to find the touchstones of the survival-horror genre, such as resource management, crafting survival equipment, and a parade of monsters that bring their own behaviors and attacks to worry about.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's Steam page</a>, mysterious radio transmissions will guide the protagonist across the shifting locale of Fort Oasis, as the character sets out to confront his own "fractured past." It sounds like more than just the music will appeal to Silent Hill fans.</p><p>There's no announced release date for Total Chaos just yet, but players can expect to learn about that soon, as the game remains on track for a 2025 launch.</p>
