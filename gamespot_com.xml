                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 and Divinity developer Larian has confirmed that it uses generative AI in its development processes, but not necessarily in the way you might think.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Bloomberg</a>, Larian boss Swen Vincke said its developers use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations. Vincke said, "I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we're using it." That said, Bloomberg reported that there has been "some pushback at Larian."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Divinity Will Be Better Than Baldur’s Gate 3 “On All Fronts” Says Larian CEO</p>
      </div>
<p>He also confirmed that the new Divinity game will not have any AI-generated content in it. "Everything is human actors; we're writing everything ourselves," he said.</p><p>None of this is new or surprising, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">Vincke said many months ago that Larian was using machine learning systems for a variety of functions</a>, including "tasks that nobody wants to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"For an RPG developer, what you really want is something that helps with reactivity to agency," he said. "So, permutations that you did not foresee, reactions to things that the player has done, in the world, they will certainly augment the gameplay experience," Vincke said of using machine learning to help generate new gameplay elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke, like many in the industry before him, also said he is aware of "red flags" pertaining to the use of generative AI in game development.</p><p>Some people have legitimate fears of machine learning and AI systems stealing their work or taking their jobs. However, Vincke said Larian is hiring more people, not fewer, thanks to new technologies. This is what others,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969"> like EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick</a>, have predicted.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's always going to be the people that are going to make a difference," Vincke said. "And so for us, it's super clear that we're investing heavily into the team and the human touch that's being added to that."</p><p dir="ltr">With more automation, human workers are freed up to create more, which in turn leads to the possibility of making "more complex things," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">"When complexity goes up, things start getting really interesting. So it's fair to say that the games that are being made today are arguably more complex than they were in the past," he said. "The faster you can iterate, the faster you will get to a certain result. And then and the tightening of those pipelines should allow you, in theory, to make your games in a more efficient manner."</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke also said the general population might not be aware of how much time an animator may spend on "stuff they don't want to work on." As such, thanks to automation, "It adds a lot to the time that they have to work on the creative stuff," Vincke said.</p><p dir="ltr">Vincke said it's "the wrong attitude" to assume that automation will replace various people and departments. Because automation should, in theory, allow people to do "more of what really matters and less of the stuff that they don't want to do."</p><p dir="ltr">"That's not necessarily cost reduction," he added. "But it's going to be an increase of ability, which is a good thing."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Divinity game was announced at The Game Awards recently with a flashy--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-the-game-awards-trailers-got-really-gross-this-year/1100-6536908/" data-ref-id="1100-6536908">and super gross</a>--CGI trailer. The game has no release date as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, be sure to read GameSpot's own new interview with Vincke, in which he claims that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-larian-ceo-swen-vincke/1100-6536981/" data-ref-id="1100-6536981">the new Divinity game will be better than Baldur's Gate 3 "on all fronts."</a></p>

                <p>Infinity Ward, the developer of the popular Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series, has told fans, "Don't believe everything you read on the internet" amid a rumor about next year's game.</p><p>In a post on social media, the studio wished fans a happy holiday and teased that it's "looking forward to talking soon." In the meantime, the developer said fans should be wary of what they read on the internet. Although there was no further context provided, this may be a reference to a recent report that claimed Infinity Ward is making 2026's Call of Duty game, rumored to be Modern Warfare 4, and that its multiplayer would be a "complete copy" of Modern Warfare 2's.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Happy holidays everybody!</p><p>Wishing our community an awesome holiday season and looking forward to talking soon.</p><p>Don't believe everything you read on the Internet.

This has yet to be confirmed, but Infinity Ward's latest social media post ended with, "See you in 2026."</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is the newest entry in the series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/" data-ref-id="1100-6536893">reportedly sold worse than 2024's Black Ops 6</a>.

                <p>Ubisoft has acquired the game March of Giants from Amazon Games, and this also means that creative director Xavier Marquis has returned to Ubisoft.

The game combines elements of real-time strategy and lane-based combat. It's called March of Giants because players take on the role of a giant who is controlling troops on the battlefield.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zn2aJ3UmVnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marquis said in a news release that, "Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle."</p><p>"We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level," he said.</p><p>Parizeau, meanwhile, thanked Amazon for supporting March of Giants and said he's excited to re-join Ubisoft to "build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs."</p><p>March of Giants has held multiple playtests on Steam, but there is no word yet on a release date for the full game, nor do we know if it may come to consoles.</p><p>The sale of March of Giants to Ubisoft comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cuts-hit-video-game-division-reducing-work-on-mmos/1100-6535769/" data-ref-id="1100-6535769">Amazon confirmed mass layoffs across the company</a>, including at its gaming division.

                <p>Pedro "Flute Guy" Eustache has become one of The Game Awards most-beloved returning figures, known for playing his outlandish collection of flutes with incredible passion and panache. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-keeps-the-legend-of-flute-guy-strong/1100-6536923/" data-ref-id="1100-6536923">another stellar performance</a> at The Game Awards 2025, Eustache has taken to social media to show off all the different instruments he played in this year's show.</p><p>While Eustache's stage presence is the main element that has made him so popular with viewers of The Game Awards, his unusual collection of instruments has also tickled the internet's fancy over the years he's been a part of The Game Awards Orchestra. This year, he has named all the different instruments he played in the famous Game of the Year medley, which include a handful of curiously custom-made or customized instruments.</p><p>Showing them off in the order they were played during the medley, Eustache's first two instruments are western concert flutes with swapped-out headpieces--the first from a traditional Armenian shvi, and the second a 3D-printed head based on the Armenian blul. Eustache also demonstrates the strange flute he played during the Clair Obscur section of the medley, simply calling it a "PVC-based flute." <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999518701444337802" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Geoff Keighley revealed</a> after the show that Eustache built this instrument just for TGAs.</p><p>The next flute is another traditional folk instrument, this time a Chinese dizi. The medley is finished with two western flutes, the bass flute, and the huge contrabass flute--the former being the instrument Eustache first went viral with during his enthusiastic performance in the 2022 Game of the Year medley.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm elated that you were unto our GOTY TGA 2025 performance.<br>YES you got it: the Thumb-size-Ocarina wasn't on my last video!<br>Thanks to @geoffkighley &amp; @lornebafle &amp; to God, for His awesome grace!<br>Stay tuned: many more great projects coming up soon!<br>God bless you all! <a href="https://t.co/CfF87T9IRR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/CfF87T9IRR</a></p>  — Pedro Eustache (@EustachePedro) <a href="https://twitter.com/EustachePedro/status/2000797921735008329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a follow-up video, Eustache revealed that he had omitted one instrument that made an appearance at the 2025 awards ceremony--the thumb-sized ocarina played for Donkey Kong Bananza. He finishes by thanking "gamers of the world" for their support, promising he will indeed be back for The Game Awards 2026.</p><p>Outside of Flute Guy and the TGA orchestra's incredible performances, this year's awards show was dominated by Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which took home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-breaking 13 nominations and nine award wins</a>, including Game of the Year.
