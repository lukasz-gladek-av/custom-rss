                <p>The war-torn sandboxes of any Battlefield multiplayer mode are primed for absurd and physics-defying moments, but an exploit in the newly released Battlefield 6 that lets you bounce off of ladders is in the crosshairs of the game's developers.</p><p>Assault-class players can equip a ladder in one of their gadget slots, giving them and their squadmates easier ways to traverse vertically to higher ground. But the ladder has some quirks with its physics, and players have found themselves bouncing off this piece of equipment when trying to climb.</p><p>As with any bug, people began experimenting to find ways to exploit it, leading to many gameplay clips online showcasing players "ladder launching" themselves airborne. It doesn't appear to be a particularly useful strategy at the moment, and players hoping to hone this technique probably won't get to use it in the long term.</p><p>In response to an X post calling for the bug to be patched, Battlefield lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Sirland simply replied</a>: "We will."</p><p>Battlefield Studios has been quick to jump on player feedback, addressing issues like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-matches-are-speeding-up/1100-6535444/" data-ref-id="1100-6535444">pace of Conquest matches</a> and wonky hit detection. These fixes should put Battlefield 6 in a solid place before its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">first season launches on October 28</a>.</p><p>Less than a week after its release, Battlefield 6 already looks like a hit, much like that shot that didn't register, with one report claiming that the EA-published title has already produced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">Call of Duty-like sales numbers</a> of around 6.5 million copies of the game sold.</p>

                <p>The shoot-'em-up legends at Psikyo delivered some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-shooter-games/2900-6622/" data-ref-id="2900-6622">genre's best games</a> prior to shutting their doors more than 20 years ago. If you haven't played any Psikyo games yet and you're on PC, you'd be wise to purchase them soon, as they're being delisted from Steam at the end of October.</p><p>Due to a license expiring, following October 31, the following Psikyo games will no longer be available on Steam:</p><ul><li>Strikers 1945</li><li>Strikers 1945 II</li><li>Strikers 1945 III</li><li>Gunbird</li><li>Gunbird 2</li><li>Gunbarich</li><li>Samurai Aces</li><li>Samurai Aces Episode II: Tengai</li><li>Samurai Aces Episode III: Sengoku Cannon</li><li>Sol Divide</li><li>Dragon Blaze</li><li>Zero Gunner 2</li></ul><p>The delistings only apply to the Steam versions, so those looking to buy the games on other platforms, like <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/psikyo-shooting-stars-bravo-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOor1AZv8bT2C1YYW3KRBxJAD3JJpCbD2D_uHnK-feBRL3sjYmujV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch</a>, will still be able to do so, and you can continue playing them on Steam past October 31 if you've purchased them. There are multiple bundles available, should you be interested in a particular series, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/18805/PSIKYO_SHOOTER_Collectors_Bundle/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundle containing all of these games</a> is available for just over $100. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4585666-striker1-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585666" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4585666-striker1-2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585666"></a><figcaption>Strikers 1945</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4585666-striker1-2.png"></figure><p>Psikyo, which was founded by former Video System developers, quickly established itself as a premier shoot-'em-up developer. Alongside the Strikers trilogy (and a Neo Geo version with some gameplay differences) the Gunbird and Samurai Aces series are among the highlights, as is the fantasy-themed Dragon Blaze. They offer a number of difficulty settings and tremendously fast-paced and polished action. Prior to iiRcade's shutdown in 2023, the majority of Psikyo games were also available on its digital store, which players can still enjoy if their cabinet didn't break like mine did.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios continues to update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> based on feedback, with the newest change addressing ticket numbers for the Conquest maps.</p><p>In a statement, Battlefield Studios said it's reducing the starting ticket-counts to help matches "finish at a more natural pace." The developer said its data showed that "many rounds" were concluding by time limit as opposed to when one team ran out of tickets, which is why it's making these new changes. The developer also pledged to continue looking at feedback and data to sure match flow "feels right."</p><p>For anyone unaware, in Battlefield games, tickets are reduced by killing enemies or holding more capture points than the other team. Here is a breakdown of the changes:</p><ul><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p>Battlefield Studios also recently <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made a change to Battlefield 6 to address hit-registration</a> after some people said it wasn't working properly. Another recent change included <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increasing ticket-count for some maps for Rush mode, from 75 to 100</a>. There have been weapon-balance changes, too, including reduced muzzle velocity for the M2020 ESR and the PSR.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 </a>launches on October 28, which is also the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>Publisher Electronic Arts has not announced any sales numbers for Battlefield 6 yet, but one analyst estimated the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-call-of-duty-size-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-4-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 6.5 million copies out of the gate.</a></p>

                <p>Sega and Waze have partnered to bring Sonic the Hedgehog to the GPS app, and as part of it, Sonic's voice will give you driving directions to wherever you're headed.</p><p>Beginning today, October 15, Waze users can activate Sonic as a new voice navigation option, and they can choose from English and French. Users will hear Sonic tell you where to go "with his usual coolness and confidence to guide the way," Sega said in a news release. One thing he probably won't say is that you gotta go fast. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585657" data-ratio="0.55589586523737" data-width="653" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585657"></a><figcaption>Sonic comes to Waze.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4585657-screenshot2025-10-15at9.54.50%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Additionally, a variety of Sonic-themed icons are now available in the Waze app. One of them, "Speedster Lightning," shows your car as a vehicle from Sonic Racing: Crossworlds. Users can also choose the "Energetic" mood to transform the Waze app with "extra Sonic personality."</p><p>Sega said it's doing this partnership with Waze to celebrate the 35th anniversary of Sonic the Hedgehog.
