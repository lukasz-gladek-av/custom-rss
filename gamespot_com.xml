Here's what we know about the bug and how to avoid it.</p><p>The bug has been detailed under known issues in Helldivers 2's Discord, and concerns the ODST MA5C Assault Rifle. "When on the bridge, if all players equip this weapon from the armory and then the host leaves it will cause your game to crash," the bug report reads. The crash is currently impacting players on all platforms, and Arrowhead is investigating a fix.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 x Halo: ODST - Legendary Warbond Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>For now, thankfully the crash is not too difficult to get around. To avoid any possibility of this crash ocurring, Arrowhead recommends equipping the ODST from the loadout instead of the armory.</p><p>The studio has also notified of another issue impacting Warbonds--Helldivers 2's equivalent of a battle pass. Arrowhead has warned that players may be unable to spend Super Credits while they are holding onto a Warbond Token. Until the issue is resolved, players will have to choose between saving their Warbond Token for a future Premium Warbond and holding off on purchases, or using it on a current Warbond they don't own yet and spending Super Credits as usual.</p><p>The Halo: ODST Warbond was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">Helldivers 2's first "Legendary Warbond,"</a> rewarding players with more items than a standard one--including four weapons, two armor sets, and plenty more. The Halo crossover dropped on the same day as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/" data-ref-id="1100-6534266">Helldivers 2's Xbox launch</a>, a combination that has brought a lot of new and returning players to the game.</p>

                <p> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>'s next update The Third Edict is set to add a whole new act, region, and plenty of other new content to the game--but it's the new asynchronous trading system that really has players excited. Grinding Gear Games has shown off the system's new in-game market browser, just days out from the update drop.</p><p>GGG explains in the video that the in-game trade browser wasn't quite ready to be shown off when the studio did its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">initial content drop</a> for The Third Edict, but it's now ready to go. The in-game market browser works similarly to PoE 2's official trade website, allowing players to search for items they want in the player-to-player trade system. The new asynchronous trade system means the seller no longer has to be online for a trade to take place--buyers can now purchase it directly from the seller's Hideout.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q972GGaOMBM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q972GGaOMBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The seemingly simple feature brings a major quality-of-life improvement for PoE 2 players, simplifying what was previously a fairly involved, multi-step process into an easier task. The asynchronous trade system is set to come to the original Path of Exile in future too, provided its integration into PoE 2 goes smoothly.</p><p>As a whole, The Third Edict update is full of quality-of-life changes, with the GGG devs setting out to take "a good crack at solving every problem people are currently unhappy about," as game director Johnathan Rogers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-path-of-exile-2-huge-third-edict-update-looks-to-deal-with-every-problem-upsetting-fans/1100-6534132/" data-ref-id="1100-6534132">said in a Q&amp;A</a>. The update also includes the addition of Act IV, new endgame content, a sprint ability, PoE 2's first league, and heaps more.</p><p>Despite the massive update, Path of Exile 2 doesn't seem likely to leave early access--or subsequently going free-to-play--anytime soon. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-wont-leave-early-access-in-2025-dont-believe-thats-possible-anymore/1100-6534129/" data-ref-id="1100-6534129">developers have said</a> it doesn't look possible for PoE 2 to get to a full release in 2025, and how long it remains in early access after that it will depend on the state of the game.</p><p>The Third Edict <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2s-next-major-content-update-the-third-edict-gets-release-date-and-twitch-drops/1100-6533991/" data-ref-id="1100-6533991">releases on August 29</a>, and PoE 2 will have a free access weekend from August 29 to September 1 along with the update's launch.</p>

                <p>In case you needed any more confirmation that Criterion is now all in on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield</a>, the Burnout creator and long-time Need For Speed custodian is now officially branded as "A Battlefield Studio"--leaving the future of the Need For Speed franchise in question.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/burnout-creator-need-for-speed-developer-criterion-renamed-battlefield-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, a user from the Need For Speed subreddit spotted Criterion's new official subtitle on EA's website, where "A Battlefield Studio" now appears under the usual studio logo. Members of the subreddit are understandably not too optimistic about what the change means for the Need For Speed franchise, which is still ostensibly under Criterion's purview.</p><p>The rebranding is really just confirming what we already knew--in February this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/need-for-speed-isnt-dead-but-criterion-is-focused-on-road-ahead-with-battlefield/1100-6529198/" data-ref-id="1100-6529198">EA announced</a> that Criterion was being moved under the Battlefield Studios banner in order to support the single-player experience for Battlefield 6. At the same time, it was announced that development on the next Need For Speed title was being paused--though EA has promised that the franchise is not dead.</p><p>Criterion has worked on Need for Speed titles since 2010's Hot Pursuit, and has been the main developer on the series since 2020, when control was shifted back from Ghost Games. The studio released Need for Speed Unbound in 2022, but in subsequent years a majority of the staff were assigned to support the Battlefield series following restructuring within EA.</p><p>While EA has said that it plans to bring the Need for Speed franchise back in the future, it's unclear whether future games will still be developed by Criterion, now that it's been designated under Battlefield Studios. It's no surprise that Battlefield 6 is the focus of EA's attention at present, with the much-hyped shooter due to release on October 10, 2025.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/acclaim-is-coming-back-as-game-publisher-focused-on-reviving-classic-franchises/1100-6529576/" data-ref-id="1100-6529576">a revived version of Acclaim</a> brought back one of the most prolific video game publishers from the '90s. Now, the resurrected company has announced that its first-ever Play Acclaim showcase will unveil its first new titles in over two decades next month.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYGvAEcV_tY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jYGvAEcV_tY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Play Acclaim is slated to be streamed on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayAcclaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the company's official YouTube channel</a> on September 10 11:30 AM PT/2:30 PM ET. The teaser video for Play Acclaim features several classic games the original company brought to consoles in the '90s, including Mortal Kombat 2, NBA Jam, Terminator 2, and more. It notably ends with some of Neo's final lines from The Matrix.</p><p>"We're not here to chase ghosts," said Acclaim CEO Alex Josef in a statement. "We're here to take the energy and chaos that made Acclaim unforgettable and channel it into something new. The old screens are cracking, and what's coming through is something exciting and different ... You can't rewrite the past, but you can build upon it. This is about owning our story and moving it into a future that feels bold, energetic, and completely fresh."</p><p>When the new version of Acclaim was announced last March, the company promised to "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises." It's unclear which--if any--of the licensed games and franchises from the teaser trailer will be a part of Acclaim's future.  </p><p>WWE, TNA, and AEW veteran wrestler Jeff Jarrett is part of Acclaim's leadership team alongside Josef, and a partnership between Striker Entertainment, Ridge Partners, Global Force Entertainment, VaynerFund, and JET Management.</p>
