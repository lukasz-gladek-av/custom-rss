                <p>Studio Chaf has announced that it is shutting down its debut game, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790930/Velev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Velev</a>, days after it launched into Steam Early Access on April 9.</p><p>"As some of you may have already noticed, we weren't able to reach the point we needed to continue supporting and servicing Velev," the development team said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2790930/view/574879683755115731" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Despite our best efforts, we couldn't secure the investment we needed from VCs or larger partners. With limited options, we made the decision to launch in Early Access, hoping for the best."</p><p>Chalf added that the studio understood that Velev wasn't in the best state when it launched as a paid early access title on Steam. However, it was the only viable path forward in order to continue development. Unfortunately, Chaf is stepping away from development and bringing Velev to a close.</p><p>Velev is also transitioning to a free-to-play model, with all purchases being fully refunded. While the game's server will shut down eventually, a specific date hasn't been determined yet.</p><p>Velev is a game that has both PvP MOBA arena action as well as PvE gameplay. Players assume the role of an explorer who stumbles upon a void within the Earth, stepping into a new world where technology and nature coexist in harmony.</p><p>While not the exact same situation, the disastrous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-before-studio-shuts-down-days-after-disastrous-launch/1100-6519871/" data-ref-id="1100-6519871">early access launch of The Day Before</a> caused its developer Fntastic to shut down the game mere days after its launch.</p><p>Steam also recently added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-offers-notice-for-early-access-games-that-havent-been-updated-in-months/1100-6529265/" data-ref-id="1100-6529265">new notice for early access games</a>. If a game in early access hasn't been updated in several months, its Steam page will now mention that. This gives potential buyers a clear warning that a game they're about to purchase hasn't been updated or supported in a while.</p>

href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-coming-in-2025-according-to-leaks-3179371/" rel="nofollow ">reported by Dexerto</a>, new Call of Duty leaks came from a Reddit post by someone named Bigbyy, who claimed they were part of a study group assembled by Activision to see what the average player might be excited about for the next Call of Duty game. The Redditor claimed the story is set in 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black Ops 2 campaign, bringing back the characters Woods and Mason. The campaign is reported to have "up to four player co-op" and an open world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the Call of Duty 2025 leaks provided by Bigbyy do align with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">original leaks from Insider Gaming</a>, and it also offers new details that suggest exciting news for Zombies fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The leaker claimed Zombies mode will have the "largest round-based map ever created," a remake of the Tranzit map from Black Ops 2, and feature a difficulty slider. As for the story details, the leaks suggest a focus on the original Zombies crew and "an exploration of the old timelines." Treyarch added Richtofen back into the Zombies storyline for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but it's been several years since Dempsey, Nikolai, or Takeo were featured.</p><p dir="ltr">The multiplayer maps Bigbyy said were shown to the study group included many older maps from the Black Ops series, but they were ported into a new futuristic Japanese setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The post also reported that Call of Duty 2025 will continue to feature Treyarch's omnimovement in all game modes, in addition to a new wall-running mechanic. Call of Duty's "Carry Forward" program is rumored to return, which would transfer the weapons and operators from Black Ops 6 into Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The original post from Bigbyy has since been deleted, and with this being leaked from an alleged study group, it's possible that any of this information could change prior to launch. We're probably a long way away from an official announcement from Activision, but until then, we have highlighted all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">rumors and details about Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, Call of Duty recently added the stoner duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/">Jay and Silent Bob as playable operators in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>. Season 3 just brought back the OG Verdansk map, and it's been<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-just-hit-a-2025-record-on-steam-following-verdansks-return-to-warzone/1100-6530610/"> successful in driving players back to Warzone</a>.</p>
