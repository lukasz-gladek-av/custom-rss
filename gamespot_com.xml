                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> is currently in its second weekend, and players are still adsorbing the latest entry to the franchise. Meanwhile, Digital Foundry has shared its technical breakdown from the first weekend of Battlefield 6's open beta, and the early verdict is very good.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDVDQbgL3Rs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDVDQbgL3Rs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's not to say that the open beta was flawless. In the opening minutes alone, DF broke down some of the issues with the destructible environments. There are occasional glitches, including pieces of rubble floating in air without being connected to the structure around them. Battlefield 6's buildings appear to fall apart using a state-based system rather than registering unique damage or breaking points. Yet it's still an improvement over Battlefield 2049 and Battlefield 5.</p><p>Visually, DF saw the best results when running the SSGI option on PC, which allowed for more natural lighting, and suggested that this feature should be included for PlayStation 5 Pro. Unsurprisingly, the PS5 Pro performed better than the standard PS5, but the gap wasn't as great as it was between the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. In a side-by-side comparison, the S noticeably struggled to keep up with the on-screen details that the X handled more smoothly.</p><p>Even in the beta's current state, DF said that Battlefield 6 "is very shippable at the moment" and added that it has "a level of mechanical polish that feels top-notch." However, DF added that the game could really use some raytracing embellishments and that it doesn't feel innovative in the way that some of the previous titles have.</p><p>Among players, one of the current complaints is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">the size of the 12v12 Rush mode</a> is too small, but the final game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may solve that issue. Regardless, Battlefield 6's beta has already passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a>, as well as the record of the previous Battlefield games on Steam. The second Battlefield 6 open beta will conclude on August 17.</p>
