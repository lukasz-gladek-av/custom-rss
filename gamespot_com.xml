                <p dir="ltr">InZoi is set to launch in early access tomorrow, and developer InZoi Studio is hoping its Sims-like life simulator can challenge EA's juggernaut right from the jump. After a controversy stirred regarding mods, however, one lead dev took to Steam to announce the removal of the DRM program Denuvo from the upcoming build, in a bid to quell disappointment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353752633?l=english" rel="nofollow ">statement on InZoi's official Steam page</a>, game director and producer Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim confirmed that Denuvo will not be part of InZoi's early-access launch after "consulting with teams from around the world to make a thoughtful and informed decision." Kim says that the decision to use Denuvo was initially to prevent "illegal distribution," but that including the program would ultimately not serve the community at large.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465832"></a><figcaption>InZoi</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4465832-inzoi.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We understand that removing Denuvo increases the risk of the game being cracked and illegally distributed after release," Kim said in the statement. "At the same time, we believe it opens up a valuable opportunity: It allows InZoi to become more freely configurable--unlocking new ways for players to shape new experiences for other players. We believe enabling this freedom from the very beginning will lead to innovative and long-lasting enjoyment for the community."</p><p dir="ltr">Kim also apologized to the community for the controversy, saying they "regret the concern and confusion this has caused within the community, and weâ€™re committed to rebuilding your trust as we move forward in developing the best possible experience." He also reiterated that the team is "committed to making InZoi a highly moddable game."</p><p dir="ltr">The change in direction comes after a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2456740/discussions/0/599648005874810809/">Steam community forum post</a> mentioned that mods for InZoi would only allow for cosmetic mods--skins, clothing, etc. Specifically, the game's terms of service said that "certain content provided by the Company includes elements that you are not permitted to modify or alter at your discretion" and that players are "prohibited from making any modifications, whether in whole or in part, to such content."</p><p>InZoi launches in early access March 27 on Steam. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/">InZoi Online Showcase livestream</a> aired last week, which showed the team's initial plans for the game, including a full roadmap of what's to expect in the coming weeks.</p>

                <p>Actor Jack Black is a big fan of video games, but what games specifically does he get immersed in? In an interview, the A Minecraft Movie star sang the praises of Rockstar Games' acclaimed 2018 game Red Dead Redemption II, saying he played the title for hundreds of hours during the pandemic.</p><p>"It was over pandemic times. I played Red Dead Redemption 2, and I lived in it," he told <a href="https://comicbook.com/interviews/news/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-gaming-history-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "It was not a game. It was like a way of life. I got 400 hours clocked, and it was a lot, and I don't regret any of it. It was so fun. It's beautiful out there, it's an incredible universe they created."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8B1EtVPBSMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8B1EtVPBSMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is just the latest video game film for Black, as he also played Bowser in The Super Mario Bros. Movie. In video games themselves, Black is perhaps best known for portraying Eddie Riggs in Brutal Legend.</p><p>Black appeared in the interview alongside his A Minecraft Movie co-star Jason Momoa, who said he had never heard of Red Dead Redemption 2; this elicited a shocked response from Black.</p><p>"Dude, you never heard of Rockstar Games? These guys are the artists. You have to play it; it'll change your life. If you play one game, that's the one," he said.</p><p>Asked about his own favorite games, Momoa said he chooses to generally "stay away" from games due to what he said was a "pretty addictive personality." He did say he enjoyed Capcom's popular Street Fighter series, saying Ryu and Blanka are his two favorite characters.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie releases in theaters on April 4. It's been a long time coming, as the film has been in the works for more than a decade, bouncing between directors like Rob McElhenney and Shawn Levy before finally finding Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess. In addition to Black and Momoa, the film stars Danielle Brooks, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Hansen.</p><p>It's not the only video game movie coming in April, as Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/until-dawn-movie-gets-a-key-update-about-its-story/1100-6528665/" data-ref-id="1100-6528665">Until Dawn film arrives on April 25</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">A Shinto shrine that's believed to have influenced a similar location in Ghost of Tsushima has reportedly banned tourists after an undisclosed incident involving foreigners. Named Watazumi Shrine, the Japanese site is found on Tsushima Island, which sits to the southeast of South Korea.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> reports that an official announcement by Watazumi Shrine <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tsushima_watadzumijinja/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">on Instagram</a> revealed the ban, stating it's taking effect because of "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)." No further details were given about the incident, though this apparently isn't the first time problems have occurred at the site. It's believed that Watazumi Shrine was the inspiration for Ghost of Tsushima's Scarlet Rock Shrine.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="577297634" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

typhoon in 2020, per <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202012/21211686.html" rel="nofollow ">Famitsu</a>. However, to be clear, there is no indication that the incident is in any way related to the PlayStation game's fanbase. This isn't the only shrine controversy in video games.

The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-is-getting-an-anime-adaptation/1100-6528657/">getting an anime adaptation</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wick-director-gives-an-update-on-the-ghost-of-tsushima-movie/1100-6518807/" data-ref-id="1100-6518807">a movie has been in development with Johh Wick director Chad Shahelski</a>.

                <p>CD Projekt has signed a deal to work with Pokemon Go owner Scopely to make a game based on one of the Polish company's franchises. CD Projekt made the announcement during its latest financial briefing, but didn't elaborate much on the deal.</p><p>Scopely, which is owned by Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games, is primarily a mobile game developer. Management was asked to share more details on this deal with Scopely during the earnings call, but declined to discuss the matter.</p><p>Scopely is one of the biggest mobile game companies on the planet, and recently entered a new stratosphere of success with Monopoly Go.</p><p>In March, Niantic sold its video game division, including Pokemon Go, to Scopely for $3.5 billion--this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 biggest gaming acquisition in history</a>. Before that, Savvy Games bought Scopely in 2023 for $4.9 billion--that was the No. 6 biggest gaming acquisition of all time.</p><p>In 2024, CD Projekt said it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-and-witcher-mobile-games-could-come-in-the-future-cd-projekt-says/1100-6522276/" data-ref-id="1100-6522276">considering the possibility of making The Witcher and/or Cyberpunk mobile games.</a> The company does have experience with the mobile market, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gwent-the-witcher-card-game/" data-ref-id="5000-455324">Gwent: The Witcher Card Game</a> received mobile ports, though support for the title ended in October 2023. Another Witcher mobile game, the Pokemon Go-inspired <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-monster-slayer/" data-ref-id="5000-517724">The Witcher: Monster Slayer</a>, released in July 2021 but shut down nearly two years later in 2023.</p><p>As for CD Projekt's other upcoming projects, we just learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">The Witcher 4 is not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>.
