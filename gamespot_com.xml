                <p>Remember <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-reveal-bully-online-bringing-multiplayer-to-the-20-year-old-game/1100-6535760/" data-ref-id="1100-6535760">Bully Online</a>, that fan-made mod that introduced online multiplayer to Rockstar Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, which launched in mid-December 2025? Well, if you didn't get the chance to play it when it came out, then you never will, because it has been shut down forever.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/TheNathanNS/status/2011478101419544964/photo/1" rel="nofollow ">a Discord post by a moderator named Yubari</a>, everything--the Bully Online project, the official Discord server, script development, source code, webpages, launcher, and all Bully Online account data--has been permanently deleted as of January 14. The YouTube video announcing the project's release has been privated, the Ko-Fi page has been removed, and any other Bully Online-related material is also unavailable. The ship has faded into the fog, if you will.</p><p>There's no explanation for why this happened just yet. However, Yubari noted that "this was not something [the team] wanted." YouTuber, developer, "massive Bully fan," and Bully Online project lead, SWEGTA, <a href="https://x.com/SWEGTA/status/2011478849431687225" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X on January 14</a> that he'll "make a proper statement on the situation" in a YouTube video he'll post on January 21.</p><p>The speculation among fans of Bully Online, though, is that the team may have received a cease and desist from either developer Rockstar Vancouver or its parent company, Take-Two Interactive, perhaps for attempting to monetize assets created by Rockstar. We'll find out when SWEGTA comments on the situation next week.</p><p>Bully Online was a mod for Rockstar's 2006 high school menacing sim Bully. The mod allowed you to play minigames, role-play, compete in races, fend off against NPCs, and more--all with your friends and strangers online. It also featured free-roaming, a "fleshed-out" inventory system, and in-game currencies so you can buy goodies like housing, items, and vehicles. It essentially resembled GTA Online and RDR Online, but in an unofficial capacity. And now, it's gone forever. RIP.</p>

                <p>Bad news for fans of The Jumping Burger: the PlayStation Store has excised the game, along with over 1,000 similar titles published by the same developer, in what appears to be an effort to clear the storefront of shovelware.</p><p>German publisher ThiGames had its <a href="https://www.thigames.de/links" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entire catalog</a> of at least 1,196 games silently delisted. The company, as pointed out by streamer and "trophy hunter" <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RobThanatos</a> on X, published the fourth-highest number of titles on the PlayStation Store. ThiGames has yet to publicly acknowledge the removals.</p><p>One quick look at any of these games and it's easy to conclude that they're nothing more than easy ways to farm trophies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_deM452thA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Gameplay" of The Jumping Burger</a> consists of pressing or holding the cross button to make a burger jump up and down, earning a Platinum trophy for players in less than five minutes. A totally separate game called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ6XQmH_-PE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Jumping Burger: Turbo</a> shortened this process down to less than a minute and a half.</p><p>ThiGames had an entire cafeteria selection of jumping-food games, including The Jumping Taco, The Jumping Pizza, The Jumping Churros, and The Jumping Nuggets. The publisher also released platformers and racing games that also took mere minutes to earn a Platinum trophy. These games only <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/all-games/1?publisher=ThiGames" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cost around $1.50 to $3 on the PlayStation Store</a> when they were available, and the publisher regularly offered discounted deals for them--presumably to attract attention during big storewide sales.</p><p>Last year, Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-removes-shovelware-slop-psn-store-ps5-ps4-1851759704" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed over 30 purported "slop" games</a> from publisher RandomSpin. The move came shortly after an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> report put a spotlight on a mass of cheap, low-quality games on major digital storefronts, many of which were accused of being asset flips, containing AI-generated content, or having misleading titles and descriptions.</p><p>Nintendo also seemingly made a move against the wave of slop last year, changing the way Nintendo eShop ranks games in an apparent effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-key-change-to-the-switch-eshop-that-you-might-have-missed/1100-6531267/" data-ref-id="1100-6531267">de-prioritize lower-priced shovelware</a>.</p>

                <p>The use of generative AI in video games has been controversial to say the least, but when it comes to art, the blowback has been even stronger. One game currently being accused of using the technology is<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves/"> Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</a>, as the new trailer for the fighting game's upcoming second season of DLC characters is being picked apart online. Viewers and commenters have pored over the trailer, claiming that the character designs are inconsistent and that certain visual elements contain generative AI. The biggest smoking gun, according to viewers, is a quick shot of series antagonist Geese Howard, who appears to be missing an entire foot.</p><p>Other instances of generative AI pointed out include Blue Mary's motorcycle missing several vital components--and being a completely different model from what she normally rides--and Kim Jae Hoon having noticeably different wardrobes between his cinematic and gameplay character models. We have reached out to the developer, SNK, for details on the trailer and will update this post as soon as we hear back.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqe1RBmJ9S8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tqe1RBmJ9S8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If Fatal Fury is using generative AI, it wouldn't be the first game to do so. Activision confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/">AI tools were used in the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, but it has insisted that the creative process "continues to be led" by humans. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-ai-generated-art-just-like-call-of-duty-fans-believe/1100-6537131/">fans believe that Battlefield 6 </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-ai-generated-art-just-like-call-of-duty-fans-believe/1100-6537131/">features AI-generated art</a>, and the Indie Game Awards rescinded the awards given to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 after it was discovered that developer Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/">used AI-generated assets during the game's production</a>.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios has also faced backlash after it was revealed that it had been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/">experimenting with AI tools for concept art</a>. Studio CEO Swen Vincke later addressed the controversy and explained that the studio will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-draws-harder-line-on-ai-clarifies-stance-in-reddit-ama/1100-6537296/">avoid using generative AI</a> entirely in concept-art creation for its next game, Divinity.</p>

For instance, Super Mario World players might know that bringing Yoshi into the last battle with Bowser shouldn't be possible. Well, it's not without a glitch putting the green dinosaur in the reserve item box--which houses power-ups like the Cape Feather or mushroom. The latter comes into play to consume Peach, as timing is important to have Yoshi trying to eat that as the mushroom falls and then it's replaced with the princess. Basically, this isn't an easy trick to pull off while defeating Bowser.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MarioBrothBlog/status/2011493949412982845" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Using a combination of glitches in Super Mario World, Yoshi can be taken into the final battle, where he can eat Peach upon Bowser's defeat.
