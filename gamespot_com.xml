                <p>If you've ever been on a ride at any of the major theme parks, then you should know that they can and will break at the most inopportune times. But at least one guest at Universal Studios' Super Nintendo World took full advantage of the Mario Kart ride's breakdown by lighting up a joint.</p><p>The <a href="https://x.com/highuniversal/status/1948103349171286376?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Universal High account on X</a> (via <a href="https://wdwnt.com/2025/07/guest-smokes-weed-mario-kart-universal-studios-hollywood/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WDWNT</a>), posted a video online of a guest riding the Mario Kart: Bowser's Challenge attraction during a stoppage. And as seen in the clip below, the guest lights up and smokes a little weed while waiting for the ride to resume.</p><p>Universal High was quick to point out that the video was first posted by someone else on Instagram, but that original video appears to have been removed. The currently unidentified fan does have some distinctive tattoos on his hand and thumb. But it's unclear if the individual was spotted by any of the park's employees or removed for lighting the joint.</p><p>Earlier this year, Universal Orland's new theme park, Epic Universe, opened up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-nintendo-worlds-donkey-kong-country-brings-pure-joy-to-epic-universe/1100-6530812/" data-ref-id="1100-6530812">an expanded Super Nintendo World</a>. Two of the latest attractions include Donkey Kong's Mine-Cart Madness and Yoshi Adventurer, as well as new things to find with the Power Up Bands worn by guests in the park.</p><p>Epic Universe also features four other new areas to explore, including Celestial Park, Wizarding World of Harry Potter: Ministry of Magic, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-monsters-live-again-as-epic-universe-reveals-horrifying-dark-universe-animatronics/1100-6527459/" data-ref-id="1100-6527459">Dark Universe</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-reveals-epic-universes-how-to-train-your-dragon-land/1100-6522255/" data-ref-id="1100-6522255">How to Train Your Dragon-Isle of Berk</a>.</p>

With support for one to four players, the strategy game has you guiding a small band of survivors to victory--which can be achieved in multiple ways.

The challenging board game is seeing a <strong>$20 discount right now</strong>--and with games lasting around two hours, it's an excellent choice for an extended (and intense) game night.</p><p>Alternatively, console players can prep for Frostpunk 2 by diving into the original Frostpunk.

And if you're a fan of survival games and city builders, it should be more than enough to keep you busy until September 18.</p><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot and Fanatical are both owned by Fandom.</em></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/adam-sandler-happy-gilmore-billy-madison-4k-blu-ray-editions-preorder-amazon/1100-6531820/">Happy Gilmore And Billy Madison 4K Blu-Ray Preorders Steeply Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdos-new-50-iphone-controller-is-officially-licensed-by-xbox/1100-6533127/">8BitDo's New $50 iPhone Controller Is Officially Licensed By Xbox</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Anyone seeking a portable, powerful, and reliable laptop will find it to check all the right boxes, although it's unclear how long the discount will last. Apple products don't often see price cuts this big, so be sure to check this out while you can.</p><div title="6533494 - 2025 MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4)" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3982" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533494 - 2025 MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4)" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20">2025 MacBook Air (13-Inch, M4)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DZDCPMGK?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$799 (was $999)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Equipped with 16GB memory, 256GB SSD, and the powerful M4 chip, this version of the MacBook Air is an excellent choice for a young professional, student, or as the central computing hub for your family to stream videos, surf the web, or send emails.

                <p>Xbox has expanded its game streaming perk for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Starting today, July 28, players can now stream their Xbox library to their PCs directly through the Xbox PC app.</p><p>In recent years, Microsoft has added the ability to stream your Xbox library to many devices, including Xbox consoles, smart TVs, and browsers. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-july-update-more-ways-to-play/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> today that this functionality has finally been added to the Xbox app on PC, meaning that most Xbox-related functionality should now be available in the app.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563"></a><figcaption>Your Xbox library has gotten a fresh coat of paint across devices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg"></figure><p>Streaming Xbox games isn't just a neat way to access your Game Pass library when you're away from your console or home PC. It also lets PC-only players access Xbox console exclusives that haven't made their way to PC yet.</p><p>Microsoft has also rolled out a bunch of other upgrades for the Xbox PC app. These are highlighted by efforts to consolidate and streamline the cloud gaming process. The app surfaces cross-device play history, meaning that you can start playing a game on Xbox and pick up your progress via game streaming in the app. The app update also adds a more cohesive game library, combining all games available to stream across consoles, including both purchased games and those available via Game Pass. Both of these changes are currently available for members of the Xbox Insider program, which is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free to join and open for everyone.</a></p><p>Finally, the Xbox PC app now has an easier way to track Microsoft Rewards. Microsoft states that the new system will surface Rewards progress as you play, allowing you to track points across play sessions.</p>

                <p>F1 star Lewis Hamilton is just like many gamers in that he's very excited for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. Speaking to fans recently, Hamilton listed off some of his favorite games, going on to single out GTA 6 as a game that he's so amped for that he's planning to "cancel all my work" when it releases.</p><p>"I'm a big gamer. I play a lot of Call of Duty, for sure... but I like Assassin’s Creed, Gran Turismo," he said. "I'm dying for the new Grand Theft Auto to come out. GTA 6! Yeah, that's the one I'm waiting for. I'll have to cancel all my work when that game comes out."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-hype-is-so-big-f1-drivers-are-canceling-work-for-it-3231088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto points out</a>, there is a small break in the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/formula-1-reveals-calendar-for-2026-season.YctbMZWqBvrgyddrnauo8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2026 F1 schedule</a> around the time that GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026, so that might work out nicely for Hamilton.</p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to be released in Fall 2025 before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">delayed it to May 2026 to help give it more polish. </a></p><p>"In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach," Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said. "While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection."</p><p>GTA 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/">PC version is expected to be released at a later date</a>.</p>
