                <p>Earlier today, Bethesda Game Studios shared its Fallout Day Broadcast. And while there wasn't a new Fallout game, there were a lot of Fallout-related announcements. Coming up first is the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, which will arrive just in time for the game's 10th anniversary next month.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zKeAbOFFeE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3zKeAbOFFeE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will feature 150 pieces of Creation Club content, as well as the six official add-ons, and Creations, which will allow console and PC users to find even more content. The Anniversary Edition is dropping on November 10 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC. If you already have Fallout 4, the Anniversary Upgrade will be available on all platforms. Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers will also have the option to access the DLC and Creations content. Additionally, Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition will be ported to Switch 2 in 2026.</p><p>On October 23, the Bethesda Gear Store will be taking preorders for Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary Bundle. This package will only be available for PC players, and it will include a code for Fallout: New Vegas Ultimate Edition, as well as the following collectibles:</p><ul><li>8-inch PVC statue of Victor</li><li>Doc Mitchell's Evaluation Cards</li><li>Vault Boy enamel pin</li><li>Mojave Express patch</li><li>NCR Recon patch</li><li>Collector's Big Box</li></ul><p>It's not the modern remaster of Fallout: New Vegas <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/danny-trejo-wants-a-fallout-new-vegas-remaster-and-wants-it-now/1100-6535647/" data-ref-id="1100-6535647">that actor Danny Trejo really wants to see</a>, but it's a start.</p><p>Fallout 76 is set to graduate to the current console generation with new ports for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 in early 2026. PS4 and Xbox One players will also get new optimizations. In the meantime, Bethesda is launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-expansion-is-adding-the-ghoul-from-prime-videos-fallout-series/1100-6535155/" data-ref-id="1100-6535155">the Burning Springs update</a> for Fallout 76 on December 2.

                <p>The upcoming Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> hasn't exactly been a well-kept secret. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-sees-another-switch-2-listing-pop-up/1100-6535394/" data-ref-id="1100-6535394">Listings popped up online</a>, and there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/" data-ref-id="1100-6535405">a leak earlier this month</a> that suggested the release date would be December 5. It turns out that was just off by three days. Ubisoft and Nintendo have now officially revealed that Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit Switch 2 on December 2, and the news was accompanied by a launch trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzyD_EFZzgc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OzyD_EFZzgc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Despite some rumors that suggested a $70 price to match the other consoles, Switch 2's Assassin's Creed Shadows will retail for $60. However, it will be on a game-key card unless purchased directly from the eShop as a download. There will also be premium edition for $100 that will only be available digitally.</p><p>At launch, the Switch 2 port will have all of the content updates released since the game's debut except for the first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Claws of Awaji</a>. Switch 2 users will have to wait until 2026 for that. However, the Switch 2 version will support cross-platform progression through Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>"We are delighted to bring Assassin's Creed Shadows to Nintendo players," game director Charles Benoit said in a statement. "Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>An update released for Shadows in September added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-adds-what-we-all-wanted-a-cat-dressed-like-ezio/1100-6534658/" data-ref-id="1100-6534658">a cat dressed like Enzio</a>, one of the fan-favorite characters in the Assassin's Creed franchise. A recent report revealed that Ubisoft began developing an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Assassin's Creed title set during the American Civil War</a> and the Reconstruction era. However, the project was canceled because it was considered to be too controversial.</p>

                <p>A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">48% of all gamers</a>, by the way--simply can't stop talking.</p><p>Accompanied by the caption "Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning," <a href="https://v45.tiktokcdn-us.com/089da21650d5c53cd0ece9bdffdedac2/68fd05f3/video/tos/useast8/tos-useast8-ve-0068c002-tx2/oEix9o0qfABiQjBlEpAbswEAGiRgfmoBCViIE6/?a=1233&amp;bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&amp;ch=0&amp;cr=3&amp;dr=0&amp;lr=all&amp;cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C&amp;cv=1&amp;br=1858&amp;bt=929&amp;cs=0&amp;ds=3&amp;ft=4KLxRMzm8Zmo0TugXI4jVXOeQpWrKsd.&amp;mime_type=video_mp4&amp;qs=0&amp;rc=M2c5ZjQ8OWg3Omg3aTw7ZUBpMzVyO2s5cmx5NTMzaTczNEBhMi1hXzIwXjExMzFgMzM2YSNxMmxsMmRzYGFhLS1kMTJzcw%3D%3D&amp;vvpl=1&amp;l=202510231716183F8AFA4B6A9D6205A3D7&amp;btag=e000bd000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the ad</a> (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: "Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off." As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.</p><p>Considering Razer's history of making <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/kraken-kitty-line?srsltid=AfmBOorPF5lRBMw9zdVmy9cmMGcbxDiM02bQkIhk8yRN4bujxcZAvGeP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute accessories geared towards female audiences</a>, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent study</a> by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a "nearly equal gender split" among video game players.</p><p>The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like "welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years," "I just put my razer headphones in the bin," and "the casual misogyny is INSANE" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, "razer's sexist btw."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shown a bit more of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, though apparently by accident. Two 15-second commercials for the Switch 2 were found, both unlisted on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, and one includes a brief glimpse of a boss fight that we haven't seen before. Those hypersensitive to spoilers should turn away.</p><p>Both unlisted videos, uploaded on October 15, are titled "Power Up Your Holidays," with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZEWTy9xpk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first video</a> showcasing the previously seen plant-like boss Carvex. But more noteworthy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second video</a>, which emphasizes the Switch 2 version's use of mouse controls and 120fps support, while also giving us our first look at a boss called Xelios. And this boss is spherical!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtEt0Cudt8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grtEt0Cudt8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We only see it for a few seconds, but Xelios appears to be composed of several hexagonal plates that can shift around, with a green sac and pink core at its center. Presumably, you as Samus Aran will have to blast that pink center to hell whenever this sphere-like boss exposes it.</p><p>With only slivers of information to go on, there aren't too many conclusions about the story and events of Metroid Prime 4 we can make, but the existence of Xelios confirms a couple of trends.</p><p>First, there's a clear naming indication with these bosses, with the early-game enemy Aberax (as seen in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W9xes7BZto?si=4oERcI-JJq88Ev7d&amp;t=683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>) and the aforementioned Carvex and Xelios. They, along with the main villain Sylux, all have the letter X in their names, not unlike the members of Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts. Don't expect any crazy crossover, though.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yz3tTS0xPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, footage of the Aberax fight shows the enemy being possessed by a Metroid before it attacks Samus, gaining new abilities and green sacs and pink nuclei similar to those of Metroids. It's possible that the other bosses we've seen are also fused with Metroids. Whatever the case is, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 is heavily emphasizing the "Metroid" part of the title.</p><p>Both commercial videos are still unlisted, but they indicate that Nintendo is priming (pun intended) the game for holiday-season marketing of the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">out just in time for the holidays</a> on December 4, but fans eager to digest anything Metroid-related can look forward to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-1-3-trilogy-visual-retrospective-book-preorder-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3 visual retrospective book</a> this month.</p>
