                <p>No one is doing more for mascot platformers than Toys for Bob. Since 2018, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">formerly Microsoft-owned studio</a> has released the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot 4, and Crash Team Rumble, reinvigorating two beloved but largely stagnant franchises. Now, Toys for Bob co-studio head and creative director Paul Yan says the studio has its eyes on another iconic platforming series: Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanadianGuyE</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">h</a>--which was then reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/since-going-independent-of-activision-microsoft-and-xbox-studio-toys-for-bob-says-theyd-love-to-work-on-a-banjo-kazooie-in-a-new-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>--Yan discussed Toys for Bob's upcoming projects. On top of seemingly teasing a new entry in the Spyro the Dragon series, Yan expressed the team's desire to work with Xbox on bringing back the dynamic bird and bear duo, Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>"One company we'd like to work with is one we're already working with--Team Xbox! They've been a great partner and they also have a very interesting roster of characters that Toys for Bob could have a lot of fun with. The honey bear is the first one that comes to mind--I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right?" Yan said.</p><p>Though this certainly doesn't mean a Banjo-Kazooie remake or reboot is already in the works, Toys for Bob's past work and relationship with Xbox makes this collaboration seem more like a matter of "when" than "if." Despite the studio breaking apart from the Microsoft-owned studio Activision back in 2023, it has continued to work closely with Xbox, and is currently collaborating with the company on an upcoming project that many <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/spyro-4-rumours-toys-for-bob-tease/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculate to be Spyro the Dragon 4</a>. Though Yan said he "can't spill the beans just yet" on the upcoming project, he assured fans that development is going well.</p><p>"I will say that we're very much in the thick of development. The team is very thrilled about how the experience is shaping up. This game is big and ambitious and pushes our craft to new heights."</p><p>Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">leaving Activision</a>, Toys for Bob had been moved from working on the whimsical platformers it's known for to assist the Call of Duty series as a support studio. According to a former senior concept artist, Nicholas Kole, the team was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">forced to scrap Crash Bandicoot 5</a>. After 86 employees were laid off from the studio as a part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft's 2023 mass layoffs</a>, the studio sought, and was given, independence.</p>

                <p>Anyone familiar with Nintendo's favorite gourmand Kirby knows that the pink blob has an insatiable appetite. Ordinarily, a little bit of gluttony isn't a bad thing, but in Kirby's case, it has quite the transformative effect on him--quite literally!

The underside of the cushioned headband features a colorful collage of characters from the Kirby universe. The left earcup shows Kirby preparing to inhale the headphones, while the right earcup displays Kirby's "mouthful" face.</p><p>As for the audio specs and performance, these are basic 3.5mm stereo headphones with 50mm dynamic speaker drivers and a detachable boom mic. There are much higher-performing wired headsets with customizable audio features for similar prices, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackShark-V2-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09PZG4R17?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer BlackShark V2 X</a> for $35 (was $60) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0B8Q4CR52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1</a> for $49 (was $60).

                <p>One of the biggest talking points surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> since its official announcement has been focused on the price of the console and its games--some believe the prices are simply too much.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSu0BQFTFPA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayerDriven</a>, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said Nintendo can charge what it wants for new first-party Switch 2 games because Nintendo makes compelling games. Some people might perceive the price increase for a game like Mario Kart World ($80) as being "hefty," Layden said, but in the end, people will buy it anyway.</p><p>"If it's the only place where you can play Mario, then you get your wallet out and you buy into it... and Donkey Kong and Zelda. That first-party exclusivity kind of mitigates the sticker shock, if you will, of these price hikes, because you want that content so bad," he said (<a

years.</p><p>"In 2025 dollars, $59.99 in 1999 is equivalent to $100. Your purchasing power compared to your cost of living, it's much smaller now than it was before, but still companies have been reluctant to push that price up," he said, adding that he thinks publishers should have charged $5 more for new games each new console generation.</p><p>Meanwhile, actor and video game developer Abubakar Salim told <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/abubakar-salim-why-price-of-games-accessible/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that inclusivity is an important consideration to remember in a conversation about general socioeconomic issues. Salim questioned why Nintendo is charging more for the Switch 2 console and games.</p><p>"We're in a very tough time at the moment, so why make it harder and have that bar eventually so high? Yeah, I was a bit upset about the price changes, because Nintendo is a family game, Nintendo is a family genre. It's a family platform," Salim said.</p><p>For Mario Kart World, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">defended the $80 price point</a> by saying the game is a worthy upgrade over Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and people will understand this after the April 17 Nintendo Direct. Meanwhile, others have said Nintendo chose to price Mario Kart World at $80 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-80-because-thats-what-people-will-pay-for-it-analyst-says/1100-6530715/" data-ref-id="1100-6530715">simply because it can.</a></p><p>At $450, the Switch 2 is about $50 more than the original Switch with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">inflation factored in</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is looking to experiment in 2025, ranging from its new seasonal content model, a major server-wide event unlike anything in the game's history, and even the ability to mix and match abilities from different classes to create something entirely new.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer ZeniMax Online revealed what's coming in the year ahead for its long-running MMORPG at a recent ESO Direct. In it, studio director Matt Firor reiterated much of what he said in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">end-of-year blog post</a> from December. Unlike every year since 2017's Morrowind chapter, 2025 will not see the release of a new expansion, but will instead see the game shift to a seasonal content model that Firor said will allow it more freedom to experiment when it comes to releasing new content and addressing the needs of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want to keep telling great stories, but also mix in new ideas and gameplay systems, and that's exactly what we're going to do," Firor said. "But we'll do this in a different cadence, one that allows us, the developers, to broaden our focus and increase variety."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Seasons Of The Worm Cult</h2><p dir="ltr">ESO game director Rich Lambert and executive producer Susan Kath then dove into what all will be coming in place of a new chapter. The game's first season under this new format will be Seasons of the Worm Cult, one that will actually serve as a decade-later sequel to the game's original Molag Bal storyline and will kick off in June. It will introduce a new zone, the isle of Solstice, where players will investigate the resurgence of Bal's Worm Cult and meet familiar faces from the game's first main quest along the way. The zone is home to outcast elves and Argonians, with Carribean-esque beaches and tropical forests for players to explore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473776" data-ratio="0.56253443526171" data-width="1815" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473776"></a><figcaption>The new Solstice zone sits off Tamriel's southern coast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473776-esosolsticebeach.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Though Seasons of the Worm Cult will last most of the year, Kath made clear that might not be the case for future seasons. In the years ahead, seasons could be shorter, ranging from three to six months. Those may take the form of "remix" seasons where ZeniMax Online revisits old storylines, with the developer teasing a Dark Brotherhood-themed season.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead of purchasing a new chapter, players will instead be able to purchase a $50 content pass that will include all of the year's upcoming seasonal updates, including new dungeons. The content pass will be separate from ESO's existing ESO Plus subscription, though all of Season of the Worm Cult's new dungeons will be included as part of ESO Plus. During a post-ESO Direct press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, Kath said the team was looking at ways to further add to and incentivize ESO Plus but did not announce any specifics.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Subclasses</h2><p dir="ltr">News that subclassing will be coming to ESO for all players in June is likely the biggest announcement. Regardless of which of the game's seven classes a player originally picked, they'll be able to select abilities from up to two skill lines from other classes to experiment with, with over 3,000 unique skill line combinations.</p><p dir="ltr">The ESO Direct and subsequent Q&amp;A didn't dive into many details, but ZeniMax Online did confirm players will need to keep at least one skill line from their original class. While one character can learn all the available non-main class skill lines, they'll only be able to actively use abilities from two other class skill lines at a time. The feature will unlock at the game's max level of 50, and unlocking subclass skill lines will be account-wide across all characters. Some class skill lines will cost double the amount of skill points, though Lambert said he doesn't think that will be a problem for the game's dedicated players.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New Experiments</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473777" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4473777"></a><figcaption>A massive magical barrier, the Writhing Wall, divides the new Solstice zone in half.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4473777-esosolsticewrithingwall.jpg"></figure><p>Aside from subclassing, ZeniMax Online is experimenting in other ways as well. The new Solstice zone will be divided in half by a massive magical barrier called the Writhing Wall, an obstacle that will see players later in the summer participate in a server-wide event that will be the first of its kind in ESO. Players on each server will need to come together to gather resources, defend the island from the Worm Cult, and eventually breach the wall, in the process unlocking the second half of the zone. From how it was described, it sounds similar to something like vanilla World of Warcraft's iconic Gates of Ahn'Qiraj event, where players contributed to a war effort in order to unlock the gates and access two new raids. Lambert said breaching the wall will be a one-time event per server but that there will be ways to experience most of the event for those who miss out.</p><p dir="ltr">"The goal will be to work together with fellow players to breach the wall from the West and gain access to the Eastern half of Solstice," Lambert said. "Your mega-server's collective effort and activity is really going to dictate how fast that server will progress through the phases, which ultimately means players are going to experience the epic final encounter and outcome of the event at different times."</p><p dir="ltr">One major experiment ZeniMax Online has already conducted is the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-onlines-longest-running-issue-is-the-target-of-a-new-play-test-but-its-just-a-first-step/1100-6530226/">Cyrodiil Champions test</a>, which was briefly mentioned during the ESO Direct. It's the studio's answer to performance problems that have long plagued the game's large-scale PvP mode and something that Firor specifically called out as needing to be addressed in his end-of-year blog post. The test, which ran March 24-31, vastly simplified abilities and stats for all players in Cyrodiil in the name of significantly improving performance. In the Q&amp;A, Firor said the test was a huge success and surpassed its goal of being able to support the number of players in Cyrodiil seen shortly after the game's launch in 2014.</p><p dir="ltr">"It couldn't have gone much better," Firor said. "It was beyond-our-wildest-dreams successful."</p><p dir="ltr">Lambert said the next step is to dig through the "mountains of data" from the test. Then, the team will begin to add more changes like additional skill lines and stats before running more tests, slowly working towards turning Cyrodiil Champions into a full-fledged feature.</p><p dir="ltr">ZeniMax Online is also putting an emphasis on catering to new and returning players. As spotlighted in the ESO Direct, updates have already been made to the game's tutorial and starter zones, and the team will continue to look at making the returning player experience better with a "Welcome Back" system set to debut this summer. Kath declined to go into detail on what such a system would entail during the Q&amp;A but said it wasn't a "one-size-fits-all" approach and that it would be a "quest-based, reward-driven experience."</p><p dir="ltr">ESO celebrated its 10-year anniversary last year, and Firor said the game will continue to evolve in the years to come, now with a new format that will allow the team to improve aspects of the game it couldn't find time for on its old yearly chapter schedule.</p><p dir="ltr">"We just didn't have time to do all those little things," Firor said. "This lets us open the development schedule and do lots of cool little things as well as continue to work on content."</p>
