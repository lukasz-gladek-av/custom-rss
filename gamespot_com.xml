                <p>While it might be tempting to immediately load up Road to Glory or Dynasty when you first download <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, going to the settings menu is the best decision you can make. This allows you to customize every gameplay option in the game and learn about some of the new features that EA has added this year. One of the most important sections of the settings menu in College Football 26 is called "Passing Mechanics," and you'll want to ensure you pick the right options here.</p><p>These settings determine nearly everything about how passing works in CFB 26. However, some of the settings can be a little confusing, so we're going to break down the best Passing Mechanics to use.</p><h2>Best Passing Mechanics in College Football 26</h2><p>To get to the Passing Mechanics settings, all you have to do is load up the main menu of CFB 26 and look at the tab bar at the top of the screen. Here, you'll see the "Settings" tab near the end of the list. Scroll to Settings and then select "Gameplay Settings." In the Settings menu, scroll down in the "Game Options" tab until you reach Passing Mechanics.</p><p>As you'll see, there are a few different passing settings to tinker with, with the most important being "Passing Type." This setting can completely change how passing works in CFB 26, so you'll want to understand which one you're picking.</p><p>If you want a rundown of the best Passing Mechanics settings to select, take a look below:</p><ul><li><strong>Passing Type</strong>: Placement &amp; Accuracy</li><li><strong>Passing Slowdown</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Pass Lead Increase</strong>: Small</li><li><strong>Reticle Speed</strong>: 12-14</li><li><strong>Reticle Visibility</strong>: User Only</li><li><strong>Meter Visibility</strong>: User Only</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022"></a><figcaption>The Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg"></figure><p>For starters, the <strong>Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to be the best overall Passing Type</strong> you can use in CFB 26. The other options are: Placement, Classic Passing, and Revamped Passing. By default, you'll have Revamped Passing selected, which is a new spin on Classic Passing that allows for more control over the arc of passes. If you have an accurate quarterback, you can more accurately place balls where a receiver needs them to be to make a catch.</p><p>While you can stick with the shiny new Revamped Passing setting, Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to give you the most precision when it comes to throwing the ball. This adds a timing element to passing that allows you to make perfectly accurate passes on bullet passes. You'll also see some visual aids on screen that make it simpler to control a ball's placement and power. Placement &amp; Accuracy makes it easy to throw every kind of pass in CFB 26 as long as you understand how to use it correctly. If you want a new experience compared to CFB 25, though, you can stick with Revamped Passing and learn the new form of passing that EA's introduced.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Passing Slowdown should always remain off</strong>, as there's no real need to have a slowdown during a pass. You'll also want <strong>Pass Lead Increase set to "small."</strong> What this does is give you a smaller window to lead receivers, which is what you want. You don't want to lead receivers too much when throwing a pass, as this can result in the ball getting outside their catch radius. If that happens, the pass will either fall incomplete or head the other way in a defender's hands.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Reticle Speed option</strong> is a personal preference: We found the <strong>12-14 range to be a sweet spot</strong>. However, if you want the reticle to move slower or faster, you can adjust it accordingly. The last two settings, <strong>Reticle Visibility</strong> and <strong>Meter Visibility</strong>, don't matter much; you can just leave them set to User Only.</p><p>That does it for the Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26. There's not much to them, but subtle changes can have a massive impact on your gameplay.

                <p>Sony shed more light on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-drops-predecessors-samurai-combat-to-make-atsu-a-walking-arsenal/1100-6533101/" data-ref-id="1100-6533101">its State of Play</a> earlier this week. While the focus of the event was primarily on the gameplay and story, there's something special coming for fans of the game. Now, Sony has unveiled the first look at the Ghost of Yotei Limited Edition PlayStation 5 bundles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpy0vfXXnd8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tpy0vfXXnd8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two options for fans: Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and Ghost of Yotei Black Limited Edition Bundle. The Black model will be exclusively available through PlayStation's official store, while the Gold model will be sold everywhere else. Both bundles include a disc drive, a matching DualSense controller, and a digital copy of Ghost of Yoeti with all preorder bonuses.</p><p>The dev team at Sucker Punch designed both limited editions, and noted that the Gold bundle was inspired by the Japanese art form known as kintsugi, which is used to repair broken objects with gold and lacquer. The Black bundle's look was taken from another Japanese art form called Sumi-e, which puts black ink on paintings.</p><p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," noted Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connell. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. The towering Mount Yotei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs."</p><p>Fans who already have a PS5 slim or PS5 Pro will be able to purchase Ghost of Yotei Gold Limited Edition console covers through PlayStation's store. The designs for the DualSense controller will also be available as a separate purchase.</p><p>Both of the limited editions, the console covers, and the controller designs will debut alongside Ghost of Yotei on October 2.</p>
