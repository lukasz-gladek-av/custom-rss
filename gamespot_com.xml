                <p>A lawsuit filed against Bungie alleging the developer used copyrighted ideas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> just got more complicated, as a federal judge has rejected Bungie's attempt to have the case dismissed and ruled that evidence submitted by Bungie in the form of fan-made YouTube videos and wiki pages aren't acceptable.</p><p dir="ltr">The lawsuit filed by author Matthew Kelsey Martineau in late 2024 accuses Bungie of allegedly copying various ideas from their work, including Destiny 2's Red Legion faction and other elements like a giant celestial object hovering over Earth.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie sought to have the case dismissed but has run into a strange problem. Many of the ideas Martineau cited as being accused of copyright, specifically Destiny 2's original Red War campaign and its Curse of Osiris campaign, haven't been playable for years. They've been removed from Destiny 2 as part of Bungie's "vaulting" process that sees the developer occasionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-vault-of-glass-is-returning-but-old-cont/1100-6478197/" data-ref-id="1100-6478197">remove older content</a> from the game. That led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-lawsuit-had-to-cite-destiny-2-fan-videos-because-in-game-content-no-longer-exists/1100-6529709/" data-ref-id="1100-6529709">Bungie including YouTube lore videos in its motion to dismiss the case</a> (like a one a 10-hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzBmOeYmN_M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Complete Story of Destiny" video</a> from YouTuber My Name is Byf) as well as wiki pages from <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destinypedia</a> in order to show the differences between Destiny 2 and Martineau's work.</p><p dir="ltr">In a declaration included as part of Bungie's attempt to dismiss the case, Destiny 2 game director Tyson Green explained that the Red War and Curse of Osiris campaigns "can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework," hence the studio's use of YouTube videos and wiki pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a result, Bungie cannot feasibly provide the Court with the original Destiny 2 game as it existed in 2017, including the accused 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns, in any operable or reviewable form," Green said. "Nor will Bungie be able to produce the accused campaigns in operable or reviewable form if this matter proceeds to formal discovery."</p><p dir="ltr">That is, however, what's happening. The judge overseeing the case said there is sufficient evidence to proceed with the copyright infringement case and that it will not consider YouTube videos and wiki pages as acceptable on Bungie's part, as they originate from a third-party and their "authenticity" has not been established. The judge also stated that the cases Bungie cited in its motion to dismiss are not applicable to this specific case, and that the case "would require a much more complicated side-by-side analysis than those conducted in the caselaw cited by Defendant."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie will reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-reveal-announced-for-next-month/1100-6530898/" data-ref-id="1100-6530898">Destiny 2's next expansion, The Edge of Fate</a>, during an upcoming livestream on May 6. Meanwhile, Bungie's new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, recently held a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-update-allows-players-to-talk-about-the-game/1100-6530975/" data-ref-id="1100-6530975">closed Alpha test</a> and is slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/" data-ref-id="1100-6530810">release on September 23</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There might be a major shakeup to how limited-time modes work with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Call of Duty 2025</a> (which is still unannounced). A new report states that only players who have purchased a battle pass for the FPS will have access to modes tied <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-squid-game-event-includes-red-light-green-light-operator-bundles-and-rewards/2900-6100/#1">to special events, like the Squid Game collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC9Qz9edHJyjR5XCMy5slTzprus4SFSrq3CtSqnkEYc/edit?tab=t.0" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty insider "The Ghost of Hope"</a> wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that Activision is looking to "have more seasonal LTMs," but they will be locked behind the battle pass. Currently, all Call of Duty players have access to these events and modes, though people can buy a premium track pass to earn items and skins if they want. Apparently, this report states those premium tracks wouldn't exist starting with Call of Duty 2025. Instead, those rewards would be mixed into the battle pass.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: Activision/Treyarch are currently planning to make changes to the Battle Pass with the release of Black Ops 7 (2025). </p><p>Black Ops 7 will reportedly have more seasonal LTM’s and some of them would be considered “higher value” with unique rewards and different game… <a href="https://t.co/Kw61ia4XMu" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Kw61ia4XMu</a></p></div>  — Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">That would mean the supposed value of a battle pass would increase, but for people who don't pay, their experience would seemingly decrease since they can't play special events.

This campaign is rumored to have four-player co-op and an open-world map. In addition, the leak noted Treyarch is behind the next installment of the blockbuster FPS franchise. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">Reports of a Black Ops 2 sequel first surfaced</a> back in late 2023.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, Warzone saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-just-hit-a-2025-record-on-steam-following-verdansks-return-to-warzone/1100-6530610/">the return of Verdansk, propelling Call of Duty to see a record of concurrent players on Steam</a> for this year so far. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 3 Reloaded</a> just started to kick off May.

                <p>A Minecraft Movie continues to soar at the box office, climbing above $870 million after about a month in theaters. This weekend, it faced new competition from Marvel's Thunderbolts* movie, and here's how the two films compared for their opening weekends in the US and globally.</p><p>Thunderbolts* made $76 million in the US for its opening weekend from May 2-4.  For comparison, A Minecraft Movie debuted on April 4 and made $162.7 million worldwide over its first weekend in the US alone. This past weekend was A Minecraft Movie's fifth weekend in theaters, and it made $13.7 million in the US. Movie theaters held "block party" screenings of the movie this weekend, during which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-getting-a-theatrical-block-party-edition-inviting-viewers-to-basically-go-wild/1100-6531180/" data-ref-id="1100-6531180">attendees were encouraged to go wild.</a></p><p>Thunderbolts* made $162.1 million worldwide for its opening weekend, compared to $301 million for A Minecraft Movie.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thunderbolts-box-office-solid-opening-1236206794/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, $76 million in the US for Thunderbolts* was "slightly ahead" of expectations, with the report noting that Thunderbolts* featuring relatively lesser-known characters might have factored in to the movie's performance so far.</p><p>Thunderbolts* reportedly had a production budget of $180 million, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/a-minecraft-movie-box-office.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million for A Minecraft Movie.</a></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time</a>, only trailing The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.3 billion). Another video game movie is currently in theaters, too, as Sony's Until Dawn movie has now earned <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt30955489/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$34.8 million worldwide</a> against a reported $15 million budget.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-sounds-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6530854/" data-ref-id="1100-6530854">close to announcing A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>
