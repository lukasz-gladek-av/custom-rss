                <p>In June, Skybound Entertainment and its new development studio Quarter Up announced Invincible Vs., a 3v3 tag-based fighting game starring the cast of the popular superhero series. Today at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, the two companies revealed that Invincible Vs. will launch on April 30, 2026, and its roster will include an all-new original superhero--designed by the series's co-creators--named Ella Mental.</p><p dir="ltr">Ella Mental can control earth, fire, wind, and water, and she uses all four elements in her offense. She can summon boulders to block enemy attacks, shoot fiery projectiles, and even mix elements together--her Level 1 super creates a waterspout that launches the opponent into the air, then scores multiple hits. Ella Mental will be voiced by rapper and recording artist Tierra Whack.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzPTZAj014U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rzPTZAj014U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Skybound and Quarter Up also confirmed that the initial roster for Invincible Vs. will include 18 characters. With the reveal of Ella Mental, 11 of those 18 have been announced:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Invincible (Mark Grayson)</li><li dir="ltr">Omni-Man</li><li dir="ltr">Atom Eve</li><li dir="ltr">Bulletproof</li><li dir="ltr">Rex Splode</li><li dir="ltr">Thula</li><li dir="ltr">Robot</li><li dir="ltr">Monster Girl</li><li dir="ltr">Cecil Stedman</li><li dir="ltr">Battle Beast</li><li dir="ltr">Ella Mental (original creation)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Development studio Quarter Up is made up of multiple developers from Double Helix, the studio behind the Killer Instinct reboot in 2013. Among the Double Helix veterans is Mike Willette, founder of Quarter Up, who KI fans will recognize as the voice behind the famous "C-C-C-C-Combo breaker!" quote.</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible Vs. is set to launch on April 30 for Xbox Series, X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.
