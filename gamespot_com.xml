                <p>For the second year in a row, it's looking like an official Lego tabletop game is going to be one of the most popular board/card games during the holiday season. Last year it was <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monkey Palace</a></strong>, a fun strategy board game for up to four players. This year it's <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Brick Like This</a></strong>, a collaborative party game for up to eight players. Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game--not to be confused with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO%C2%AE-Party-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FCGVMVRD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Party</a>, the video game--is available now for only $20 at Amazon and other major retailers. </p><p>Brick Like This and Monkey Palace were designed by Dotted Games, a studio under the Asmodee umbrella dedicated to Lego board games. Based on the sustained success of Monkey Palace and how well Brick Like This appears to be performing out of gate, it seems likely we'll be talking about Dotted Games' third Lego board game this time next year.</p><div title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4827" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Brick Like This: A Lego Party Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party\/dp\/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Brick-Like-This-Official-Party/dp/B0DX26KGCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Brick Like This!

It's a fast-paced game that's dynamically designed to offer a different experience each time you play.</p><p>Players are split into teams of two in a race to see who can build miniature Lego models the fastest. One player builds the model based on instructions communicated by their partner. There are 92 shape cards and 48 total Lego pieces. Models have a minimum of five bricks and a maximum of eight bricks. You're awarded more points by opting for models with more pieces--though the instructor won't know what the model actually looks like until they flip the card over.</p><p>In addition to the regular shape cards, there are 20 challenge cards that introduce restrictions for builders and instructors, such as building the model with your eyes closed or with one hand and limiting the types of hints you can provide as the instructor.</p><p>When a team completes the model, they flip the hourglass, which starts a 30-second countdown to the end of the round. After six rounds, teams tally their scores and declare a winner. Each game takes around 15 minutes total.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4829" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Lego] Monkey Palace Board Game" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZVPLJFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$39.25 (was $42)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>If you haven't played the studio's debut game Monkey Palace, I'd highly recommend for family game nights if you like strategy and puzzle games. </p><p>Two to four players take turns building staircases and decorating the makeshift palace.

There's more "traditional" Lego building involved with this one, as it comes with 231 Lego pieces and an official Lego baseplate. </p><p>Each game takes around 45 minutes, and no two games will be the same. Adding to the replay value is the inclusion of two double-sided maps, which are placed on the baseplate to alter the starting foundation.

It's unknown whether this includes PS4 and Xbox One, but the price point is $40, according to the report. That's the same entry cost that EA charged last year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-might-finally-get-a-sims-game-but-maybe-not-the-one-you-expect/1100-6526093/">when MySims Cozy Bundle hit Switch</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCTB6JlwQ-k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SCTB6JlwQ-k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mysims-review/1900-6178929/">MySims</a> originally debuted on Wii and Nintendo DS in 2007.

There is no planned offline mode, so the game will be unplayable after then.
