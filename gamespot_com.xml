                <p>Fallout fans have been understandably curious about the future of the franchise, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> isn't expected to arrive before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, and Bethesda hasn't been very forthcoming about when that game is coming either. For now, Bethesda's Todd Howard is keeping the company's plans close to his vest, but he has indicated there's more happening with Fallout than any other Bethesda property at the moment.</p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>Howard also indicated that the success of Prime Video's Fallout TV series hasn't altered those plans or caused Bethesda to move up its timetable.</p><p>"We had a plan for the games we were going to make," said Howard. "The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world."</p><p>The show and the game world recently intersected in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-adds-new-map-region-and-walton-goggins-the-ghoul/1100-6536654/" data-ref-id="1100-6536654">Fallout 76's Burning Springs update</a>, which added Walton Goggins' The Ghoul as an important character. Howard praised the new update, but refused to directly answer questions about the rumored remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-3/" data-ref-id="5000-19700">Fallout 3</a>. However, he did reiterate how pleased he was with the release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster, and hinted that future titles like that may also be given shadow drops.</p><p>Earlier this fall, Bethesda released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, but the rollout has been marred by numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash. Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">released an update</a> last month to deal with some of those problems, with a second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well.</p><p>Fallout Season 2 will premiere on Prime Video on December 17. In the meantime, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-fallout-pip-boy-controller-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6536863/" data-ref-id="1100-6536863">Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox Wireless Controller is now available for preorders</a>.</p>

                <p>Developer Aspyr Media announced that Deus Ex Remastered has been delayed (seemingly indefinitely) so the team can "deliver the best possible experience."</p><p>Aspyr <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">delivered the news on X</a>, posting that, alongside a commitment to delivering the best possible experience, the team wants to meet the expectations of its fanbase.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>  — Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As such, the game has been pushed back from its initial February 5, 2026 release date. More updates will be shared "when the time comes," Aspyr said. By delaying the game, <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170713253564497" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio is also refunding all preorders</a> while thanking fans for their continued patience and support.</p><p>Deus Ex Remastered was revealed during Sony's September 24 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7073/" data-ref-id="2900-7073">State of Play livestream</a>. The trailer showed off visual "enhancements," with associate brand manager Matthew Ray <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explaining on the PlayStation Blog</a> that the remaster would introduce overhauled controls, haptic feedback with the DualSense controller, updated lighting, improved shadows, increased particle effects, and enhanced textures.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game was criticized following its reveal. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1RdKezTYNk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comments of the official trailer</a> on PlayStation's YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/everyone-thinks-the-deus-ex-remaster-looks-awful-and-theyre-right-they-really-turned-those-1999-graphics-into-2003-graphics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">netizens decried the game's new visuals</a>. Others couldn't believe this was coming when no one asked for it. Some simply said it was a shame. Up and down the comments, people were confounded by the supposed visual improvements Aspyr touted.</p><p>This feedback is likely why Aspyr has delayed the game. Now, Deus Ex Remastered doesn't have a firm release date.</p>
