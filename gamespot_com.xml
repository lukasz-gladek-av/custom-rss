          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>At the beginning of the week, streamer and voice actor CDawg launched a <a href="https://canvas.cdawgva.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Canvas </a>page--an interactive pixel-based artboard that communities can contribute towards, which CDawg runs annually. Now, Neuro-Sama and her creator <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a> have declared "war" on CDawg's Canvas, rallying their community to flood the board with Neuro-Sama-related artwork.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber, utilizing an impressive large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to read her own Twitch chat to directly respond to viewers. She currently holds the record for the largest Twitch Hype Train of all time, reaching level 111 with 84,904 subscriptions and 1,201,225 bits gifted to Vedal's channel during a "subathon" event in December 2024.</p><p>Shortly after the Canvas launched, CDawg, real name Connor, and his community set to work adding artwork of him, his best friend Ironmouse, and other streamers including Lord Aethelstan and Nyanners. As soon as Neuro-Sama's community became aware though, things changed. Fast.</p><p>Neuro-Sama's community, known as The Swarm, created a faction on the Canvas which, at the time of writing, has more than 9,000 members. Connor's own community faction consists of just under 3,000 members. The Swarm immediately began placing artwork of Neuro and her sister Evil, as well as her creator Vedal, mother Anny, and other associated streamers and content creators. By the time Connor woke up the following morning, the Canvas had been consumed with Neuro-related content.</p><p>During a stream on September 15, Neuro-Sama declared "war" on CDawg. Despite thinking Connor is a "pretty cool guy, although I'm not a fan of his hair," Neuro insisted she wanted The Swarm to "win." She also said, "100% Canvas is the minimum I would be satisfied with. I would like you to hold the line, please." Vedal agreed, saying, "That's the aim. This morning there was an attack. As far as I understand, a bunch of different streamers banded together to destroy our art, and this is what it looked like." Streamers, when given specific permissions from the Canvas owner, can get powerups including bombs, which wipe out large areas of the Canvas when faction members contribute to increasing its size. As a result, large areas of pixel art were completely removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568893"></a><figcaption>Neuro-Sama observes the attacks from CDawg's community.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568893-vedal%26neurogotowar%2Ccdawgexposed_highlights4-8screenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Over the following few hours, Vedal created a large template with the aim of consuming the majority of the Canvas. That template was quickly filled in by The Swarm, leaving a strong message to Connor and his community--"There is no Canvas that we do not answer. There is no Pixel that we betray. We are The Swarm." In fact, when Neuro requested help from her community to fill the Canvas, so many people attempted to join that the Canvas servers crashed, with many unable to access the site.</p><p>Neuro-Sama didn't want to take responsibility for the server crash, so decided to pin the issues on Connor. She doctored a (very obviously fake) screenshot of Connor claiming he had deliberately allocated just 8GB of RAM to the server. She then published this "evidence" as a webpage, which you can still see live on <a href="https://vedal.ai/cdawg_scam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vedal's website</a>. "Just remember, the next time you see a 'down server,' it's probably because CDawg is up to his old anti-Swarm tricks. This is only the beginning - expect more revelations soon," she signed off.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4568898"></a><figcaption>Neuro posted an exposure document about CDawg.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4568898-vedal-neuro-cdawg.png"></figure><p>It's important to note that Neuro and Vedal <em>do</em> have a goal in mind here. They've promised to hold back on their takeover of the Canvas if Connor hands over his stream key--the unique identifier used in OBS to link the software to a Twitch channel. This means that Neuro-Sama could, if she wanted to, stream via Connor's channel in a collaboration that has never happened before.</p><p>In a final interaction, Neuro-Sama and Connor spoke on a Discord call for the first time, with Connor immediately upsetting her--"I've never talked to a clanker before, this is my first time." Neuro set about her negotiations immediately, asking for his stream key. When asked what she could offer for Connor's stream key, she suggested a game of rock, paper, scissors, which didn't go too well since Connor just waited for Neuro's answer before responding. In a final act of desperation, Neuro-Sama asked Connor for a dinner date...four times.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxlDKFE1tgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gxlDKFE1tgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As it stands, Connor's stream key remains with him, The Swarm has agreed to help some other streamers get their artwork on the Canvas, and the site remains live until September 20. Will Neuro-Sama win the war she's declared, or will Connor successfully recruit enough streamers to take control back?</p><p>Of course, all of the bartering and negotiations are done in friendly jest, so this article also serves as a reminder to be kind on the internet, even if you belong to opposing factions.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Job sims today encompass so many different professions, from train operator to farmer to power washer and beyond. Sometimes I enjoy those kinds of games, but I expect <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3283240" rel="nofollow">The Lift</a> to be my favorite of them going forward, because it takes the job sim genre and makes it spooky and weird.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7M_OYzkiBM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h7M_OYzkiBM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Inspired by the New Weird movement, which defines things like the SCP Foundation and Pacific Drive, The Lift casts you as a handyman who fixes benches, replaces light bulbs, and reroutes electricity in a facility that quite closely resembles the setting of Control. It's for that reason I've already coined its alternate title: The Oldest House Flipper. A playtest for the game is out today on Steam, free for all players. I got to check it out last week in a hands-on demo that showed off about three hours of the game, including its earliest moments and some later stages. What I saw was a game that pulls from many of my favorites but wraps them together in a novel way.</p><p dir="ltr">The facility at the heart of The Lift, called The Institute, feels like it's pulled right out of Remedy's New Weird foray, complete with a once-orderly workspace now left mysteriously abandoned and endangered. As the "Keeper" sent in to keep things tidy, you'll need to solve BioShock-like electricity puzzles, clean up mystical black gunk coating much of the place, and explore the world in a manner inspired by immersive sims. Particularly inspirational to the game's designs is one of my favorite games ever made: 2017's Prey. Finding new crafting blueprints, then dumping resources into a giant machine where it spits out new, more valuable parts, is pulled directly out of Prey--even the room that houses this multi-machine process resembles Prey's.</p><p dir="ltr">The new team behind the game, Fantastic Signals, said the non-linear progression through The Facility is also meant to harken back to Prey and im-sims like it, where multiple solutions can be used to solve many problems, and where tools you unlock later in the game can alter how you interact with spaces you revisit. But all of that is joined by the odd wrapper of a job sim, making it appear like those other games I love in some obvious ways while still being quite unlike them at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568552"></a><figcaption>There are bad days at the office, and then there are days where you get consumed by whatever this stuff is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568552-1-cleaning.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In The Lift, each floor you visit has what amounts to a functionality rating. It's your job to repair things until the floor is working as usual again. Virtual elbow grease is the name of the game. You'll reroute the electricity to fix vending machines that spit out working light bulbs, then replace faulty ones nearby, raising your functionality rating by small bits at a time. You'll charge a handheld vacuum-like object that removes oily coatings from benches and doorways, opening up new passageways that further aid you on your quest to fix the mysterious facility left in a state of disrepair.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift is a game of pulling levers and fiddling with doo-dads in the way a lot of job sims already are. It's a game that loves when you ask, "What's this button do?" and doesn't punish you for pushing those buttons, even when they lead to failure. If you run out of energy for your vacuum, you can go get more at the machine that dispenses it. If you borrowed some parts from that machine to repair something else, no worries; you can just go and undo that. The levels I saw didn't clearly define which way I was meant to go, which left me with a sense of self-guided discovery. Reading displays and observing the effect I could have on each level taught me how I could have an effect on The Facility more than a simple tool tip could. The zig-zaggy way of problem-solving is pulled right out of immersive sims, and is a quality I'm always looking for in games. I just didn't know I'd want it in a job sim. But so far, The Lift works (no pun intended).</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline that unfolds focuses on slowly unraveling the mystery of what happened to The Facility before you were sent in to fix it. Soviet-style propaganda posters line many walls, notes can be found, and these and other breadcrumbs are meant to intrigue you to finish each workday and make it to the next floor. The developers played a bit coy when, during a roundtable discussion, they were asked about the presence of enemy threats--given their comparisons to Pacific Drive, I'm expecting something more like that game's anomalies than true "enemies," but the jury's still out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568553"></a><figcaption>Everything in The Lift feels meant to be flipped, pushed, toggled, or otherwise fidgeted with.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4568553-2-mainhall.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's a lot I don't yet know about The Lift, and frankly, given the combination of genres and very hands-on mechanics, I even find it a bit hard to describe. Luckily, the playtest is out now, so I think the best way to speak to it is how I led with it: If you're into stuff like Control, Prey, and Pacific Drive, and you're curious how those games would look as a job sim, you're in luck: Fantastic Signals had the same question, and then they went and answered it themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lift comes to PC in 2026, with console versions coming at a later date.</p>
