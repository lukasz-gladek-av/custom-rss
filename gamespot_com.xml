Announced for Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR headsets, this new game will see players control the merc with a mouth--voiced by actor Neil Patrick Harris--as he takes on classic villains like X-Men villains like Mojo and Lady Deathstrike.</p><p>Developer Twisted Pixel, known for a few other funny games, like 'Splosion Man, announced the game with a trailer that captures a lot of Deadpool's ridiculous banter, as well as a bunch of the flippy-shooty mayhem you'll get up to in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/4Jof1MtYccs?si=p2Jj-77huVQLPq-U" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Watch it right here</a>.</p><p>The game features an all-new, original Deadpool story that finds the quippy hero sucked through a portal to Mojoworld, where he's tasked with traveling across the Marvel universe to take on a bunch of villains. Gameplay combines shooting, stabbing, and parkour, and also looks to let you to leverage Deadpool's regenerative superpowers so you can get blown up and dismembered yourself, if that's what it takes to get the job done.</p><p>Marvel's Deadpool is set to launch later this year.</p><p>This isn't the first time that a VR game based on an iconic comic book character has been announced for Quest headsets, as last year saw the release of the highly acclaimed Batman: Arkham Shadow. The game earned positive reviews for translating the core Arkham experience into VR, as players were able to engage in detective work, stalk enemies, and brawl with them.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-superhero-game-to-look-out-for-in-2024-and-beyond/2900-5051/">several other Marvel games are in development right now</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> looks like an old-school tribute to '90s beat-'em-ups, and the June State of Play livestream ended with a bang as Guilty Gear developer Arc System Works announced it was developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-marvel-fighting-game-is-coming-from-arc-system-works/1100-6532114/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>.</p><p>The 4v4 fighting game features fresh redesigns of classic characters like Captain America and Iron Man, and it's scheduled to be out in 2026.

After escaping from a decade in captivity and the horrific experiments performed on him by the Baron, Crane makes his way to the once-bustling tourist destination in search of vengeance and finds it overrun with zombies.</p><p>Like previous games, the infected people stalking the streets during the day will be the least of your worries, because once the sun sets, the worst of the zombie horde comes out to play. Fortunately, Crane has parkour skills and an off-road vehicle to help him outrun enemies, and when push comes to shove, the zombie DNA in his blood gives him an edge in combat.</p><p>Techland's new trailer showed off Crane's savage side, as he can now tap into his rage-fueled powers to smash through zombies. If brute force isn't enough, Crane can also make use of various melee weapons and firearms to even the odds. Priced at $60 for the standard edition, preorders will unlock the Hero of Harran Bundle. This includes the following DLC:</p><ul><li>Ultimate Survivor Outfit</li><li>Harran Combat Knife</li><li>The Follower Crossbow</li><li>In Jadeâ€™s Memory Pistol</li><li>Castor Woods Patrol</li></ul><p>Dying Light: The Beast is just one of several big reveals from Summer Game Fest 2025, and for more, you can check out our feature on all the announcements from the annual gaming showcase.</p>

Jurassic World Evolution 3 is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on October 21, 2025, and like the games that came before it, players will manage dinosaur species and the park experience for guests.</p><p>Jurassic World Evolution 3 has more than 80 dinosaur species, and players will be able to breed and nurture them "across entire generations." That's right: We're getting baby dinos.</p><p>"Rear them from playful juveniles into awe-inspiring adults, each with distinct female, male, and juvenile variants," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cmEUXCTn8Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6cmEUXCTn8Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of the park-building elements, players can use new terrain-editing tools. In short, Frontier says players can "build and tweak every aspect" of the park to their liking. The game also supports the Frontier Workshop, allowing players to upload and share their creations.</p><p>Dr. Ian Malcolm from the Jurassic Park movie series appears in the game, and he's voiced by actor Jeff Goldblum. He also does the narration in the announcement trailer above.</p><p>The Jurassic World Evolution 3 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> confirms that the game uses generative AI.

                <p>The studio behind Lego Builder's Journey debuted its next game at Summer Game Fest, and it's an adorable co-op adventure starring--you guessed it--a pair of little Lego bricks. The brief trailer showed a blooming friendship between blue and orange 1x1 bricks as they worked together to solve puzzling challenges.</p><p>The game is built around two-player co-op--locally, or you can invite your friends to play for free with a Friend's Pass. Like Builder's Journey, the narrative is delivered without words. The world looks entirely built out of bricks, so you can snap and join your way through obstacles together.</p><p>The art style looks very similar to Builder's Journey, with a similar isometric perspective through some segments. But the two also find themselves floating down-river, navigating highways and trains, and joining themselves with other bricks to carry them. They seem to be making their way towards a rocket through most of the trailer, which ends with them watching it take off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYggKzKdg08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bYggKzKdg08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the announcement, the story centers around friendship, the value of being connected, and "letting your imagination run wild when looking up at the sky." No release window was given.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dotemu's upcoming beat-'em-up, Marvel Cosmic Invasion, has revealed two popular comic book characters for its ever-growing roster. Fans will be able to play as Rocket Raccoon and She-Hulk, easily switching between the two as they shoot and smash their way through hordes of enemies. At least, that's the way it looks via a new trailer showcased during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-cosmic-invasions-she-hulk-and-rocket-raccoon-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/1100-6532207/" data-ref-id="1100-6532207">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> show.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn7FWkzOyq4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xn7FWkzOyq4?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Joining the cast of 15 Marvel characters--alongside the likes of Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, and Storm--She-Hulk and Raccoon will offer their own brand of beatdown when facing Annihilus' forces. And considering Dotemu's work on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/streets-of-rage-4/" data-ref-id="5000-486300">Streets of Rage </a>4, one can only image the creative combos players will be able to come up with when playing as these heroes.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, we didn't get a release date for Marvel Cosmic Invasion. We know that some of Marvel's best are going to wage war with Annihilus as he pulls strings from the Negative Zone. We just don't know when it's all going down. That said, it's apparent that when the "annihilation wave" hits the fan, players will have enough firepower (and in She-Hulk's case, muscle) to win when the game is released on Xbox Series X|S, PS4, PS5, Switch, and PC later this year.</p>
