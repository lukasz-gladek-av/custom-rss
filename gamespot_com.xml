                <p>This week marks the 20th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/half-life-2-review/1900-6113062/" data-ref-id="1900-6113062">Half-Life 2</a>, Valve's seminal first-person shooter and arguably one of the genre's greatest games. To celebrate the occasion, Valve released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/half-life-2-gets-big-20th-anniversary-update-as-new-information-on-episode-3-revealed/1100-6527820/" data-ref-id="1100-6527820">a nearly two-hour documentary</a> on the making of the game, which included the story of how Valve's future was threatened by a lawsuit from its former publisher, Vivendi.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As related by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/a-summer-intern-once-saved-valve-from-a-near-fatal-lawsuit-after-a-publisher-decided-to-go-world-war-3-on-it-and-it-all-hinged-on-one-email/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> and <a href="https://80.lv/articles/valve-steam-the-entire-pc-gaming-industry-were-saved-by-a-single-intern/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>, the story behind the lawsuit begins about one hour into the documentary, and that tale flows in and out of the background of Half-Life 2's development over the next 43 minutes of the movie. At the heart of the lawsuit was Valve's assertion that Vivendi was distributing Counter-Strike to South Korean cyber cafes without permission from Valve itself.</p><p>In response to Valve's lawsuit asserting its rights, Vivendi responded with multiple counter-claims against the former, as well as Valve COO Scott Lynch and co-founder Gabe Newell. The legal battle was such a drain on Valve's resources that the company nearly went bankrupt. Newell also revealed that he was nearly personally bankrupted as well, and he had to put up his house for sale in order to keep fighting.</p><p>A deal with another publisher gave Valve some much-needed breathing room. But the turning point in the case came when Vivendi handed over millions of pages of emails during the discovery phase, which were all in Korean. As it happened, Valve had a summer intern--a native Korean speaker who is only mentioned by his first name, Andrew--who found the proverbial smoking gun in all of those messages. In an exchange between two of Vivendi's vice presidents, one of them mentioned that he had "destroyed those Valve documents like you asked."</p><p>"I did a lot of lawsuits for a long time," recalled Valve general counsel Karl Quackenbush. "I never saw anything like that. Never. Maybe there was document destruction that couldn't be proved, but that was like, 'We're talking about it in writing.' I'd never seen that before. At that point, Judge Zilly said, 'All matters of fact are now according to Valve. You don't get to contest any of those. Now we're just discussing the [settlement], how much you're gonna have to pay and what the damages are.'"</p><p>Valve emerged from that lawsuit with a settlement that returned its IP from Vivendi and secured its future as a publisher and as a distributer for other publishers through Steam. That bright future might never have happened without Andrew. But the documentary never mentions whether Andrew was offered a job with Valve, which would have been a fitting reward for saving the company.</p>

                <p>The latest update for the PlayStation Portal is introducing a highly requested feature for the handheld remote play device: cloud streaming without using a home console. The feature launches in beta this week, allowing PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers to stream select PS Plus games directly from the cloud.</p><p>The addition of cloud streaming is set to be a major upgrade for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-playstation-portal-just-isnt-good-enough/1100-6519416/" data-ref-id="1100-6519416">handheld PlayStation device</a>, which currently uses a remote-play system requiring a strong internet connection from both the Portal and the PS5 it's playing off. With cloud streaming, PS Plus Premium subscribers will be able to use the Portal to stream PS5 games, even without a PS5 console, similarly to how Xbox Cloud Gaming works for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. </p>

<p>The beta includes support for select PS5 games in the PS Plus game catalog, including Dave the Diver, Ghost of Tsushima, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, among others. The beta doesn't currently allow for streaming games that have been purchased off the PS Store.</p><p>Players will be able to stream up to 1080p/60fps, with a 1080p stream requiring minimum 13 Mbps, and 720p requiring at least 7 Mbps. The cloud streaming beta is opt-in, and interested players with an active PS Plus Premium subscription can enable it under "Cloud Streaming (Beta)" in the setting menu of their Portal device.</p><p>"PS Portal was an ambitious product for us, and we have been delighted by the positive response from our fans and to see that our vision has resonated with the community," Sony said in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> post about the new update.

                <p>Earlier this year, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">the revival of the Backyard Sports franchise</a>, which began with a remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/backyard-baseball-97-review-hit-parade/1900-6418299/" data-ref-id="1900-6418299">Backyard Baseball '97</a> in October. While there are more remasters are on the way, Playground and Mega Cat have revealed that a brand-new Backyard Sports game is now in development, too.</p><p>Additional details about the new Backyard Sports game--or even which sport will be in the spotlight--weren't disclosed. Playground noted in a press release that Mega Cat will develop the title, which will include "all the original characters alongside a few new additions." The announcement also stated that it will have "the comedy, diversity, accessibility, and fun that made the original titles timeless classics." It's unclear if the new title will only be on PC or if the game will be available on consoles as well.</p><p>The new Backyard Sports game doesn't currently have a release date, but the next retro remaster is arriving soon. Backyard Soccer '98 is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170410/Backyard_Soccer_98/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam's wishlist</a>, and it will be launching on November 27. The game will feature six-on-six matches between the Backyard Sports kids, with a total of eight kids on each team. Players have the option of choosing pick-up games or League Play, which allows the assembled team to compete in division play before going on to the Astonishingly Shiny Cup of All Cups Tournament.</p><p>Backyard Soccer '98's return <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">was announced in October</a> alongside four other upcoming remasters from the history of the franchise. The remaining titles include Backyard Football '99, Backyard Basketball '01, Backyard Baseball '01, and Backyard Hockey '02. Although none of those games currently have release dates, their wishlist pages are active on Steam.</p>
