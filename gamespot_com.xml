                <p>The developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/" data-ref-id="5000-514265">Skate</a> seem to get that skating is a style thing as much it is a lifestyle. The board itself doesn't make the skater cool, but the bevy of customization options that'll be present at Skate's early access launch certainly will.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest update</a> from its developers, customization will be a crucial part of the experience, and it's the first thing players will do upon booting up the game. At that point, players will be able to fine tune many aspects of their avatar, such as their body shape, height, as well as tons of aspects of their face, and more.</p><p>The way that your characters moves when they're off the board--a setting that the developers are calling Locomotion--is also customizable, and you can even select gestures, which can be done both on-and-off-board.</p><p>Naturally, players will also get to trick out their clothes and boards as well, and completing challenges and missions throughout the game will net them a currency called Rip Chips. This currency is used to buy Skate's equivalent of loot boxes and increase what the team is calling a Rip Score, which sounds like an in-game leveling system. Raising your Rip Score will be a surefire way to keep unlocking more customization options, such as helmets, skirts, and shoes for the player, as well as trucks, stickers, and grip tape for your deck.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295" data-ratio="0.56309523809524" data-width="840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550295"></a><figcaption>A skater's gotta grind. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550295-skategrind.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550297,1300-4550298,1300-4550299,1300-4550300,1300-4550301" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550297-skateemote.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550298-skategrabster.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550299-skatemenu.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550300-skatemusic.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4550301-skatemusicplayer.jpg"></figure><p>Speaking of, considering Skate will be free-to-play, it will also offer players the chance to score cosmetics via microtransactions. The Skate Shop will accept the game's premium currency, called San Van Bucks, and will be used for direct purchases, not loot boxes that leave things to chance. Alongside the shop, seasons, which are expected to run around three months at a time, and the Skate Pass should also be considered avenues by which the player can get even more cosmetics.</p><p>At the end of the update, the developers behind Skate acknowledge the possibility of sharing custom gear created by other players considering the new game's emphasis on user-generated content. Despite this, it doesn't outright confirm that it will be in the game, at least at launch, saying that when it has "something concrete to share, like a timeline, we'll make sure to let you know."</p><p>Suffice to say, there will be lots of ways to trick yourself and your board out when Skate launches and beyond. In the meantime, its most recent playtest has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-reboot-has-over-1-million-sign-ups-for-latest-playtest/1100-6533473/" data-ref-id="1100-6533473">surpassed a million signups</a>, representing an early and promising milestone for the game ahead of its release into early access later this summer. Skate will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC, with mobile versions planned to come to iOS and Android at a later time.</p>

                <p>The second weekend of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> is now in full swing, and Battlefield Studios isn't wasting time when it comes to making some adjustments to the game's Rush mode.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced by the official <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms account on X</a>, MCOM timers on Rush have been reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to "better balance between attacking and defending players." Additionally, respawn timers have been adjusted on both Rush and Breakthrough so that defender respawns are now fixed at 12 seconds, having previously been between 6-12 seconds. One other change on Breakthrough makes it so fewer players are needed on an objective in order to speed up the capture time.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush<br>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture.

Combined with the smaller sizes of the maps featured in the Battlefield 6 beta, and this iteration of Rush doesn't seem to have won over many fans, with one longtime <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield content creator</a> stating he would rather see the mode removed until it's "been properly worked on," citing poor map balance.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may alleviate some of the issues fans have had with Rush in Battlefield 6, something that one of the game's producers said the full game will have. Battlefield 6 will launch with a total of nine maps, four of which are currently playable in the second open beta weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the Rush complaints and some issues revolving around its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enabling-secure-boot-for-battlefield-6-is-turning-into-a-nightmare-for-some/1100-6533811/" data-ref-id="1100-6533811">Secure Boot requirement on PC</a>, Battlefield 6's beta has already been a big success, surpassing both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a> and that of previous Battlefield games on Steam.
