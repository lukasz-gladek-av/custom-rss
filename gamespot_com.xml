                <p>Sony has confirmed that its first State of Play livestream for 2025 will kick off on <strong>February 12 </strong>at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. As usual, you'll be able to watch it on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels.</p><p>This looks like it'll be a pretty big livestream, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony says</a> the event will run for at least 40 minutes and will show "a creative and unique selection of exciting games" from various studios around the world.</p><p>So what else can you expect from the show? Sony is keeping details on it under wraps, but the company does have some big games in development currently. The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> last year, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima sequel--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost of Yotei</a>--is scheduled to release later this year, and it'll be interesting to see if the live-service heist-'em-up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fairgame/" data-ref-id="5000-589427">FairGame$</a> makes an appearance after a long period of radio silence.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> director Hideo Kojima has also been sharing a few teases for a new trailer on his social media accounts, so we could get a new look at the post-apocalyptic courier game. Beyond that, there has also been quite a bit of speculation regarding From Software's Bloodborne, as the 10th anniversary of the game is fast approaching.</p><p>Additionally, numerous third-party games are coming out this year from notable studios. February 2025 still has big releases like Monster Hunter Wilds and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, while March turns up the heat with Assassin's Creed Shadows, Atomfall, and Killing Floor 3.</p>
