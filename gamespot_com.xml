                <p>BlizzCon will be back for 2026, Blizzard has announced, in the process confirming the convention will not happen this year. The developer's (usually) annual fan expo will return to the Anaheim Convention Center in September 2026 after having taken two years off.</p><p dir="ltr">Whereas the vast majority of BlizzCons have happened in November, BlizzCon 2026 will instead happen two months earlier on September 12-13. In a press release announcing the date, Blizzard did not give more details or an explanation as to why the event is happening several months earlier than usual, nor why a 2025 event isn't happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've come a long way since our first event in 2005," Blizzard said in a press release. "Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It's important that we put on an event worthy of our community."</p><p dir="ltr">Many BlizzCon staples, like the announcement-heavy opening ceremony, in-depth panels about what's next for Blizzard's games, competitive tournaments, and more will be a part of the 2026 expo, Blizzard confirmed, additionally stating it aims to "elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not announced when tickets will go on sale but said to sign up on the official BlizzCon website to receive updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/" data-ref-id="1100-6522953">Blizzard said it decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> It went on to say it was a decision it didn't make lightly as "BlizzCon remains a very special event for all of us, and we know many of you look forward to it." Blizzard at the time said it was "excited as ever" to bring back BlizzCon in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">While there was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/" data-ref-id="1100-6515587">BlizzCon 2023</a>, there wasn't one in 2022, with Blizzard instead opting for a digital-only presentation. Assuming BlizzCon 2026 does happen as planned, that will mean there will have only been two in-person BlizzCon events in the preceding five years.</p><p dir="ltr">In lieu of making major announcements at BlizzCon, Blizzard in 2024 instead revealed what's next for the Warcraft franchise during a 30th anniversary livestream (including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing in World of Warcraft</a>) and announced new details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Diablo 4's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred, as part of Summer Game Fest</a> and Gamescom 2024. Blizzard more recently outlined the year ahead for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">Overwatch 2, revealing its ambitious new Stadium game mode</a>.</p>

The first game was a post-apocalyptic courier service adventure where you <em>really</em> didn't want to be caught out in the rain and it was anchored by the digital performances of Hollywood stars such as Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen.</p><p>In December 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/">Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards</a>. After years of teasing, it's full steam ahead for the sequel when it arrives in June, but even when it's so close to the finish line, we still have many questions we're hoping to have answered in Death Stranding 2.

Sony was heavily involved in the development of the first game--and assisted Kojima Productions in completing the reveal trailer through its PlayStation Studios Visual Arts group--but given the company's recent approach to porting more of its console-exclusives to PC in the years since Death Stranding launched, it's highly likely that Death Stranding 2 will make its way to that platform eventually.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Kojima is keeping the Death Stranding 2 story under wraps for now, but he has revealed a few details about the game since its official debut, while the first trailer has also hinted at a new calamity on the horizon as the unstoppable Death Stranding continues. The story for Death Stranding 2 that Kojima originally had in mind was thrown out after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with Kojima remarking that he restarted from square one. "I had the story written before the pandemic. But after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole story from scratch," Kojima said at the Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"Should we have connected" is the main crux of the story, as following Sam's journey to help establish the United Cities of America, the world has changed. Deliveries are now automated, a dangerous new cult seems to have emerged, and Higgs Monoghan has somehow managed to escape the Beach after he was stranded on it toward the end of the first game. Throw in a hulking samurai outfitted in red armor, kaiju-sized tar-monsters, and new locales, and Death Stranding 2 looks like it'll be greatly expanding on the ideas of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA," the official plot synopsis from Kojima Productions reads. "Sam--with companions by his side--sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles, and a haunting question: should we have connected?"</p><p dir="ltr">If you sift through the reveal trailer, there's a whole bunch of fascinating threads to explore, ranging from the state of the world after more connections had been made, the return of Fragile, who is in a much healthier state now, and possibly a multiverse of variants to deal with. For a deeper dive, you can check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/death-stranding-2-ultimate-trailer-breakdown-and-wild-speculations/2300-6460229/"> Death Stranding 2 trailer breakdown</a> for some wild speculation.

This time, Reedus will be joined by a few new faces as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/"> Elle Fanning</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-game-features-deadpool-2-actress/1100-6508796/"> Shioli Kutsuna</a> are in the cast. Reedus once again plays Sam Porter Bridges, and he's joined by Lea Seydoux (Fragile) and Troy Baker (Higgs Monaghan), two characters from the first Death Stranding.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new actors include Mad Max director George Miller as Tarman, the captain of the DHV Magellan and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/"> Fatih Akin as Dollman</a>, one of the more interesting additions to the series. True to his name, Dollman is a living puppet who'll join Sam on his journey, and who isn't afraid to pick a fight with people like Higgs. Speaking of Higgs, the self-proclaimed particle in all things is sporting a wild new look, resembling a cyberpunk version of the Crow. There's also Neil, another new character who is the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/"> spitting image of Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series</a> when he dons a bandana, as seen in the release date trailer.

dir="ltr" id="Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">The first Death Stranding was essentially a puzzle game, as players had to guide Sam to his destination and figure out the best route and equipment to help him deliver his cargo in one piece. Sure, the game also had action and stealth as you were forced into fights with package-stealing Mules and the ghostly BTs haunting parts of the map, but the real core of the game was focused on the journey and the destination ahead of you. Adding an extra wrinkle to the gameplay was timefall, a weather phenomenon involving deadly rain that could steal the time of anything it landed on before becoming harmless water, and staying outside too long during one of these showers could ruin a cargo run.</p><p dir="ltr">For Death Stranding 2, it looks like that mix of genres has been expanded on. Couriering cargo, for example, looks even more dangerous thanks to other weather phenomena like bushfires, lightning storms, and avalanches. To make things easier, it looks like Sam will have access to a new fleet of vehicles that can traverse this deadly ground, as well as exoskeletons and floating carriers.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also looks like it has been beefed up, especially with all of the new enemies that you'll encounter. Human foes seem to be smarter this time. we've glimpsed horrifying hand-monsters in the wild, and we're going to need a much bigger gun to take on the skyscraper-sized tar-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Asynchronous multiplayer will also return in the sequel via the Social Strand system, which helped foster a feeling of connection in Death Stranding. Essentially, this allowed players to have an impact on the world, leaving behind useful tools, gadgets, and vehicles for other players to find in their expeditions once certain areas had been connected to the Chyral Network. We're not certain if or how this system has been expanded, but if it's anything like the one seen in the first game, it'll be a welcome feature as players lend a hand to each other in a dangerous world.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSN1rPPKK9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSN1rPPKK9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding's soundtrack is a highlight of that game, as chill beats to relax to at the end of the world made for a meditative experience. We know that Woodkid composed the song "The Wilder" which was heard in the SXSW trailer and that you can listen to in the video above. This isn't the first time that the French music video director has worked with Kojima, as he previously teamed up with the director to create the song "Goliath" for the Death Stranding: Director's Cut trailer. Beyond that,<a href="https://youtu.be/krSy6fI0SBU?t=2038" rel="nofollow "> Woodkid also has several other tracks</a> that'll be in Death Stranding 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Scottish music trio Chvrches also contributed some of the best tracks to the game, and while they haven't been formally contacted to create some new material for the sequel, the band says that it'll be ready in a hot second if Kojima approaches them again.</p><p>"There's nothing formal yet. We’ve talked [and] we've hinted heavily at each other that we would both like to collaborate again," Chvrches synth player Martin Doherty<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chvrches-talks-death-stranding-2-is-ready-to-return-if-kojima-calls/1100-6512094/">said in March</a>. "There's sort of a dance going on right now. I don't want to be rejected by all out saying, 'Can we be on the game please?' and [Kojima] says no. But I don’t know. We're continuing to build a really special relationship with Hideo. And I think we get him and I think he gets us. If the call comes in to do more then of course, we'll be there in a second."</p>

                <p>The first Battlefield Labs test took place recently for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and while participants were prohibited from sharing footage publicly, that's exactly what happened.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982"> Lots of gameplay footage and new information emerged</a>. Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has now reacted to this, saying he is "not OK" with leaks.</p><p>"I am not OK with leaks; they are dealt with accordingly as well," Sirland said on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899346999545086390" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> when asked for his thoughts.</p><p>A new Battlefield feature, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-6-gameplay-footage-reveals-two-big-changes/1100-6529992/" data-ref-id="1100-6529992">the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety</a>, was among the many things that leaked out of the early tests. Sirland said this will be a "key feature in the revive loop," going on to say he's expecting to see "some interesting use" in the next test.</p><p>Sirland was also asked if EA might considering dropping the requirement for participants to sign a non-disclosure agreement for future tests. He didn't confirm anything but <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">laid out the developer's position</a>:</p><p>"We have loads of feedback from the very active testers selected. In good amounts and in the right areas for us to be able to use it. There is a rationale to the approach we are taking, and it's working well so far. There will be more tests and we'll open up to more over time."</p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to possibly get into a future test.

                <p>Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has credited the story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> as being one of the primary factors behind the Capcom game's breakout success.</p><p>Tsujimoto, who was recently promoted to become Capcom's Chief Product Officer, stated this in an interview with <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF05BK60V00C25A3000000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a>, a Japanese publication. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-story-driven-approach-contributed-to-its-success-says-series-producer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> then reported his comments, which explained that Tsujimoto believed players enjoyed how Monster Hunter Wilds emphasized its story more than previous Monster Hunter games and how its immersiveness was heightened as the game was fully voiced. He also credited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-update-will-add-a-lot-in-april/1100-6529750/" data-ref-id="1100-6529750">cross-play</a> with drawing many people to the game and getting them to stick around.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_wNFT4j6qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and sold 8 million copies during its first three days on the market. On March 10, Circana's Executive Director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lk25o4kkvk2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed on Bluesky</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds had the highest launch-week dollar sales for any game since Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and that it ranked 1 in weekly dollar sales across all three platforms it was available on.</p><p>GameSpot liked Monster Hunter Wilds, but wasn't as fond of its story as Tsujimoto is. "The story does provide some context to each hunt and monster but doesn't otherwise add anything meaningful," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">GameSpot's Monster Hunter Wilds review</a> states. "Though Monster Hunter has never suffered for its barebones stories, Wilds' narrative focus draws arguably too much attention to a weak tale when a less-is-more approach would suffice."</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-update-will-add-a-lot-in-april/1100-6529750/" data-ref-id="1100-6529750">first major title update</a> will be released early next month.</p>
