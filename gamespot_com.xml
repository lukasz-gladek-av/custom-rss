                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> occasionally sends you on quests that require you to enter areas that require a key. One of these quests, Lost in Transmission, asks you to head up into Spaceport's Control Tower A6, where you'll need to establish a connection from a terminal there. We're here to guide you through each step of this short but potentially dangerous quest.</p><p>There are two important things to note about this quest:</p><ul><li><strong>You must bring the Spaceport Control Tower Key into the raid</strong>. You will be granted this key upon accepting the quest, and you will not be able to open the necessary door and reach the terminal without it. Place the key in a safe pocket to ensure it's not lost during any potential firefights you encounter. If you didn't bring it or have already lost it, there's a chance someone else will have opened the door, but otherwise you'll need to acquire a new key, which can be found randomly as loot on any map.</li><li>Speaking of firefights, the locked room of Control Tower A6 tends to contain really good loot, so <strong>other raiders will often contest this location</strong>. If you're lucky, your visit to Control Tower A6 may end up quiet. But there's always a chance that you'll need to take someone out, so come prepared.</li></ul><p>When you're ready to tackle Lost in Transmission, follow the steps below.</p><h2 id="Visit_Control_Tower_A6">Visit Control Tower A6</h2><p>Control Tower A6 is located in the lower middle of Spaceport. It's a tall, easily identifiable tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632050-share_20260107_0819330.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632050" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1744" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632050-share_20260107_0819330.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632050"></a><figcaption>Control Tower A6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632050-share_20260107_0819330.jpeg"></figure><p>You can enter the building from any angle you prefer, including the opposite side, but we'd recommend entering directly where the tower is located.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632048-share_20260107_0818510-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632048-share_20260107_0818510-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632048"></a><figcaption>Control Tower A6 is easily identifiable due to its being so tall.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632048-share_20260107_0818510-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you reach Control Tower A6, you'll be tasked with reaching the top of the building.</p><h2 id="Reach_the_top_of_Control_Tower_A6">Reach the top of Control Tower A6</h2><p>Inside the lower portion of Control Tower A6, you'll find that there are actually two locked doors. One locked door is in the main room accessed from the front of the building, while the other is in a room filled with red lockers and desks.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632053-share_20260107_0818543.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632054-share_20260107_0818521.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632053,1300-4632054" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4632053-share_20260107_0818543.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4632054-share_20260107_0818521.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632053-share_20260107_0818543.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632054-share_20260107_0818521.jpeg"></figure><p>Both of these doors lead to the same zipline necessary to reach the top of Control Tower A6, but it's important to check that neither has been opened yet before you use your Spaceport Control Tower Key. If one is open already, then it's likely another raider has taken the zipline up to loot the room you need to access. It's up to you how to handle that situation--be it waiting for them to finish and leave, asking politely to visit for your quest, or simply taking the zipline up unannounced with intentions of slaying them and taking their loot.</p><p>When you reach the top of Control Tower A6, your objective will update once more, now requiring you to establish a connection from a nearby terminal.</p><h2 id="Establish_a_connection_from_the_terminal">Establish a connection from the terminal</h2><p>At the top of Control Tower A6, check the left side of the room for a terminal. Interact with this to establish a connection, which will promptly complete the Lost in Transmission quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632055-share_20260107_0818532.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632055" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632055-share_20260107_0818532.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4632055"></a><figcaption>Interact with the terminal to establish a connection and complete the quest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4632055-share_20260107_0818532.jpeg"></figure><p>While you're here, it's a good idea to go ahead and loot everything in the room. This key room is one of the game's best for finding good stuff, so there's no reason to let it all go to waste. When you're done, just take the zipline back down and head to the extraction point of your choosing to travel back to Speranza.</p><p>For more on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">Arc Raiders quests</a> and more, check out our comprehensive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">guides hub</a>.</p>

One such quest, A Balanced Harvest, tasks you with visiting this hectic location and finding some files on a research project. Getting in and out can be tricky, so we've prepared a guide on how to finish your objectives as quickly as possible.</p><p>You can feel free to bring a free kit into Dam Battlegrounds for this quest, as you won't be required to extract. If you die in the very busy Research &amp; Administration building--which you'll have to visit to complete your objectives--you certainly don't want to lose any good gear. That being said, if you're prone to enjoying PvP, you can always come more prepared for this PvP-centric POI. It's entirely your call, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to wrap up the A Balanced Harvest quest, read on for how to complete each step.</p><h2 id="Go_to_the_Research__amp__Administration_building">Go to the Research &amp; Administration building</h2><p>The first step in this quest is to head to the Research &amp; Administration Building on Dam Battlegrounds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631864-share_20260107_0637091.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631864" data-ratio="0.5667181865018" data-width="1941" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631864-share_20260107_0637091.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631864"></a><figcaption>Research &amp; Administration</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631864-share_20260107_0637091.jpeg"></figure><p>This is a high-traffic area, primarily due to the fact that it contains some heavily contested key rooms, so it's not uncommon to encounter other raiders here. If your lobbies are particularly aggressive because you PvP frequently, you may find getting in and out of here alive can be a challenge.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Nintendo Won The Console War</p>
      </div>
<p>The Switch 2 didn't fare much better in European countries, with UK sales having a reported fall of 16% compared to the Switch 1 in Holiday 2017. In France, Switch 2 unit numbers for its inaugural year are reportedly over 30% lower than what the Switch 1 achieved during its first year.</p><p>The difference is less steep in Japan, where the Switch 2 only had a 5.5% decline from Switch 1 holiday numbers in 2017. Overall, the Switch 2 still had a strong first year, with Switch 2 sales being higher than Switch 1's first-year sales in the UK (by 6%) and Japan (by 11%).</p><p>An unnamed "senior Nintendo employee" speaking to The Game Business attributed the slight decline to the "complicated economic landscape" and "the absence of a major Western game." During the holiday season, Nintendo itself published Kirby Air Riders, which has proven to be popular in Japan, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, which received a mixed response from fans.</p><p>Though hardware sales in general are faltering, that isn't to take away from the Switch 2's accomplishments, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">over 10 million units sold in its first four months</a>. Upcoming first-party Switch 2 offerings include an upgrade for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baby-waluigi-cries-waaaah-in-mario-tennis-fever/1100-6537275/" data-ref-id="1100-6537275">Baby Waluigi-starring Mario Tennis Fever</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has released a new overview trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-announced-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6534693/">Mario Tennis Fever, the upcoming sports game for Switch 2</a>. While the video goes over various modes and special rackets, the most important revelation is Baby Waluigi. He's a real playable character, and he's spectacular.</p><p dir="ltr">Baby Waluigi isn't the only newcomer to Mario Tennis Fever, though. The game will feature Goomba, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, and Baby Wario for the first time as part of the playable cast, consisting of 38 characters overall. The sports title will also serve up 30 Fever Rackets. Nintendo showcased some of the special abilities tied to these frames, such as the Pokey Racket and Golden Dash Racket. The former spawns enemies on your opponent's court, while the latter can make your character super agile.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Tennis Fever – Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo also detailed how to counter Fever shots. If players can volley the ball back--meaning not allowing it to bounce off the court--the special effect can be sent back. For instance, the Ice Racket creates a frozen surface on the court. Instead of this slippery area appearing on your side, you can volley the Fever shot back to your opponent.</p><p dir="ltr">Other tidbits from the new Mario Tennis Fever video include the fact that Fever Rackets can be disabled for more straightforward matches. In addition, the Switch 2 title has GameShare capabilities, letting nearby players on Switch 2 and Switch join multiplayer matches locally without a copy of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Tennis Fever is set to launch February 12, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-2026-game-preorder-buying-guide/1100-6534725/">preorders are live</a> for the Switch 2 exclusive. It's the first entry in the Mario spin-off series since Mario Tennis Aces in 2018.</p>
