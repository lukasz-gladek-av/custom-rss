                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> Season 27: Amped goes live on November 4. It arrives with a big map update for Olympus, aerial combat buffs for Valkyrie and Horizon, new compatibility between the Alternator and the Double Tap, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">We received early info about the upcoming season from several members of the development team at Respawn. Senior level designer Michael Shannon, Legend designer Ian Holstead, weapons designer Casey O'Brien, and lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese all provided us with details about what's to come in Season 27.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New heights for Olympus</h2><p dir="ltr">This season's rework for Olympus focuses on verticality and airborne action. Four new points-of-interest have been added, each embracing Olympus's anti-gravity nature in its own unique way. Somers University, Gravity Engine, Stabilizer, and Dockyard are all designed to get players into airborne firefights and moving around the map faster.</p><p dir="ltr">Somers University replaces Orbital Cannon and adds high-flying lifts to Olympus, while Gravity Engine replaces Energy Depot with a zone full of high-altitude zip rails. Stabilizer replaces Docks, adding floating, traversible rocks from the planet below to the map proper. Dockyard doesn't replace an existing POI, but, instead, is an upgrade to the camp near Hydroponics.</p><p dir="ltr">"For players looking for high kill games, new POIs like Gravity Engine and Somers University bring new hot drop potential to the map, adding Horizon lifts, zip rails, and an emphasis on movement," Shannon said. "Combined with other countless small improvements, we think there is something for everyone in this update."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593760" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593760"></a><figcaption>Somers University on Olympus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593760-olympussomersuniversity.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Own the skies with Valkyrie</h2><p dir="ltr">Valkyrie's Season 27 buffs allow her to take full control of the skies with major changes to her entire kit. Her VTOL Jets passive ability recharges three times faster and gains a speed boost. Her Skyward Dive ultimate takes off quicker as well. And, finally, her Missile Swarm tactical no longer harms her if she accidently gets caught in her own crossfire, scans enemies on hit, and forces movement-focused passive abilities of other Legends to enter cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">"Valkyrie was revolutionary when she launched, but the game has caught up with her. What used to be a totally unique ultimate ability now competes with jump towers, and her jetpack just hasn't been keeping pace," Holstead said. "Valkyrie should feel dangerous in motion again, with a modernized jetpack that cuts down the cooldown, boosts flight speed, and is more responsive overall, so you're not just a sitting duck," explained Holstead.</p><p dir="ltr">It's true that Valkyrie often feels like an easy target, just floating around in the air, whenever she uses her VTOL Jets for any kind of extended aerial movement. It seems as though these buffs should give her more of a fighting chance, along with a bit more survivability when she decides to take to the skies.</p><p dir="ltr">"Instead of feeling like a budget dash, her jetpack now delivers on that jetfighter fantasy. We've also given her ultimate ability sharper quality-of-life upgrades, like faster launches and the new Super Sonic upgrade option, so it's viable in situations it never was before," Holstead said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593761"></a><figcaption>Valkyrie firing her Missile Swarm.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593761-valkyriemissiles.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Defy gravity with Horizon</h2><p dir="ltr">Like Valkyrie, Horizon's buffs also improve the movement aspects of her kit. Horizon can now fast-fall by crouching in mid-air, or she can choose to glide out of her Gravity Lift tactical ability, which now offers more aerial control options than it did before. Additionally, Horizon's Gravity Lift has a shorter cooldown, quicker lift speed, and regains charges on knockdowns. The Black Hole ultimate also gets a small upgrade by gaining more health.</p><p dir="ltr">"Horizon has stayed powerful in the right hands, but nerfs left her feeling less exciting. Our goal was to give her more fun and movement-based options while restoring a bit of the power that had been taken away," Holstead said. "Horizon reclaims her role as the master of verticality, with sharper, more fluid tools for both aerial dominance and quick re-engagement. By restoring her movement fantasy, we've made her kit both fun and formidable."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593763" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593763"></a><figcaption>Horizon using her Gravity Lift against Conduit.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593763-horizonliftvsconduit.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Lock down the ground with Rampart</h2><p dir="ltr">Rampart is also receiving a notable buff in Season 27, with a better Amped Cover tactical ability that gets stronger over time. Her walls now gain higher health pools as your own Evo level increases, regenerate health when they're not being shot at, and include a new roof to block incoming fire from above. While behind the Amped Cover, you and your allies will also now get faster reloads and infinite ammo. This is a much-needed buff tune-up for a Legend that has fallen into a niche behind the other controller Legends in the game (like Wattson and Caustic).</p><p dir="ltr">"Rampart's always had a strong fantasy, but her walls didn't always deliver beyond poke fights. We wanted her to cover to matter in more situations, especially late game. This season, we've doubled down on her tactical identity," Holstead said. "Rampart is less static and more dynamic, turning defense into momentum with infinite ammo, faster reloads, and walls that regenerate. Her toolkit shifts her from a static defender to a springboard to help her squad push."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593764"></a><figcaption>Rampart firing from behind her improved Amped Cover.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593764-ramparttactical.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon and movement improvements</h2><p dir="ltr">Players have been suggesting Respawn add Double Tap Hop-Up compatibility to the Alternator for some time now, seeing as the submachine gun has two barrels but only fires one at a time--hence the name "Alternator." This update allows the Alternator to fire both barrels at once if you unlock the Double Tap Hop-Up attachment, giving it more close-range firepower. Hop-Ups were removed from ground loot in Season 26, so now you need to unlock the pre-attached Double Tap Hop-Up through the new in-match points system.</p><p dir="ltr">"This Double Tap is unlike any other version we've so far introduced into Apex Legends. The Alternator's Double Tap Hop Up takes the speed of velocity to a whole new level by firing both shots at the exact, yes, exact, same time. It's incredibly deadly at closer range, and most importantly, incredibly fun," O'Brien said.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 27 makes changes to movement, too. When done correctly, a Mantle Boost gives you a little burst of speed that launches you forward after climbing up from ledges or walls, but it's not a feature that the average player likely even knows about. The devs are looking to change that in Season 27.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're adding a Mantle Boost indicator so players can easily see when and how to activate the high-octane movement ability, opening up the mechanic and introducing new ways to play for a much wider base of players," Cavanese said. "In the name of velocity, it only felt right to bring back in the 'hot wheels,' which brought with it some necessary quality-of-life changes like visual damage and better collision."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4593765"></a><figcaption>Rampart performing a Mantle Boost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1775/17752664/4593765-mantleboostaction.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Wildcard updates</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-adds-chaotic-new-permanent-party-mode-called-wild-card-in-season-26/1100-6533535/" data-ref-id="1100-6533535">Wildcard mode</a> was added in Season 26. It’s a new permanent battle royale party mode that prioritizes fun over game balance through Wild Card items that give players exciting abilities. It also contains Mythic versions of weapons as floor loot, making everyone feel extremely powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Wildcard is changing things up a bit to keep the gameplay fresh going into Season 27. You'll be able to play on Olympus in Wildcard this season, and the limited-time Supersonic Event will bring Legendary skins for Horizon, Crypto, Sparrow, Mirage, and Catalyst to the game. The event will run from November 18 to December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new surprises in the mode include a Mythic R-99 that fires Valkyrie's Missile Swarm tactical ability and several new cards, including Burning Rubber (leaves a trail of fire wherever you go) and Extra Zippy (refills shields on ziplines and zip rails).</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Switch, and PC. All versions support cross-play and cross-progression.</p>

The trailer shows the player character booting up the NES classic Ice Climber, but it's unclear if you can play more than one game per system, and which games are available to play.</p><p>Of course, if you have an active Nintendo Switch Online subscription, you can already play games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nes-and-snes-game-on-nintendo-switch-online/2900-3023/#10" data-ref-id="2900-3023">Ice Climber on Nintendo Classics applications</a>; playing these games through Animal Crossing: New Horizons is more of a novelty.</p><p>The original Animal Crossing game on GameCube had 19 NES games that you can play through obtainable items, with Ice Climber amongst them. Other titles included Balloon Fight, Donkey Kong, and Punch-Out. Subsequent Animal Crossing games lacked this retro games feature, possibly due to the fact that these games were all purchasable through Nintendo's Virtual Console service.</p><p>Classic consoles are just some of the many goodies coming to New Horizons: Lego furniture and items based on The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon will also make their way to the game when the update (and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">game's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>) land on January 15, 2026.</p>

                <p>Amazon has reportedly cancelled its second attempt at developing a Lord of the Rings MMO, following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-cuts-hit-video-game-division-reducing-work-on-mmos/1100-6535769/" data-ref-id="1100-6535769">a new round of layoffs at Amazon Games</a>. The news came from former senior gameplay engineer Ashleigh Amrine, who revealed on LinkedIn that she and others working on the project had been let go (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>). This comes shortly after Amazon also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-is-ending-new-content-after-season-10/1100-6535786/" data-ref-id="1100-6535786">announced it would stop developing New World</a>, its colonial fantasy MMO, though servers will remain active until 2026.</p><p>"It's always tough to see such a strong team go through something like this," Amrine wrote in her post yesterday. "I've been lucky to work with some of the most skilled, creative, and kind developers I've ever met here."</p><p>This new Lord of the Rings MMO was first announced in 2023, after Amazon partnered with Embracer Group, the current owner of Middle-earth's rights. It was described as a "persistent open-world adventure" that would span events from The Hobbit through The Lord of the Rings. However, details about the game were scarce, and now it seems the project has ended before reaching the public. This follows Amazon’s first attempt in 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-was-canceled/1100-6507052/" data-ref-id="1100-6507052">which collapsed in 2021</a> after a contractual dispute when its partner, Leyou, was bought by Tencent.</p><p>Last August, Amazon Games VP Christoph Hartmann said part of the challenge <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-still-trying-to-find-the-hook-for-lotr-mmo/1100-6526064/" data-ref-id="1100-6526064">had been finding the right "hook,"</a> something that would make a Lord of the Rings MMO stand out. He said the team didn't want to simply repeat what's already been done, noting that the long-running <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online/">The Lord of the Rings Online</a> (which launched in 2007 and still receives updates) already fills that space. Hartmann added that MMOs are "tough" to make because they’re expensive and require consistent new content to keep players satisfied--a big risk even for a company like Amazon.</p><p>At the time, Hartmann also mentioned that Amazon Games is shifting away from being an MMO-only publisher, focusing more on other genres like action RPGs--such as the recently launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/king-of-meat/">King of Meat</a>. Meanwhile, The Rings of Power TV series continues separately, with its second season exploring Sauron's rise--a reminder that Amazon's Middle-earth ambitions remain alive, just not in MMO form.</p>

Nintendo states that in TV Mode, the game will run at 30fps in 4K. Meanwhile, the mouse controls work with indoor decorations and design-making, while online will support up to 12 players as long as everyone is using a Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">GameChat</a> will work, too, meaning voice chat support as well as added camera functionality to see people's faces in-game.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The free update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons--which will apply to the Switch and Switch 2--introduces the Resort Hotel, Slumber Island, and even Lego furniture. The family of Kapp'n runs the new hotel off the pier, letting players decorate themed rooms for tourists. Slumber Island looks to be all about customizing and decorating with friends online. And the crossovers don't stop with Lego, as The Legend of Zelda and Splatoon Amiibo can be utilized to unlock characters and items from those popular franchises. Players will also find new Nintendo items, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-update-will-let-you-play-retro-games-with-one-silly-catch/1100-6535820/" data-ref-id="1100-6535820">playable NES, SNES, and Game Boy systems</a> (if you're a Switch Online subscriber).</p><p dir="ltr">In May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">Animal Crossing: New Horizons received its first update in years</a>, with a focus on stabilizing online sessions.
