                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2's</a> iconic E3 2003 demo, much of which did not appear in the final game when it launched a year later, will finally be playable next week via a Steam Workshop mod for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> on PC, just in time for Halo 2's 20th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod will be available for free and will release November 9, the same day Halo 2 released in 2004. In the demo, Master Chief rides in a Pelican to the Earth city of New Mombasa, where he meets up with embattled UNSC Marines and battles his way through the city streets. After boarding and hijacking an enemy Ghost (a new gameplay feature added in Halo 2), Chief escapes from a pursuing Phantom dropship, only to find himself surrounded by Covenant drop pods filled with Energy Sword-wielding Elites. As he pulls out a plasma grenade, Cortana tells Chief "Bet you can't stick it," to which Chief replies, "You're on" before throwing himself at the Elites as the screen fades to white. All the while Martin O'Donnell's instantly recognizable score plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqZcZk1wOuk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BqZcZk1wOuk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It made a powerful impression back in the day. In an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/04/20-years-of-halo-2-new-maps-e3-demo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo community director Brian Jarrard, who previously worked at Halo 2 developer Bungie, said the stakes and energy going into E3 2003 were off the charts.</p><p dir="ltr">"The response to the demo at E3 was electric, and nearly every Halo fan remembers that demo and where they were when they were first blinded by its majesty," Jarrard said. "Best of all, none of us ever would have expected that 20 plus years later, a group of passionate community modders would bring this demo to life as a full-fledged mission."</p><p dir="ltr">But making the demo fully playable wasn't easy. As noted in the blog, the original demo was built on a version of the Halo engine that no longer exists and isn't compatible with other versions of Halo 2. Halo senior franchise writer Kenneth Peters said the original build of the demo required an original Xbox developer kit to boot, something "in increasingly short supply even within the studio."</p><p dir="ltr">The work to bring the demo back to life was previously announced in a Halo Waypoint <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/cutting-room-floor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog</a> from 2022, where first details on how developer 343 Industries (now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">rebranded to Halo Studios</a>) and a group of community modders referred to as the Digsite team were working on restoring old cut content from Halo and Halo 2, including the E3 2003 demo. At the time, 343 made no promises the demo would ever become fully playable.</p><p dir="ltr">One Digsite member said some aspects of the demo were just smoke and mirrors, with the team having to make some aspects of the demo "real" by using assets from the shipped version of Halo 2. The demo, Peters said, was never made to be played off-script without breaking. That presented a unique challenge, including having to make sense of "barely documented" code "originally written under an insane time crunch" 20 years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">"This was NOT a trivial process, and we should probably layer on a whole page of caveats that come with taking a demo map for an engine that no longer exists and getting it to not blow up the current lightmapper (among other issues that come from letting people go into areas that were never intended to be seen)."</p><p dir="ltr">The Halo 2 E3 2003 demo isn't the only way Halo Studios is celebrating Halo 2's 20th anniversary. A special Halo 2 playlist in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>, featuring Halo 2 maps remade in Forge and gameplay changes made to mimic the 2004 shooter, will go live November 5.</p>

A Netflix executive is doubling down on using generative AI for video game development, even after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">shutting down a Netflix-owned gaming company</a>.</p><p>Former VP of Games Mike Verdu recently announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn</a> he's been named VP of GenAI for Games at Netflix, something he's excited to dabble in. </p><p>"At long last, I am ready to talk about what I'm doing next: I am working on driving a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI," the post read. " This transformational technology will accelerate the velocity of development and unlock truly novel game experiences that will surprise, delight, and inspire players."</p><p>Verdu, a founding member of Netflix Games, continued and touted the technology as ushering in a defining time for gamers and said he hadn't felt this excited since the 1990s. "It was an incredible time to be making games as talented creators showed all of us what the future looked like. Guess what? We're back to those days of seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innovation, which resulted in mind-blowing surprises for players every few months.”</p><p>Buzzwords aside, it's interesting for Verdu to dive into games given that Team Blue, a Netflix-owned gaming studio, closed up shop just last month. The result was the laying off of 35 people, whose past credits include big-name, big-budget franchises like Halo, God of War, and Call of Duty. Verdu explains that was all part of the plan.</p><p>"Pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media about the changes in Netflix Games," he added. "What you've seen over the last several months was actually a planned transition."</p><p>Verdu mentioned no plans or goals were in place since he took the position over the weekend, but insists that he's focused on a "creator-first" vision. While Team Blue has closed its doors, Netflix still owns Night School, Next Games, Spry Fox, and Boss Fight Entertainment, with over 80 games across its library with huge titles on the horizon like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game/">Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game</a>. </p>

feedback from internal analytics, user tests, reviews, media feedback, crash reports, and more, Rechner said. He also noted that Ubisoft has seen the feedback on YouTube, Reddit, Discord, and other social media sites. "We deeply care about your experience with the game, and use all the data and feedback possible to see the friction points you are encountering, what you're enjoying, and where we can further improve certain elements that matter the most to you," Rechner said.</p><p>Ubisoft has so far released three title updates for Star Wars Outlaws that have addressed some of the "biggest concerns" from fans, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-effort-to-save-star-wars-outlaws-continues-with-huge-patch/1100-6526900/" data-ref-id="1100-6526900">bug fixes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-update-aims-to-make-stealth-missions-less-frustrating/1100-6527363/" data-ref-id="1100-6527363">improvements for the game's stealth missions.</a> That said, Rechner explained there are three additional areas the team is looking to address. The first of these is adding "more depth and excitement" to the combat systems with the aim of "further rewarding" tactics and precision.</p><p>The second area is stealth. Rechner said includes "improving the readability and consistency of enemy detection," along with "choice in how you want to approach each encounter." Third, Rechner said the team is trying to refine the control experience, including "improving the reliability of cover," as well as making climbing and crouching more responsive. In general, Rechner said Ubisoft wants the controls overall to be more consistent.</p><p>Rechner said Ubisoft will provide "more specific details" about these changes and more in the coming weeks. The next title update, Title Update 1.4, will launch on November 21, alongside the game's debut on Steam and the launch of the game's first story expansion, Wild Card.</p><p><i>"</i>To our players, thank you again for your support and feedback, and we hope you will enjoy continuing exploring the galaxy with us," Rechner said.</p><p>After Star Wars Outlaws launched in August, Ubisoft said the game's sales were worse than expected, and noted that its teams would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">"fully mobilized" to improve the game.</a></p><p>It was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/18oNmwEFQzGDu0TYVOAcJN/julian-gerighty-appointed-executive-producer-for-the-division-brand" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">always the plan</a> for Gerighty to move on to become the executive producer of The Division franchise after Star Wars Outlaws was released.
