                <p>Xbox's Jason Ronald has teased that Microsoft has "a lot of exciting things to share" in 2026 for the Xbox's 25th anniversary. Speaking to the <a href="https://youtu.be/6Wl8G4k6FoQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, Ronald was asked specifically if more Original Xbox games would be coming to Xbox Game Pass. Ronald didn't confirm anything outright but said fans have a lot to look forward to for the anniversary next year.</p><p>"I can't announce anything today, but 2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox. And we want to celebrate the great legacy and the history that we have at Xbox, as well as defining the future of where the Xbox ecosystem is going," he said. "So, I can't confirm or deny what you are asking, but stay tuned. We have a lot of exciting things to share next year."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wl8G4k6FoQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="264">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Wl8G4k6FoQ?start=264" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Ronald said Xbox feels "a need but also a responsibility" to preserve games from the past and "enable them to be played in entirely new ways."</p><p>Beyond the possible addition of more Original Xbox games for Game Pass in 2026, Microsoft will release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/" data-ref-id="1100-6535992">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> in 2026, not just for PC and Xbox, but also PlayStation 5.

Microsoft also raised the price of Xbox Game Pass significantly this year, leading some to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-should-be-an-easy-choice-but-microsoft-is-making-me-reconsider-my-sub/1100-6535539/" data-ref-id="1100-6535539">wonder if the service is still worth it at the higher price.</a></p>

                <p>Yet another version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/" data-ref-id="5000-92151">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> is here, with developer Bethesda Game Studios mega-hit RPG now available for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim continues to conquer every platform imaginable, and this time it's specifically 2021's Skyrim Anniversary Edition that's available on Nintendo's new console. This new version of the game does come with a few additional bells and whistles not found in the original Switch version, namely Joy-Con 2 mouse-control support. It also sports improved load times and performance in addition to features found in the original Switch version of Skyrim, like Legend of Zelda Amiibo support, Zelda-themed items, and motion controls.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim truly is the gift that keeps giving for Bethesda, as it's still one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>.

Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date. In November, Bethesda's Todd Howard said the highly anticipated RPG is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"still a long way off"</a> and that he's "preaching patience" to fans. Howard has previously said he wonders if it was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/" data-ref-id="1100-6517168">mistake to announce Elder Scrolls VI so early</a>.</p>
