                <p>There have been countless post-apocalyptic video games before, and nature rarely behaves the same way that it does in our world. In Forest Reigns, nature appears to not only be alive in the new world, but also aware and thinking. In the game's announcement trailer below, a human makes the mistake of accidentally damaging a tree, which invites immediate retaliation from the plants.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pok1Rvuv1k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pok1Rvuv1k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Forest Reigns is a first-person shooter that is being developed by VG Entertainment Studio--the Ukrainian developer behind Survarium and Fear the Wolves. The new game takes place in Paris after the City of Light has been reclaimed by nature and transformed into a jungle. Even the wildlife seem to have evolved, as the errant gunshot in the video above ricocheted off the skull of a mutated warthog. If that's any indication of how the other animals have changed, then humanity may be in some serious trouble.</p><p>However, nature is the great equalizer in this game. It can turn against you if you harm it, but nature can also be harnessed against your enemies if you set them up for it. Regardless, it would be a mistake to let your guard down, as nature can just as easily turn against the player if they make the wrong move. The player's choices will also determine the events of the story.</p><p>"We've always had a passion for creating system-driven games, where the player's freedom of action could shape the story and provide unique playthrough experiences," said VG Entertainment's Ruslan Didenko via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forest-reigns-announced-for-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "After years of multiplayer online production, we are now ‘back to the roots' with creating Forest Reigns–a solid single-player FPS with a twisted story, exploration, survival, role-playing elements, and on top of all that, the interactive environment! This is the most daring concept we've ever explored. With Forest Reigns, we aim to bring something cool and fresh to the genre."</p><p>Forest Reigns is coming to PC and it's available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>. The iminium requirement specs are below:</p><ul><li>OS: 64-bit Windows 10</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600</li><li>Memory: 16 GB RAM</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 8GB or AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT 8GB</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Storage: 100 GB available space</li><li>Additional Notes: SSD (Preferred)</li></ul><p>This game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>If you were hoping to see more Guitar Hero-inspired boss encounters, you're in luck. Everhood 2, a trippy RPG inspired by rhythm games and the likes of Undertale, is releasing on March 4 for PC and Switch.</p><p>First announced in 2024, the sequel tells a new story in the existing universe. You'll play as a hero who is guided by a mysterious figure beyond the river of death, with the task of confronting the Mind Dragon. In order to achieve this, you'll once again take part in rhythm game battles, in which you dodge and counterattack music notes, as if you were a small character on a Guitar Hero grid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzGP9Itd1M8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mzGP9Itd1M8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There'll be over 100 songs available in the game, although not all of them will be for battles--developer Foreign Gnomes estimates an 8-to-10-hour playthrough. Combat is also being revamped with the option to upgrade weapons.</p><p>"We wanted to expand Everhood’s most eclectic aspects with our sequel," said Foreign Gnomes co-founder Chris Nordgren in a press release. "You can still subdue evil carrot mages, time cops, robust slime creatures, and all that good stuff to the dulcet tones of Electronic Psychedelic Power Rock, but there’s quite a lot more discovery here."</p><p>The PC requirements for Everhood are listed on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984020/Everhood_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, and they're extremely modest. The original Everhood sold over 600,000 units, according to a press release. It also received a DLC with the Eternity Edition, released on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5, which included custom tracks made by community members. As of now, the songs aren't available on the PC or Switch releases.</p>
