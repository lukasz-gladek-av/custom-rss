                <p>Blizzard has <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24167572/winter-wonderland-brings-more-holiday-cheer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that Overwatch 2's Winter Wonderland update kicks off today, December 17, and that it brings back some winter-themed playlists, along with 6v6 battles.</p><p>In the Arcade, players can face off against each other in three different winter brawls, such as Mei's Snowball Offensive. Here, snowballs will continually fly across the screen when playing 5v5 elimination and free-for-all matches. In Mei's Yeti Hunt, five players must work together to lay down traps and capture the Yeti, who his Winston in his Yeti skin.</p><p>Freeze Flash Elimination is Overwatch 2's version of freeze tag, where players who get frozen can rejoin the match by having their teammates thaw them out.</p><p>Overwatch 2's 6v6 experiment has also begun on the King's Row map. It'll be in role queue format, with 2-2-2 rules, meaning that teams need to be split into an equal number of tanks, damage, and support characters. The experiment will last until January 6.</p><p>There are also plenty of new holiday-themed skins to earn for characters. Playing three, six, and nine games will reward you with the Merry Marionette Echo Legendary, Cassidy's legendary, and Widowmaker's legendary skins, respectively.</p><p>Some games received holiday and winter-themed updates recently--this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-gets-a-cheerful-holiday-update-this-week-with-new-minigame/1100-6528497/" data-ref-id="1100-6528497">Stellar Blade</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-new-free-winter-wonder-level-on-thursday/1100-6528374/" data-ref-id="1100-6528374">Astro Bot</a> have gotten their own.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's no secret that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> has a bit of a loading screen problem. Players will naturally experience loading screens when fast traveling, but will also be met with them when entering or exiting their ship, entering or exiting buildings, entering or exiting areas <em>within</em> certain buildings, and the list doesn't stop there. But players may be surprised to learn that these loading screens actually weren't implemented until quite late in the game's development.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some of those [loading screens] were not there when I had been working on it, and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were," ex-Starfield developer Nate Purkeypile explains in an upcoming episode of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4z0BGj2zmTceUpoQ8W" rel="nofollow ">VideoGamer Podcast</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Purkeypile left Bethesda in 2021 after 14 years with the company, and says he was shocked by the amount of loading screens in the final version of the game. He says the number of loading zones in the self-contained cyberpunk city of Neon was especially surprising, in part because there were so few of them there before the game's lighting engine was finished.</p><p dir="ltr">"It could have existed without those [loading screens],‚Äù Purkeypile said. "A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon. For New Atlantis, I think it's just to make it so you don't have to sit there for the entire train ride."</p><p dir="ltr">Purkeypile did note that some of the problem was "inherent to the Creation Engine and the way it works," referencing Bethesda's decision to stick with an engine some have argued was outdated and ill-suited to the task of holding together a galaxy-sized game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Developer MachineGames has whipped out a second update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: a patch that in fact fixes a whip issue for the rugged archaeologist. It's one of many bugs squashed, alongside double-vision issues after nearly drowning and frame-rate stuttering in cutscenes.</p><p dir="ltr">The second update--posted <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/4lXgd5pRCMbAkv9clGQW6A/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tm-update-2?linkId=100000319960825" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Bethesda's website</a>--aims to address a problem in which Dr. Jones couldn't equip his whip. The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle patch also brings "improvements to global illumination on Xbox." Basically, shadows look even better, with the image quality appearing less washed out. MachineGames also noted that it corrected a problem on PC where global illumination could be disabled because of "playing with below-minimum VRAM graphics cards."</p><p dir="ltr">Last week saw the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-first-update-adds-path-tracing-better-whip-behavior/1100-6528311/" data-ref-id="1100-6528311">the first update for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, offering up path tracing on PC</a> for select Nvidia cards. MachineGames is working on the feature (which is like souped-up ray tracing) to AMD cards in the future, but it's not part of this second update.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/" data-ref-id="1100-6528440">Harrison Ford showed up at The Game Awards</a> and heaped praise on Troy Baker and Todd Howard for their work on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. For those unfamiliar, Ford plays Jones in the five feature films based on the character. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lucasfilm-says-it-would-be-super-interesting-to-make-more-indiana-jones-games/1100-6528369/" data-ref-id="1100-6528369">Lucasfilm seems interested in more Indiana Jones games</a> going forward, though it wants to focus on this one and its upcoming DLC first.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.

Below you can find the full patch notes for the second update:</p><h3 dir="ltr">GENERAL</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where users Game Slot may be reported as being damaged, or may appear to be completely missing, when no actual problem had occurred.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">GAMEPLAY</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where player may be unable to equip Indy‚Äôs whip.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a player may end up with Indy‚Äôs camera permanently equipped.</li><li>Fixed an issue where player may drop and lose their camera if they use the quick-equip (‚Äúkey item‚Äù) prompt to equip their camera while they are inspecting another nearby pick-up item.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">GRAPHICS</h3><ul><li>Fix to prevent ‚ÄúDouble vision‚Äù getting stuck on screen when Indy has almost drowned. To players who have already encountered this issue, repeating the near-drown should clear the issue.</li><li>Some further improvements to reduce ‚Äústutter‚Äù from duplicated frames during cutscenes.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">MISSIONS AND QUESTS ‚Äì PLEASE NOTE THIS SECTION CONTAINS SOME SMALL SPOILERS</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Gina may not approach the secret entrance to the Vatican Treasure Chamber, blocking the mission from progressing.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gina may go to pick the lock to the exit from the Vatican Treasure Chamber as soon as you enter the room, meaning you may miss some very important story developments.</li><li>Fixed a big hole in the floor collision around the edge of the wall around the Ziggurat in Sukhothai that the player could fall through.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">PC SPECIFIC FIXES</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia DLSS may cause performance problems when enabled.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Frame Generation wasn‚Äôt activated properly if HDR is in use.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency Mode could cause performance problems when used with Frame Generation.</li><li>Fixed an issue where global illumination may be completely disabled when playing with below minimum VRAM graphics cards.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lighting may be over bright in interior spaces if Path Tracing (Full Ray Tracing) is set to Medium or High Quality.</li><li>Known Issue: Nvidia Frame Generation may be temporarily disabled if HDR is activated for the first time.

                <p dir="ltr">"There's only so much I can do with hands."</p><p dir="ltr">Raccoon Logic creative director Alex Hutchinson attributes this quote to his animation director, Mike Menillo. It's a funny line, but it's also a short-and-sweet elevator pitch for one of the biggest changes for Revenge Of The Savage Planet, the follow-up to 2020's Journey To The Savage Planet.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge is taking players out of the head of their characters and placing them over the characters' shoulders, as the first-person view gives way to a new third-person format. For players of the original game, this is a radical change, but for the team at Raccoon Logic, it was the perfect way to stretch their creative legs as they try to one-up the last journey.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat in on a hands-off demo during a recent online press event, and while the change in viewpoint is jarring, based on the team's reaction, it's a move that could pay off immensely when it's again time to travel to the stars.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417137"></a><figcaption>Is that a mushroom? Nope nope NOPE!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417137-revenge-of-the-savage-planet.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Shifting perspectives</h2><p dir="ltr">The change from a first- to third-person perspective is not indicative of either option's quality, according to the team; it's simply a matter of preference. "First-person feels more immersive, but third-person is more appealing to a mainstream audience," Hutchinson said. "It‚Äôs a balance. Neither is better or worse--just different."</p><p dir="ltr">From the jump, the switch to third-person felt, from a development standpoint, like a whole new world of opportunity was opening. Third-person allows the team to focus on things like physical comedy, status effects, and even emotion. The player-character shown in the demo walks, jumps, slides, and dodges around the world with personality, and in a way that only this viewpoint can show off.</p><p dir="ltr">"Third-person is really exciting because it gives us the opportunity to add a ton more character to the player's avatar," Hutchinson describes. "We can add personality to their walk and runs, and we can have them exude charm with every action." Platforming becomes easier too, as a player can actually see a platform as they jump on it--or, as Hutchinson described it, "you can see your feet!"</p><p dir="ltr">Player agency also gets a boost from the perspective change, as costumes will now be available for a little bit of intergalactic dress-up. These costumes may look familiar, but Hutchinson assures us that these costumes are "legally distinct," with "Temu Star Trek," "Temu Power Ranger," and "Temu Han Solo" among the terms used to describe them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Two-player co-op and the "sweet spot"</h2><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet will feature co-op, with two players being able to journey through the wild worlds together at a time. The team makes clear that this is not due to any technical limitations; the team is actively choosing to limit co-op to two people in one session.</p><p dir="ltr">Hutchinson says that, in his experience, co-op games with two players hit the "sweet spot." When only two players are paired up, they'll engage each other more through banter or light-hearted jokes. It's not just about the task at hand; duos tend to be more willing to explore, mess things up, and laugh about what's happening in real time. Any more than that, however, and those groups stick to talking about the objectives rather than allowing themselves to live in the moment, or what Hutchinson refers to as a "shared space."</p><p dir="ltr">"I‚Äôve directed a bunch of two player co-op games, from Army of Two: the 40th Day, to Far Cry 4, to Savage Planet, and I love the idea of you and your best friend, or kid, or partner, versus the world," Hutchinson says. "I want people to have the experience I had growing up; on the couch with a pizza, sitting next to your best friend, sharing your day."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417135"></a><figcaption>Oh boy, here I go exploring again.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4417135-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">"Poop jokes and corporate satire"</h2><p dir="ltr">One major returning element from Journey To The Savage Planet is its levity: The first game was inherently silly, with over-the-top fake advertisements playing on TVs and radios within the game world. Those are coming back along with some new ones to seek out, but the game also contains a more biting commentary on the state of the world, particularly in a corporate setting. This is, as Hutchinson calls it, "a game for all ages."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the silliness does come through in our demo, as the hero can kick any enemy away with the push of a button, sending them flying into the air. At another point, they defeat a small enemy that leaves behind some red goo, which then sets a small woodland creature on fire on contact. We even get a brief glimpse of one of the aforementioned in-game ads, where Shama Lama's Ding Dong Academy is offering classes, but with a warning that "parkour and pottery may result in permanent injuries."</p><p dir="ltr">"I think with enough density, people skate over the bits that they don‚Äôt find funny, and dwell on the bits they do," Hutchinson says. "We try to keep the game moving fast, we don‚Äôt belabor a joke, and we let people cause their own chaos for what we like to think of as 'interactive slapstick.' But jokes are always poking a bit and taking a risk; we hope we find an audience who appreciates it!"</p><h2 dir="ltr">A new journey</h2><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is a bigger version of its predecessor, and the team at Raccoon Logic hopes those who enjoyed it the first time will continue to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked co-op?" Hutchinson asks. "Now you can play split-screen on your couch or cross-play with your weird friend from Sweden."</p><p dir="ltr">"You like jokes?" We have more systemic chaos that will let you slip on green goo then set yourself on fire while trying to battle an alien crab with human eyes."</p><p dir="ltr">"You liked one alien planet? Now we have four!"</p><p dir="ltr">Along with those changes, though, comes a bold new perspective thanks to the third-person view. By cranking up the first game's best bits, and throwing in the extra character elements and customization that third-person allows, Revenge Of The Savage Planet is shaping up to be a bigger and better journey--poop jokes and corporate satire included.</p><p dir="ltr">Revenge Of The Savage Planet is scheduled to launch in May 2025 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
