                <p>Finnish game developer Remedy has published its <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a8f88925-c5bf-41db-8ac4-5e6693c8b229/remedy-annual-report-2024.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">annual report for 2024</a>, and included in the document is the disclosure of how much money the company is spending on its upcoming games. This is something of a rarity in the video game business, as many other publishers and developers hide development budgets.</p><p>Remedy said the "initial" development budget for Control 2 is €50 million ($54 million USD). As announced previously, Annapurna Pictures is funding 50% of the game's development budget, and both Remedy and Annapurna plan to create "original stories" spanning film and TV based on Remedy's game franchises.</p><p>FBC: Firebreak, meanwhile, carries a development budget of €30 million. FBC is a session-based, multiplayer PvE game that will be "mid-priced." It'll also be available at launch via PC Game Pass, Xbox Game Pass, and PlayStation Plus. Remedy owns the Control IP, of which FBC is a spin-off.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="377186020" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

A specific budget was not disclosed, but Remedy said it's "in line with a typical Remedy AAA game production."</p><p>For comparison, Alan Wake 2 had a <a href="https://www.hs.fi/talous/art-2000009952209.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported budget of €70 million</a> ($75.8 million), which included €20 million (€21.7 million) in marketing costs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-enters-full-production-as-alan-wake-2-has-finally-recouped-development-costs/1100-6529420/" data-ref-id="1100-6529420">Epic Games funded Alan Wake 2</a>. The marketing budgets for Control 2 and FBC have not been disclosed.</p><p>By contrast, the development deal for the ill-fated Sony shooter Concord was <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said to be $200 million or more.</a> It also recently came to light that WB Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">might have spent $100 million on Wonder Woman</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">cancelling it</a>. Every game is unique, and so is the environment surrounding it, so no comparison could ever be complete or fair.</p><p>Remedy published a group of financial documents today. In addition to the annual report, a year-end financial statement report confirmed that revenue grew during 2024. However, the company's total operating loss was €4.3 million ($4.7 million USD), which was far better than the annual operating loss of €28.63 million ($31 million USD) the year prior.</p><p>Another document revealed <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/09952808-d993-46bf-b6b5-eb56d9c2ef25/remedy-remuneration-report-2024.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new details on how much money Remedy staffers and executives made in 2024</a>. The average salary of a Remedy employee in 2024 was €63,907 ($69,284), which was up from €63,822 ($69,162 USD) in 2023 and €60,103 ($65,149 USD) in 2022, but down from €67,862 ($73,500 USD) in 2021. This average excludes salaries for Remedy's CEO and members of the board of directors.</p><p>Remedy's CEO, Tero Virtala, made a salary of €210,240 ($227,958 USD) in 2024, the same exact number he made in 2023. His total pay package was larger in 2024, though, as it also included €79,820 ($86,500 USD) in "long-term incentive rewards," giving him a total pay package in 2024 of €290,060 ($304,000 USD). Virtala also has a stock option plan that could prove to be lucrative in the future, but in 2024, he did not exercise or sell any options in 2024.</p>

                <p>In addition to being a winner on the PGA Tour, golfer Joel Dahmen is a self-proclaimed ace at Mario Kart 64. The 37-year-old said in an appearance on <a href="https://youtu.be/EqrffNbcpwA?feature=shared" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Good Good</a> recently that he's yet to meet anyone in the world who is better than him at the 1996 kart racer.</p><p>He said he played the the game nonstop in college when he was roommates with fellow golfers Nick Taylor and Kevin Spooner. They might have been better at the game back then, but today, Dahmen claims he's the best.</p><p>"I still have met no one who can beat me at Mario Kart N64. If we do a best-of-10 races, I'm definitely winning 6, 7, 8. I put in more hours than anyone else," he said.</p><p>Dahmen went on to discuss his skills on the sticks, saying he knows the technical ins and outs on how to gain the advantage on Mario Kart 64's tracks.</p><p>"It's more about drifting than item placement. If you can start blocking corners, blocking jumps--if you block those things, then all of a sudden you're just getting ahead. You have to understand angles to be able to block items coming at you," he said.</p><p>One tactic he uses is holding items behind his character to block incoming attacks. He also noted that he's a big fan of the <a href="https://mariokart.fandom.com/wiki/Triple_Green_Shell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">three green shells</a>. With a steady hand they can be used to snipe other racers and knock them off course, he said. He also pointed out how, on <a href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Mario_Raceway#:~:text=Mario%20Raceway%20is%20a%20track,pipe%20and%20a%20sand%20field." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Raceway</a>, it's possible to drift, then fire all three off the walls while moving sideways, to creating a deadly trap for others.</p><p>Dahmen has <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/player/34076/joel-dahmen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one win on the PGA Tour back in 2021</a>, along with 25 top 10 finishes, nine top 5 finishes, one third-place finish, and two runner-ups. He is featured prominently in Netflix's Full Swing golf series.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">next Mario Kart game</a> is rumored to be in the works now for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The Switch 2 announcement trailer in January might have revealed a first look at the game, but nothing is confirmed at this stage--we might learn more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">during the Nintendo Direct in April. </a></p>

                <p>Late last year, ESPN carved out a place for itself in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fortnite-battle-royale-review-laying-the-foundatio/1900-6416891/" data-ref-id="1900-6416891">Fortnite</a> with the debut of ESPN Football Island. Now, the network is adding a second island in Fornite Creative, which will be called ESPN Basketball Island. The two ESPN islands will be connected through in-game portals, and the latest attraction is adding a few new basketball-inspired minigames.</p><p>The first new minigame, Dunk to Win, can be seen in the Basketball Island launch trailer below. It's essentially another riff on Capture the Flag, except the flag is now a basketball. Once players have the ball, they have to avoid the other team's defenders and make their way to the net to score a slam dunk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDGuh11L8bk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDGuh11L8bk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other basketball-themed minigame is Swing Shot, which puts players in Fortnite Baller vehicles as they attempt to land inside of a moving basketball hoop located on the opposite side of the court. There's even a new minigame called The Ocho Obstacle Sprint--which is a more challenging obstacle course than the one on Football Island. The Boxtagon is also making its return for 1v1 battles inside of a UFC-style cage. This minigame can still be found on Football Island as well.</p><p>ESPN's islands are accessible in Fortnite using code: 5265-7665-9581 or you can find them by searching for "ESPN" in-game. ESPN Basketball Island is available now, and it was created as part of a collaboration between ESPN, Disney Games, and developer Meta4 Interactive using Unreal Editor for Fortnite.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lara-crofts-return-to-fortnite-leaked-with-prices/1100-6530088/" data-ref-id="1100-6530088">Lara Croft's return to the game</a> was leaked earlier this week, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaks-hint-at-kendrick-lamar-x-fortnite-collab/1100-6530055/" data-ref-id="1100-6530055">Kendrick Lamar is rumored to be getting a Fortnite collaboration</a>.
