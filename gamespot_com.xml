                <p>While everyone waits for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, Rockstar Games continues to grow and evolve GTA Online. The newest major expansion, Money Fronts, has now been announced, and it's coming very soon.</p><p>Due out June 17, Money Fronts has players taking control of a massive money laundering operation. The character <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Martin_Madrazo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Martin Madrazo</a> from the GTA 5 campaign shows up in the GTA Online DLC/</p><p>"With some creative bookkeeping and a little elbow grease, you'll end up further enriched and the taxman will be none the wiser," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511874" data-ratio="0.55482041587902" data-width="1058" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511874"></a><figcaption>The Money Fronts expansion is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4511874-moneyfronts.jpg"></figure><p>Players will get started by taking over the Hands On Car Wash in Strawberry, turning it into a money laundering operation like something out of Breaking Bad. Players will use funds from the Car Wash to expand into other holdings like the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours.</p><p>As your empire grows, so does the challenge of avoiding the cops. If players attract too much attention, players have to focus more on the legitimate side of each business, Rockstar said.</p><p>The Money Fronts expansion also adds a bunch of new vehicles, including the Karin Everon RS and Woodlander SUVs, along with the Declasse Tampa GT.</p><p>Also coming to GTA Online with the Money Fronts update is a "collection of gameplay updates and changes," including the introduction of a missile lock-on jammer for 50 more vehicles. Additionally, the update will make "several" cutscenes skippable on replays, while arena points will be doubled.</p><p>The Money Fronts update launches June 17 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. As for GTA 6, following a delay, it's now set for release in May 2026.</p>

<p>"I had all these ideas," he said. "So I wrote them down and passed them to my PA, as if it were my will. I kind of understood why people commit suicide. It was the end of the world."</p><p>Kojima also developed serious eye pain that prevented him from going outside or watching movies or TV. He opted to have eye surgery, and this ended up damaging the optic muscles that allows a person to focus. "The doctor kept saying that the brain would adjust. I was not convinced," Kojima said.</p><p>Following his illness, Kojima said he now feels "nervous" and "rushed."</p><p>"I still have a lot of things I want to do--that I need to do. I thought I could do anything if I was independent, but the reality is that I can't," he said. "I always think of other, more weird stuff to make. But if I do that, and it doesn't sell, my studio will go bankrupt. I know all the staff. I know the families of the staff. I have this burden on my shoulders."</p><p>Kojima's next release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which releases this month on PS5. He said in the GQ interview that the game would have launched in 2023 were it not for COVID.</p><p>He's also working on multiple other upcoming games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, while he's involved with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-be-a-new-dimension-of-what-a-game-adaptation-can-be/1100-6528061/" data-ref-id="1100-6528061">A24 Death Stranding movie as well.</a></p>

To kick things off, players <a href="https://shop.marvelsnap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can log into the Web Shop</a> and claim the following free items with the promo code <strong>WEBLAUNCH</strong>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB6daEk16kI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IB6daEk16kI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>1 x Premium Mystery Variant</li><li>1 x Premium Mystery Border</li><li>3 x high-value one-time purchase bundles</li><li>Daily Free Claim Boost: 200 Credits per day</li></ul><p>The freebies available here are pretty good, as these items normally cost quite a bit when using the in-game "Gold" currency. A Premium Mystery variant on its own costs 800 Gold, and that's a sum that typically takes around a month to earn in the game if you don't buy the monthly season pass. Also on the horizon is a weekly promotional event called Web Shop Wednesdays, and players will be able to claim a free Common Mystery Border for one of their cards. A $5 bundle will also be offered, and this includes a Common Mystery Border and 600 Gold.</p><p>Second Dinner has made several big changes to Marvel Snap since it first launched in 2022, with one of the biggest being a complete overhaul of how cards are acquired. Players can now earn Collector's Tokens that can be used to purchase cards, and regular play makes it easy enough to unlock at least one of the older cards every week. The newer cards require more grinding, but earning them is still much easier compared to the older system that was in place.</p><p>Marvel Snap's current season, Masters of the Arcane, also began earlier this month, and it focuses on several of Marvel's mystical characters like Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, and Nicholas Scratch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Funcom looks to have a certified hit on its hands, as Dune: Awakening peaked at over 140,000 concurrent players on Steam for the game's official launch day. This came five days after the online multiplayer survival title was unlocked early on June 5 for people who purchased the $70 Deluxe Edition or $90 Ultimate Edition--which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-isnt-early-access-but-will-let-you-pay-to-play-early/1100-6530320/">offered five days of "advanced access."</a></p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening officially arrived yesterday, June 10, and immediately set a new record for itself with 142,050 Steam concurrent players, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lot-of-people-are-playing-dune-awakening-despite-being-in-premium-early-access/1100-6532178/">A lot of people were already playing the game</a> before then, too. Plus, Dune: Awakening is currently the top-selling game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, with the entry cost being $50. On top of the strong numbers, Funcom rolled out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakenings-launch-day-patch-targets-server-stability-and-bug-fixes/1100-6532340/">a launch-day patch to address server stability and fix bugs</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening - 5 Things To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For context, Dune: Awakening is proving much more popular than Dune: Spice Wars, which is a strategy title. The latter topped out with 8,397 concurrent players on Valve's storefront, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1605220/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. As such, Dune: Awakening appears to be the biggest game ever for the Dune franchise--with four other games based on the sci-fi series coming out between 1992 and 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Funcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/">Dune: Awakening will arrive on home consoles in 2026</a>. That said, the studio hasn't stated exactly which systems will get the game, though PS5 and Xbox Series X|S would make the most sense. As for Switch 2, that seems more up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-multiplayer-guide-how-to-party-up-with-friends/1100-6532181/">Dune: Awakening guide for partying up with friends</a>.</p>
