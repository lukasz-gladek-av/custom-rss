                <p> There were more souls-likes than I could muster the interest in at Summer Game Fest 2025. I've never been one to enjoy the genre in most cases anyway, and seeing how many games were leaning into gameplay loops of dodge-roll showdowns with gigantic, spongey bosses had me checked out at times during the various showcases over the past week. But I played one game that borrows from the genre and didn't turn me away. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/end-of-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-681505">End of Abyss</a> takes a few touchstones from games like Dark Souls, ties it in with a Little-Nightmares-in-space aesthetic, and brings it all together in a cleverly creepy twin-stick shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">End of Abyss comes from Section 9 Interactive, a new studio created in part by former Tarsier Studio developers, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel. The Little Nightmares influence can definitely be felt in End of Abyss. Though the enemy and world design are much different, trading the stuff of childhood night terrors for coldly blue-tinted isolation akin to a sci-fi horror story, there's something about it that feels familiar. Maybe it's the nameless, voiceless character being chased by fleshy monsters. Or maybe it's their brightly colored jacket--here a lime green as opposed to Little Nightmare's yellow raincoat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eot8qV7CuTA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eot8qV7CuTA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, the protagonist in End of Abyss can defend themselves, unlike those in Tarsier's games. Using a pistol with unlimited ammo, or other found weapons like a shotgun I discovered in my play session, the game's twin-stick shooting felt well-implemented. It wasn't very sticky, which I liked, as it gave it an anxiety-inducing effect. Missing shots meant the enemies were able to close the distance and caused me to dodge them, either out of the room so I could create a bottleneck in a doorway, or just catch my breath. Some enemies grew long, giraffe-like necks, which they swung at me with sneakily far reach. Others came in packs of several small bugs that would jump on me, causing me to shake them off and book it, or try to knife them on their approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The souls-like inspirations can be felt in a few ways some players will be familiar with. For one, the map feels circular in that satisfying way From Software and its lineage utilize a lot. Exploring every space felt key, as it allowed me to find hidden caches of weapon or suit upgrade materials, but just as important, I could unlock passageways that helped me loop back around to earlier areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the enemies respawn when you save at a mysterious type of pod--not to be confused with a traditional bonfire--these shortcuts helped evade the same sequence of enemies each time I came back to the area to save or upgrade my character. There are no corpse runs, but the game will punish you for failing to save manually, so these shortcuts back to a safe haven will be vital for survival.</p><p dir="ltr">I got to take on a huge boss monster too, which, despite its sizeable health bar, didn't prove too tricky given my abundance of shotgun ammo I'd crafted by then, but I expect this was a kindness afforded to me in the demo only, and in the full game, I'd have to scramble a bit more. The boss battle felt soulsy too, where each hit devastated me, so I could only afford to mess up very few times. I'm hoping the game can strike a nice balance between being challenging yet not brutal, and co-creator Mattias Ottvall told me that's the team's vision as well.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played so far, the game's best attribute is its atmosphere. There is a chilling stillness to the world. Enemies often stand around, or even seem to lie in wait, until you approach them, sometimes sneak-attacking from behind a doorway or out of a shadow. This leaves you alone much of the time, unsure of what's around each corner. Your scanner device, which can locate secret caches or puzzle areas, echoes through the ghostly halls of the alien world. I suspect the game won't care to answer many questions about where and when the game takes place, and I'm perfectly happy to go along for that ride into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly a horror game, Ottvall told me, but the game has inched closer to that identity during development because its small team featured mostly artwork-focused developers. The mechanics of the game naturally shifted to adapt to the art-driven game. That was an interesting wrinkle for me to learn, as it suggests that the game may have looked quite different if the balance between gameplay designers and world designers was skewed the other way. Instead, we got the icy-blue End of Abyss you can see in the trailer above, which is definitely more up my alley than a demanding combat-first game the devs may have once been targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who loves Little Nightmares, enjoys twin-stick shooters, and doesn't care for souls-likes, I feel what I saw so far is enough of those first two elements to allow me not to get frustrated by its third element. End of Abyss seems to be the start of an intriguing new studio. It's coming to Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.</p>

                <p>Funcom's Dune: Awakening is finally out on PC, but you might be wondering if it's also headed to consoles. Now that the game has launched on PC, Funcom re-affirmed that Awakening is, indeed, headed to console platforms, but not until 2026.</p><p>There is no specific 2026 release date, however, nor is there a set of confirmed console platforms, but Xbox and PlayStation systems seem like a safe bet. Whether or not Switch 2 may be in the mix, too, is unknown.</p><p>Awakening blasted off on Steam to big results, as the $50 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently the No. 1 best-selling game</a> and is inside Steam's top 10 most-played games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clocking more than 135,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>Funcom highlighted the fact that Awakening is available on PC as part of a "classic business model" where you "buy once and own it." This is the full 1.0 launch, not early access, and there are no subscription fees or microtransactions.</p><p>There is a $25 season pass that includes a range of content, including the sandworm, hiroptera, kulon, and Muad'Dib creatures, which are available now. The three other DLC packs in the season pass are coming later this year and in 2026.</p><p>Awakening is a multiplayer survival game set on the planet of Arrakis, based on the work of author Frank Herbert and most recently brought to life in the Dune films from Denis Villeneuve. Players can choose to align with Atreides or Harkonnen and then take part in missions that "influence the shared world."</p><p>As for the movie series, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/denis-villeneuve-dune-3-plans-1236119697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Villeneuve is coming back to make a third Dune movie.</a></p>

Until now, only the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless supported this feature, making the Nova 3 Wireless an alternative--and even more affordable--choice compared to the $130 Nova 5 line.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is available in two models: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3P Wireless</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3X Wireless</a>. The Nova 3P Wireless supports PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices, while the 3X is compatible with Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. The headsets can connect to up to two devices at the same time--one via the included 2.4Ghz wireless dongle and the other via Bluetooth. However, like the Arctis Nova 5, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless does not support simultaneous playback from both devices. Instead, you can swap between the two connections on the fly. That said, by connecting to your mobile device via Bluetooth, you can modify the headset's selected EQ preset in the Arctis mobile app, even while listening to your console or PC over 2.4Ghz.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond slightly different platform compatibilities, the Nova 3X Wireless and Nova 3P Wireless are otherwise identical. They both sport the same lightweight design and flexible headbands as other Arctis Nova headsets, and feature detachable microphones, custom-tuned neodymium magnetic drivers, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. They also support fast-charging, which can recharge up to nine hours of battery after just 15 minutes. Both are available for $110.</p></div>                      </div><p>We haven't tested the Arctis Nova 3, but several other Arctis models landed on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best gaming headsets</a>, including the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, so we’re optimistic about the Nova 3's performance. There are plenty of other fantastic SteelSeries headsets to check out, including the budget-friendly wired Arctis Nova 1. Its audio quality and wired connection aren’t ideal for all situations, but it’s hard to beat its low price.</p><p>We've compiled a list of all the headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line below. Most of these headsets are available in a variety of models, and those with the “X” classification add Xbox support along with support for platforms like PS5, Switch, and PC. So if you’re worried about using your headset across multiple devices (or are specifically looking for Xbox support), these are the ones to get. Those with a "P", meanwhile, are built for PlayStation and lack Xbox support.</p><h2>All SteelSeries Arctis Headsets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wired (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $195 (<del>$280</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $301 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (Xbox, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $300</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P</a> -- $147 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> -- $153 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X</a> -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBQQ1P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5</a> -- $108 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBKD62?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5P</a> -- $120 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X</a> -- $123 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless (PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3X Wireless (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWMYHCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 (Wired)</a> -- $78 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0B8Q4CR52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 (Wired)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

                <p>IO Interactive has announced "key partners" for its upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a>, and they include a series of well-known global brands. In a statement on social media, the studio said it's partnered with Aston Martin, Coca-Cola, Orlebar Brown, HermanMillerGaming, Jaguar, Range Rover Defender, Omega, Nvidia, and Leica.</p><p>The James Bond movie series is known for its product placement, and 007: First Light will have some, too. The reveal trailer showed an Aston Martin DBS and some flashy Omega watches. A Triumph motorcycle was in the trailer, too, but Triumph is not listed as a partner. A Range Rover Defender was in the trailer, too. Walther, the gun company that makes Bond's iconic PPK, is not listed as a partner.</p><p>The financial terms of the deals to include these brands in First Light are unknown. Revenue from product placement in the Bond movies is substantial, coming in at <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/485031/james-bonds-recordshattering-product-placement-by-numbers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported millions of dollars.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755" data-ratio="0.52256770310933" data-width="997" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755"></a><figcaption>A scene from the First Light trailer showing a case of Omega watches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png"></figure><p>First Light launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. It tells an origin story for James Bond, focusing on a 26-year-old Bond who joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to earn his 00 status. We don't know who's playing Bond in the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-plays-james-bond-in-007-first-light-fans-believe-theyve-worked-it-out/1100-6532125/" data-ref-id="1100-6532125">fans believe they have worked it out.</a></p><p>IO has high hopes for the game, as the studio has said it aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">create a trilogy of games. </a>While fans have to wait to play First Light, IO's Hitman game just added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen's LeChiffre from Casino Royale as its latest elusive target.</a></p><p>As for the James Bond movie series, a 24th film is in the works now, with Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on to produce. As of yet, however, there is no word on who will direct or, crucially, who will play Bond himself. Series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">no longer involved with the creative decisions for the James Bond series. </a></p>
