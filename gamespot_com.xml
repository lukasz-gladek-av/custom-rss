                <p dir="ltr">A second trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/catly/">Catly</a>--a cat-raising game that debuted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/">2024's The Game Awards</a> but has since been met with accusations of AI use--has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" rel="nofollow ">appeared on the game's Steam page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer (which is not currently on YouTube) shows a number of features that provide a slightly clearer picture of what the game itself is about. In it, cats with both realistic coats and strangely colored fur prance the street, before the game's cat creator is revealed, which allows players to customize their cat's appearance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4418370"></a><figcaption>The game allows players to create cats with unnatural fur colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4418370-catly.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whether players want a realistic-looking calico coat or a dye job that makes their cat look more like a Pokemon, the cat maker appears to provide customization for both cats' physical appearances and their clothes. In fact, the game comes with a whole wardrobe of clothing and accessories for players to put on their digital felines.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also shows off the game's worldbuilder, which appears to allow players to build oddly charming, alien-looking locales to house their furry friends in. Despite how visually odd some players have found the game, a representative for Catly developer SuperAuthenti says it finds the accusations of AI use surprising, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/catly-creator-says-game-has-no-generative-ai-no-blockchain-and-no-nfts" rel="nofollow ">claims that generative AI has played no part in the game's development</a>. Still, some have found the game's promotional images to be suspicious, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1hdo5rf/comment/m1zej2e/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">claiming there's evidence of the artifacting</a> often seen when an image is AI-generated. According to the game's developers, however, that isn't the case.</p><p>SuperAuthenti has not yet announced a release date for Catly, but it's currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987350/Catly/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>
