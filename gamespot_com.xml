<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Doom: The Dark Ages launched earlier this month, and if you've already finished the Doom Slayer's prequel journey through Hell and a bizarre cosmic dimension, you don't have to stop ripping and/or tearing just yet. Bethesda and Kramer Guitars have partnered to create three guitars based on the game, and they're every bit as flashy and intense as the Slayer--but you'll have to be lucky to get one. </p><p>The three guitars, which appear to be functionally identical and sport different Doom-related visual designs, are classic Kramer, featuring a Floyd Rose bridge and a single humbucker. The brand was well known in the '80s for its shred-friendly axes, and the aesthetic certainly pairs well with a game as violent and over the top as Doom. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503506"></a><figcaption>Glowing eyes not included</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4503506-doom-kramer.jpg"></figure><p>"The unique designs were carefully applied with multiple layers of paint across several weeks, and each focus on one of the powerful weapons in your arsenal: the Atlan, Serrat the Dragon, and the Doom Slayer himself," reads the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/29/doom-kramer-guitars-giveaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official announcement</a>. They were created by illustrator Luke Preece, whose other work includes Gears of War: E-Day and art for bands like blink-182 and Metallica. </p><p>Now comes the bittersweet part: You can't buy these guitars. Instead, Xbox will be giving them away via its Instagram accounts, with residents from the US, Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands eligible to win. Alongside the three guitars, you can win a copy of Doom: The Dark Ages, the game's collector's edition, or special-edition Xbox controllers. </p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a great addition to the legendary series, focusing on brutal counter-attacks and close-quarters chaos. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, Alessandro Barbosa called it "a finally tuned adventure that delivers the power fantasy of ripping and tearing through thousands of demons without losing an underlying complexity that makes each encounter engaging to blast through."

For those who like to clip important, funny, tense, or interesting moments in their favorite streamer's content, a unique badge is available.

When installed, it will show how many times Twitch streamers have collectively died in Nightreign. It does run on an honor system, so don't add a death to the counter unless you've actually died. The widget can also be toggled to show how many nights have been survived.</p><p>While it's only a few hours until you can get your hands on the game, reviews have already shown a favorable response to the new Elden Ring title. Our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">Nightreign review</a> sees Richard Wakeling refer to the game as "fast-paced and thrilling" with an "enticing structure" and "climactic" boss fights.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt Red confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/" data-ref-id="1100-6531871">the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is now in pre-production</a>. For the moment, the project is also being internally called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/">Cyberpunk 2</a>. However, the newfound foreword momentum doesn't mean that Cyberpunk 2 will be arriving anytime soon. CDPR co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has indicated that the sequel may be years away from release.</p><p>"Our journey from the pre-production to the final release date takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-nOVGBRC3N0?si=MjhFgWy8svAGR2X4&amp;t=1268" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt Red's investor presentation</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/asked-about-cyberpunk-2-release-date-cdpr-boss-reiterates-our-journey-from-the-pre-production-to-the-final-release-takes-4-to-5-years-on-average-but-each-project-is-unique/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "Having said that, and keeping in mind that each project is unique and there are many variables that influence the final outcome, I will not lead you into specific years."</p><p>If that leads Cyberpunk 2 to a 2030 or 2031 release date, that means it would arrive a decade or longer after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was released. It's also likely to fall in the next generation of consoles, presumably on PlayStation 6 and whatever comes after Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The bulk of CDPR's resources currently appears to be focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which only started pre-production late last year. CD Projekt Red North America is working on Cyberpunk 2, and a recent job posting for the game suggested that the developer wants the sequel to have "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-wants-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-to-have-most-realistic-crowds-ever/1100-6529613/" data-ref-id="1100-6529613">the most-realistic crowds ever</a>."</p><p>Mike Pondsmith--the creator of the Cyberpunk franchise--isn't directly working on Cyberpunk 2. But Pondsmith has disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-a-second-city/1100-6531705/" data-ref-id="1100-6531705">there will be a second city featured in the sequel</a> beyond Night City, the setting of the first game.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-cd-projekt-acknowledges-development-challenges/1100-6531129/" data-ref-id="1100-6531129">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It will be released approximately one month after Switch 2's debut on June 5.</p>
