                <p>One of the most intriguing developments with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">mouse-like functionality for certain games</a>. That's been a long-requested feature, but players who love using mice appear to have that option on Switch 2 as well.</p><p>During a demonstration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-announced-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/1100-6512819/" data-ref-id="1100-6512819">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening CE</a> on Switch 2 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-supports-standard-usb-mice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>), producer Michi Ryu plugged a wired mouse into the console and began playing with it. He also noted that when the mouse is plugged in, it takes priority control away from the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also incorporate the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between Joy-Con 2's controller and mouse-like capabilities on the fly</a>. That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel. Nintendo also recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-offers-a-first-glimpse-at-how-mouse-controls-work-on-switch-2s-home-menu/1100-6531454/" data-ref-id="1100-6531454">a better look at how the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> will work.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far. Druckmann also briefly discussed the backlash from some people to the game's unveiling.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;t=3886s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Stand Media</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/just-stick-to-your-guns-neil-druckmann-isnt-phased-by-all-the-hate-intergalactic-got-theres-stuff-happening-with-media-right-now-that-you-just-have-to-ignore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Druckmann said he's "very, very excited" for Intergalactic, adding that "it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done." It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in. And I feel like that's how I want artists to carry themselves."</p><p>Gabrielle herself said she received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-star-reveals-the-advice-neil-druckmann-gave-her-about-facing-online-hate/1100-6531450/" data-ref-id="1100-6531450">"a lot of love"</a> about her playing the lead in Naughty Dog's new game, but there was also "lot of hate over me being a woman, me being a woman of color, me having my head shaved; all these things..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItkWqN3nMHE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ItkWqN3nMHE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>She said Druckmann told her to ignore it and have faith that Naughty Dog is "going to make something that we're proud of."</p><p>Intergalactic, which Druckmann is directing, is in the works now for PS5, but it doesn't have a release date. It's not the only game that Naughty Dog is currently building, as it's also making at least one other single-player game, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/1100-6531656/" data-ref-id="1100-6531656">Druckmann is also involved with.</a> It's unknown what this game is, but some are theorizing that it could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us 3.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, HBO's The Last of Us TV series--which Druckmann is involved with--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-finales-intense-trailer-sets-up-a-dramatic-conclusion/1100-6531633/" data-ref-id="1100-6531633">wraps up its second season on Sunday, May 25</a>.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, it's assumed the game will also come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. IO said the game is being developed for "modern systems and platforms."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Project 007 teaser video doesn't show Bond himself, so it's unclear if the character's likeness will be based on any of the actors who have played him over the years.</p><p>What is confirmed is that Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond--the first time ever for any form of James Bond entertainment--and it will be a "wholly original Bond story." Players will "earn their 00 status" in the course of the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that's all we know so far about the plot. James Bond movies are known to be globe-trotting affairs, as Bond hunts down villains across the world. The series is also known for its action, and it's expected Project 007 will include some of this. Bond also sometimes needs to be stealthy, and IO's experience with the Hitman series would seemingly help in this department.</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</h2><p dir="ltr">Project 007 is being developed using IO's proprietary Glacier engine. The company is <a href="https://ioi.dk/careers?panel=job%3Fid%3D5776172" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring a multiplayer programmer</a>, and a previously spotted job ad called for someone with multiplayer experience to work on Project 007. This suggests, but doesn't confirm, that the new James Bond game will have multiplayer.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</h2><p>Project 007 is in "active development" at IO's offices in Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>"Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities," Abrak said. "Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio."</p><p>Former MGM boss Robert Marick, meanwhile, said, "We plan to bring a new take on this legendary franchise to gamers and Bond fans around the world. IO Interactive are masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling." Marick left MGM after the game was announced.</p><h2 id="A_James_Bond_shakeup"><b>A James Bond shakeup</b></h2><p>A major unanswered question about Project 007 is whether or not anything about the project changed due to James Bond stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson getting bought out of their ownership, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">Amazon MGM Studios taking over all creative decisions.</a></p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy. Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</p><h2 id="History_of_James_Bond_games"><strong>History of James Bond games</strong></h2><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><h2 id="The_next_James_Bond_movie"><strong>The next James Bond movie</strong></h2><p>The 26th Bond movie is now in the works, with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond-producers-amy-pascal-david-heyman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on as producers. </a> Amazon MGM Studios will produce the film, but there is no word yet on any of the key details about it, including the biggest question of all: who will play James Bond? Aaron Taylor-Johnson was said to be the front-runner at some point. Also unknown is who may direct the new Bond movie or when it could release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal report from December 2024</a> said Broccoli and Wilson were sparring with Amazon executives over the future of the series, causing important developments on the project to be delayed. Now that Broccoli and Wilson are out, some are theorizing that Amazon might try to get the ball rolling quickly for Bond 26.</p>

                <p>EA's Star Wars Battlefront II is experiencing a surge in players, potentially fueled by the recent May the 4th Star Wars holiday and the Star Wars TV series Andor. The resurgence in popularity for the 2017 game has prompted some fans--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">and celebrities</a>--to petition EA to make a third game. But it probably won't happen.</p><p>That's the opinion of former DICE live producer Mats Holm. He <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), "I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally." However, Holm said he believes there are people "who are talking about it." In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksxy9m/comment/mtp7jn9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Holm said it would be challenging to bring back the team that made Battlefront II. "We are spread far and wide," he said of himself and others who have since left DICE.</p><p>No new Battlefront games have been announced, which may sound surprising considering the 2015 game and the 2017 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell 33 million copies</a>. A report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">EA rejected a pitch for a third game due in part to licensing costs.</a></p><p>Holm--who now works at Paradox--went on to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ks4y8c/comment/mtmzvd9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pitch his own idea for the future of Battlefront games</a>, saying EA should remaster Battlefront II for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles in 2027-2028. After that, and if it's a success, the developers could focus on Battlefront 3, he said.</p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p><p>While Battlefront 3 may not be in the works, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">a number of upcoming Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream.</p>

                <p>Bethesda has announced the next major update for Fallout 76, and it's all about fishing.
