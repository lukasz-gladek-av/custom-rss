                <p>Developer Raccoon Logic worked with Microsoft to bring Revenge of the Savage Planet to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one launch title, but studio head Alex Hutchinson said new games launching into Game Pass can "devalue" them and hurt the industry overall.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://gamersocialclub.ca/2025/06/09/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-talks-success-game-pass-the-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamer Social Club</a>, Hutchinson said "most of the traffic" so far for Revenge of the Savage Planet has been from Game Pass, while full-game sales "have been good." The game is also available on PS5 and PS4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Revenge Of The Savage - 20 Minutes Of Gameplay With The Devs</p>
      </div>
<p>As for bringing the game to Game Pass at launch, Hutchinson said working with Microsoft--and presumably taking payment from the company--was part of Raccoon Logic's balancing effort of trying to reach as many people as possible and making money. The financial terms of Game Pass deals are not made public, but it's understood that Microsoft pays developers to bring their games to Game Pass at launch as part of the Xbox company's ambition to scale the service and attract new users.</p><p>Hutchinson said the "whole industry should agree to only allow games on subscription services a year after release." He said the video game industry should embrace the traditional movie model where a film debuts in theaters exclusively and then comes to DVD, TV, or a streaming service.</p><p>"The current structure will prove very damaging to anyone who is not owned by a publisher soon if it continues," Hutchinson said. <a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1932143109493674096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Hutchinson said Nintendo stands alone with respect to retaining the value of games. "Everyone except Nintendo is also in a race to value content at zero which will end in tears," he said.</p><p>Hutchinson is saying this as a person who took a deal from Microsoft to launch Revenge of the Savage Planet into Game Pass on day one, so what gives? He said the studio's hope with making a deal with Microsoft was to help Revenge of the Savage Planet get exposure that would in turn encourage people to buy a DLC pack or encourage a friend to buy the game. That's not what's happened, though.</p><p>"We haven't seen that, or at least not yet. What we've seen is that content has been devalued and that people are less willing to pay for things, which in the long run will likely mean less games being made and a lot more studios going under," he said.</p><p>As for the Game Pass payments from Microsoft, Hutchinson said it was true that the checks were "big enough to make a difference," but that was "years ago."</p><p>"These days unless your game is tiny, or you're a rare enormous brand, it isn't much. But Microsoft have been amazing partners and we're so glad to be working with them," he said.</p><p>Game Pass is a paradigm shift for gaming, and it's a model that no other major competitor has embraced. For its part, Sony has said it will not launch its new games into PlayStation Plus on day one because of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">how it can erode and negatively impact its overall value chain and ecosystem.</a> Nintendo doesn't have a similar program, either, and is historically known for holding prices, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">in the case of Mario Kart World, increasing prices.</a></p><p>Hutchinson directed Assassin's Creed III and Far Cry 4 while at Ubisoft before leaving to start Typhoon Studios, which released Journey to the Savage Planet in 2020. Google acquired Typhoon for its failed Stadia gaming ambitions, before closing the studio and scuttling Stadia. Hutchinson then founded Raccoon Logic in 2021, releasing Revenge of the Savage Planet in May 2025.</p>

                <p>The isometric gameplay of Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream may not be the adventure game style that you're used to. But this gorgeous title was created by a handful of Mirror's Edge and Battlefield devs who teamed up to bring Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to life. The game is set for a release next month, but you can play it right now with the newly-released demo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFQHUcrJLys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wFQHUcrJLys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Swedish studio River End Games has shared the demo for Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377280/Eriksholm_The_Stolen_Dream/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-c90ad9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>. The game is set in the early 1900s in a world that's not entirely like our own. The city of Eriksholm has been stricken by an illness called Heartpox, and a young boy named Herman has disappeared under murky circumstances.</p><p>Herman's brother, Hanna, is the lead character in the game, but she'll be joined by two additional characters, Alva and Sebastian, as the story progresses. Each of the three main children have different abilities that can get them past obstacles or out of trouble. But the stakes of their quest are even higher than they realize, and the secrets they uncover may ignite "a chain of catastrophic events that will forever change their lives and the fate of the entire city."</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-developers-on-making-a-game-with-16-people-we-do-these-things-not-because-theyre-easy-but-because-we-thought-theyd-be-easy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, the development team behind Eriksholm consisted of only 16 people. Creative Director Anders Hejdenberg acknowledged the inherent difficulty of putting out a fully-fleshed out game with so few people before adding "we do these things not because they're easy, but because we thought they'd be easy."</p><p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on July 15.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, developer Twisted Pixel unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Deadpool VR</a>, the first solo Deadpool video game since 2013. However, Ryan Reynolds will not be reprising his title role from the three previous live-action Deadpool movies. Instead, How I Met Your Mother's Neil Patrick Harris is stepping in to voice Marvel's Merc with a Mouth. Now, Reynolds has shared his response to the news. And if Harris can take one of his roles, then Reynolds will just have to steal one of Harris' iconic characters.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WIhc9hjlTQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2WIhc9hjlTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Harris' first breakout role came in the 1989 comedy series, Doogie Howser, M.D., which cast him as a 14-year-old medical prodigy. That's the role that Reynolds spoofs in this video, complete with Doogie's lab coat, glasses, and antiquated computer. The video also features a cameo from Doogie Howser, M.D. co-star, Robyn Lively, who portrayed Michele Farber on the show. Lively is Reynolds' sister-in-law, so presumably it wasn't too hard to get her for this.</p><p>Twisted Pixel has shared a handful of details about Deadpool VR, which will be an original story that sends Deadpool into the Mojoverse, where he'll go up against Mojo himself and Lady Deathstrike. Players will assume control of Deadpool as he uses his particular skills to shoot, stab, and parkour his way out of trouble. But when all else fails, Deadpool does have a healing factor that rivals Wolverine's ability to regenerate from almost any injury. Even getting beheaded hasn't been enough to kill Deadpool in the comics. </p><p>Deadpool VR will be released exclusively on Meta Quest 3 and Quest 3S VR, but the game doesn't currently have a release date yet.</p>

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">declared a video game voice actors strike</a> against the industry's major publishers over several issues, including AI protections for performers. The strike has lingered almost a year, but the end may be in sight. SAG-AFTRA has announced that the actors union has reached a tentative agreement with the video game companies. </p><p>According to SAG-AFTRA's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>, the strike won't be over until the union members have a chance to go over the deal and vote for its ratification. Specific details about the potential contract or any gains for the actors weren't disclosed in the initial announcement. </p><p>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," said SAG-AFTRA's Duncan Crabtree-Ireland in a statement. "Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary AI guardrails that defend performers' livelihoods in the AI age, alongside other important gains. Thank you, Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Chair Sarah Elmaleh and Chief Contracts Officer Ray Rodriguez for your hard work and advocacy in pursuit of this contract."</p><p>Last month, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-voice-of-master-chief-asks-halo-fans-to-stand-up-for-voice-actors-on-strike/1100-6531524/" data-ref-id="1100-6531524">the importance of getting a deal</a> that offers performers assurances that their voices can't be used by AI duplicates without their permission. </p><p>In early May, the video game publishers put forth what they contended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-and-publishers-clash-over-best-and-last-offer-to-end-the-strike/1100-6531336/" data-ref-id="1100-6531336">was "the last, best and final offer" to end the strike</a>. Subsequently, the publishers made what was characterized as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a key concession</a>" on AI, which may have helped wind down the strike after 11 months. The fate of the deal will lie in the hands of the actors once the voting period begins. </p>
