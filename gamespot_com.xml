                <p>Earlier this year, Nintendo debuted a brief first look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=switch+2+gamespot&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch 2</a> which didn't offer many details about the new console. However, there was a moment in the teaser video where the next generation of Joy-Cons appeared to move over a flat surface like a mouse. Now, <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025027803" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Japanese patent application filed in August 2023</a> appears to confirm that the Joy-Cons will have mouse capabilities.</p><p>The application was publicly revealed on February 6, and it includes an early schematic for the new Joy-Con, which it describes as the "input device." The patent also states that it has "a sensor for mouse operation," which functions in a similar way that normal mice work with computers. </p><p>Adding the mouse capabilities open up some intriguing possibilities for gameplay on Switch 2. Will shooter fans have the option to use the mouse instead of the conventional controller? This could potentially work very well with PC games that were designed to be played with mouse. It's also possible that Nintendo is working on some new titles that can take advantage of these mouse functions in ways we haven't thought of yet.</p><p>What we know for sure is that more details about Switch 2 will be revealed during the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>. Thus far, Nintendo has only teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/">a new Mario Kart game</a>, but there are<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128"> plenty of titles rumored to be heading to Switch 2</a>. EA recently hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/">the Madden NFL and EA Sports FC franchises could appear on Switch 2</a>. As for the previous console generation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 will be backward compatible with Switch games</a>, but it isn't clear how many titles will be playable on both systems. Regardless, fans will be able to test out the new system for themselves at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-to-try-the-switch-2-before-its-released/1100-6528849/">Switch 2 experience events</a> around the world.</p>
