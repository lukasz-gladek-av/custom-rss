                <p>A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">48% of all gamers</a>, by the way--simply can't stop talking.</p><p>Accompanied by the caption "Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning," <a href="https://v45.tiktokcdn-us.com/089da21650d5c53cd0ece9bdffdedac2/68fd05f3/video/tos/useast8/tos-useast8-ve-0068c002-tx2/oEix9o0qfABiQjBlEpAbswEAGiRgfmoBCViIE6/?a=1233&amp;bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&amp;ch=0&amp;cr=3&amp;dr=0&amp;lr=all&amp;cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C&amp;cv=1&amp;br=1858&amp;bt=929&amp;cs=0&amp;ds=3&amp;ft=4KLxRMzm8Zmo0TugXI4jVXOeQpWrKsd.&amp;mime_type=video_mp4&amp;qs=0&amp;rc=M2c5ZjQ8OWg3Omg3aTw7ZUBpMzVyO2s5cmx5NTMzaTczNEBhMi1hXzIwXjExMzFgMzM2YSNxMmxsMmRzYGFhLS1kMTJzcw%3D%3D&amp;vvpl=1&amp;l=202510231716183F8AFA4B6A9D6205A3D7&amp;btag=e000bd000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the ad</a> (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: "Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off." As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.</p><p>Considering Razer's history of making <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/kraken-kitty-line?srsltid=AfmBOorPF5lRBMw9zdVmy9cmMGcbxDiM02bQkIhk8yRN4bujxcZAvGeP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute accessories geared towards female audiences</a>, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent study</a> by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a "nearly equal gender split" among video game players.</p><p>The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like "welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years," "I just put my razer headphones in the bin," and "the casual misogyny is INSANE" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, "razer's sexist btw."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shown a bit more of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, though apparently by accident. Two 15-second commercials for the Switch 2 were found, both unlisted on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, and one includes a brief glimpse of a boss fight that we haven't seen before. Those hypersensitive to spoilers should turn away.</p><p>Both unlisted videos, uploaded on October 15, are titled "Power Up Your Holidays," with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZEWTy9xpk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first video</a> showcasing the previously seen plant-like boss Carvex. But more noteworthy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second video</a>, which emphasizes the Switch 2 version's use of mouse controls and 120fps support, while also giving us our first look at a boss called Xelios. And this boss is spherical!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtEt0Cudt8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grtEt0Cudt8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We only see it for a few seconds, but Xelios appears to be composed of several hexagonal plates that can shift around, with a green sac and pink core at its center. Presumably, you as Samus Aran will have to blast that pink center to hell whenever this sphere-like boss exposes it.</p><p>With only slivers of information to go on, there aren't too many conclusions about the story and events of Metroid Prime 4 we can make, but the existence of Xelios confirms a couple of trends.</p><p>First, there's a clear naming indication with these bosses, with the early-game enemy Aberax (as seen in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W9xes7BZto?si=4oERcI-JJq88Ev7d&amp;t=683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>) and the aforementioned Carvex and Xelios. They, along with the main villain Sylux, all have the letter X in their names, not unlike the members of Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts. Don't expect any crazy crossover, though.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yz3tTS0xPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, footage of the Aberax fight shows the enemy being possessed by a Metroid before it attacks Samus, gaining new abilities and green sacs and pink nuclei similar to those of Metroids. It's possible that the other bosses we've seen are also fused with Metroids. Whatever the case is, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 is heavily emphasizing the "Metroid" part of the title.</p><p>Both commercial videos are still unlisted, but they indicate that Nintendo is priming (pun intended) the game for holiday-season marketing of the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">out just in time for the holidays</a> on December 4, but fans eager to digest anything Metroid-related can look forward to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-1-3-trilogy-visual-retrospective-book-preorder-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3 visual retrospective book</a> this month.</p>

For this occasion, there will be some new updates to the game. One of the biggest changes is an update to the trades feature, which will allow players to trade even rarer cards than the ones that were previously eligible.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, there's a new share feature coming to the game. Players will be able to share up to one card per friend each day, and they can also receive up to one card per day through this feature. This works more like a gifting feature, so players aren't required to give a card in return.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon TCG Pocket has also shared an early look at some of the cards coming in the next major expansion, including the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news" rel="nofollow ">powerful Mega Lopunny ex</a>.</p>

In these two days, developer Valve Corporation pushed out an update for the shooter that altered the exchange rates of these items. Immediately following this update, the prices for these items tanked, with market analytics company Pricempire estimating the losses in the billions. Ethan MacDonald, the company's marketing manager, told Bloomberg that he was stunned by the change.</p>
