                <p>Nintendo has officially revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, its successor to the wildly popular Switch console. Like the original Switch, the Switch 2 is a hybrid home and handheld gaming console, but with beefier system specs and several other improvements when compared to its predecessor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itpcsQQvgAQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itpcsQQvgAQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the reveal trailer, Nintendo confirmed that the Switch 2 will be backward compatible with most physical and digital Switch games. "Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2," the company added. More details on the Switch 2 console are set to be revealed in a Nintendo Direct scheduled for April 2, 2025.</p><p>Since last year, Nintendo Switch 2 leaks kicked into overdrive thanks in part to third-party accessory marketing. Nintendo had previously claimed that information on the Switch successor would be revealed by the end of its current financial year--which draws to a close on March 31--but it remained quiet on any other details regarding the console.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Switch still has several great games releasing later this year. Donkey Kong Country Returns lands on the console on January 16, strategy fans can check out Civilization 7 in February, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition looks like it'll gobble up dozens of your spare hours, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> could be an exciting return to the pocket monster franchise.</p><p><em>This story is developingâ€¦</em></p>
