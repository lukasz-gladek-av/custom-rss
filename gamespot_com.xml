                <p dir="ltr">Fortnite's Star Wars-themed Galactic Battle event has been running since the beginning of the month, letting Star Wars and Fortnite fans alike live out their dreams of becoming a daring spacefarer in Disney's massive sci-fi universe. Today, the event has brought back one of Star Wars's most famous villains, but with a twist--players can directly speak to him, with the AI-generated voice of James Earl Jones providing responses in real time.</p><p dir="ltr">Vader has replaced the Samurai Darth Vader variant on the map, specifically at the Vader Samurai's Solitude location in the bottom-left corner. Players can challenge him to a duel, and if they are victorious, Vader will join them for the remainder of the match--and speak with them throughout by pressing the specific prompt.</p><p><span>Players can use an in-game prompt to hear Vader </span><a href="https://x.com/Zozol_5/status/1923352839457259663" rel="nofollow ">speak any phrase they wish</a><span>, though that does come with limitations--</span><a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1923314247519420468" rel="nofollow ">some players are reporting</a><span> that topics like violence to real-world people, religion, politics, and more are off the table. At least one user has </span><a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805" rel="nofollow ">inadvertently caused Vader to use profanity</a><span>, however.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The family of James Earl Jones provided a statement regarding the event on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite" rel="nofollow ">official Fortnite blog</a>. "James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it," the statement reads. "We hope that this collaboration with Fortnite will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortnite is available now for free on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, PC, and mobile devices.</p>

                <p>Prior to this month, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick assured investors that Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was on track for a 2025 debut, while also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">acknowledging the possibility of a delay</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">the game was pushed back to a May 2026 release</a> earlier this month. Now, Zelnick has shared his reaction to GTA 6's delay after offering an explanation.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-delays-pain-me-how-could-they-not-but-insists-gta-6s-new-2026-release-date-was-about-making-sure-rockstar-achieves-its-creative-vision-with-no-limitations" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Zelnick noted that GTA 6 needed the extra time for the developers to polish the title and turn it into become the game that fans want it to be.</p><p>"As we get closer to completion of a title that's seeking perfection, the needs or lack thereof, for continued polish become clear," said Zelnick "In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach."</p><p>"While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection," added Zelnick.</p><p>According to <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/1519320d-9555-4bdf-bc7a-44791b7f0dd3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two Interactive's investors info sheet</a>, GTA 6 only entered full development around 2020. The document also stated that, â€œaffording Rockstar additional time for such a groundbreaking project is a worthy investment," before adding that GTA 6 is now "the most anticipated entertainment property of all time."</p><p>Considering that the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-hit-almost-a-half-billion-views-right-away/1100-6531396/" data-ref-id="1100-6531396">GTA 6 trailer amassed a half-billion views</a> within the first few days, Take-Two may be right about the game's prerelease demand.</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/">PC version is expected to be released at a later date</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Stellar Blade - PC Features And Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>So what's the cause here? That's currently unclear, but this might be a case that's similar to Helldivers 2. Shortly after the game was released on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">it became mandatory for players</a> on that platform to create and link a PlayStation Network account to keep playing the game. There was a huge backlash to this move--that was later scrapped--and Helldivers 2 was subsequently unavailable for purchase because of it in many countries at the time.</p><p>While Stellar Blade doesn't require a PSN account to be playable on PC, one of the new costumes being added to the game can only be unlocked when a Steam account is linked to Sony's service. It's also worth noting that PSN isn't available in the list of countries impacted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4496254"></a><figcaption>The countries where Stellar Blade won't be sold for PC on Steam (via SteamDB)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4496254-stellar-blade.jpg"></figure><p>For everyone else looking to pick up the action game when it arrives next month, Stellar Blade will offer quite a few graphical enhancements. Support for upscaling tech like Nvidia DLSS 4 and AMD FSR 3 will be available, and there'll be lots of new content as well.</p><p>A total of 25 new Nano Suits are being added to the game, and if you feel like testing your skills, you can fight Xionn's guardian Mann in the Boss Challenge mode. PS5 owners can also get this content, as it'll be added to Stellar Blade for free in an upcoming update.</p>
