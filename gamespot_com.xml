                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-racing-crossworlds/" data-ref-id="5000-654978">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> is fun, but it feels a little too much like other kart racers. The follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-sonic-racing/" data-ref-id="5000-482784">Team Sonic Racing</a> aims to combine its predecessor's formula with the more competitive make-up of the Sonic Riders games, but the culmination lacks both the cooperative nature of the first game and thrilling sense of speed of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders/" data-ref-id="5000-25205">Riders</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sonic-riders-zero-gravity/" data-ref-id="5000-32739">Zero Gravity</a>. All that's left is a game that plays fine, but feels like a lesser version of arcade racer juggernaut Mario Kart. CrossWorlds might have been better off solely building on the teamwork focus of Team Sonic Racing (or, better yet, giving us a true follow-up to Zero Gravity that isn't built around gimmicky motion controls).</p><p dir="ltr">If you have played any kart racer, you already have an idea as to how CrossWorlds works. Like its contemporaries, you pick a character and a kart for them to drive, and then after a brief countdown, do your best to drive around a track a set number of times while going over jumps, drifting around corners, and smashing into glowing boxes that reward you with an item to use to mess with other players. The first to finish the race wins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Summer Game Fest Guest Characters Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">CrossWorlds' main gimmick is how each track can cross into another--when the player currently in first place finishes their first lap, they can choose to drive into one of two portals, each of which provides a clear view of a different track on another world. Whichever portal the player picks decides the outcome for everyone, and the second lap is then run on the new track. As lap three begins, the race returns to whatever the original track was.</p><p dir="ltr">At Summer Game Fest 2025, I played a demo that showcased the CrossWorlds' Grand Prix mode, trying it on easy as Jet the Hawk and then again on normal with Amy Rose. Like Grand Prix modes in other racers, this saw me competing in back-to-back races, earning a set number of points for the place I took in each one. CrossWorlds' take on the formula is three races on three different tracks, concluding with a fourth race where lap one is the first track in the series, lap two is the second track, and so on. There's also a "rival" feature, where the game told me which opponent was my rival, and I'd earn extra points for ensuring I at least finished ahead of that character.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, I had a good time. Racers like this are always more exciting with friends than computers, so despite the game repeatedly reminding me that so-and-so was my rival, I just couldn't muster up the level of hatred in my heart for an AI-controlled opponent that I do for my back-stabbing "friends" who use a well-timed item to take away a hard-fought victory. But I couldn't help but compare CrossWorlds to Mario Kart. The changing maps and rival character are neat, but they don't add anything to the experience that fundamentally changes how you race.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4514620"></a><figcaption>Several guest characters will be included in the playable roster, including Persona 5's Joker and Minecraft's Steve.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4514620-sgf.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's such a shame how large a departure CrossWorlds is from its predecessor, Team Sonic Racing. The main gimmick of Team Sonic Racing was that every player was racing as part of a team. For example, whichever member of the team was in front would leave behind a draft their allies could use to speed up. There was this great back-and-forth, pull-and-push nature to the gameplay, which didn't exist in other mainstream competitors. Being a good racer was still important, but it was crucial to work in tandem with your teammates to maintain your top speed. It was a new way to play a kart racer.</p><p dir="ltr">I think there's a lot that a sequel could have built upon that foundation, especially as a means to differentiate itself from Mario Kart, which CrossWorlds is clearly trying to emulate. Alternatively, if the teamwork element had to be abandoned in the sequel, going even further and switching to the Riders formula might have also worked. That game leaned into Sonic's legendary speed to deliver another arcade racer that's all about going almost uncontrollably fast, while needing to strategically weigh the risks of pushing forward or replenishing your fuel. That focus would also have been a fantastic way to stand out from similar racers.</p><p dir="ltr">By taking the middle ground, CrossWorlds doesn't rise to the level of what's come before. It's still fun, but any sort of unique flavoring it could have brought to the genre feels absent. Granted, there might be a lot more to the game than what I played at Summer Game Fest--if so, that could change my mind about it.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, Switch, and PC on September 25. A Switch 2 version of the game is also in the works, but no release date has been confirmed.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft first announced that it was remaking the beloved action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-518598">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, back in September 2020, but five years on, the game has yet to even get a release date. This week, Ubisoft assured fans that development is still ongoing--but provided little detail on the game's current state.</p><p>In tweets posted from the Prince of Persia account, the company shared that "development continues behind the scenes," and it thanked fans "for sticking with us" throughout the protracted process. Ubisoft also provided an (admittedly beautiful) piece of art ostensibly from the remake, which you can see in the embed below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166/" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Yep, we’re still deep in the game — exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. 🗡️⏳</p><p> This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step.</p><p> Thank you for sticking with us. 💖 <a href="https://t.co/9bKjZHjmur" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9bKjZHjmur</a></p></div>  — Prince of Persia™ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In its most recent earnings call, Ubisoft shared that it plans for the remake to launch by the end of its current fiscal year; this means that the game would be released by March 31, 2026, at the latest. This was a refinement on its previous announcement of a 2026 release window, which itself followed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">multiple reports of development woes</a>.</p><p>While Sands of Time fans will still need to wait a considerable amount of time before getting their hands on the remake, it isn't the only Prince of Persia title in the works. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a roguelike with a cel-shaded and cartoony art style, is currently in Early Access on Steam; its 1.0 version releases in August. The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown likely won't be getting a sequel anytime soon, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/most-of-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team-shifted-to-other-projects/1100-6527334/" data-ref-id="1100-6527334">Ubisoft disbanded its developer last fall</a>.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">a very bad year for the company</a>, Ubisoft has largely remained quiet about its development pipeline. It had a limited presence at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and it did not hold its normal summertime Ubisoft Forward event. This is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">its decision to delay many of its major upcoming titles</a>.</p>

                <p>Roger Clark, who voiced Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, has revealed his newest project--and it's out soon. It's not another western, but instead a game about cats.</p><p>Clark is lending his voice to Ultra Mega Cats, a PvE co-op shooter "where badass cats battle waves of enemies in explosive arenas." Clark is voicing the feline Clint, and he described his work on the game as <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934660290420822433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"another wild ride in the gaming world."</a> Clint is a cowboy cat who dual-wields pistols, so while this role is unexpected and very different, it does harken back to Clark's most famous role in Rockstar's Western.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCut0thGMIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCut0thGMIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultra Mega Cats has players controlling so-called Mega Cats, which are basically cats with super-abilities and incredible power.</p><p>"Imagine living in a world flipped upside down, where rodents and feathered forces rule and cats are shunned. You're one of the last cats standing--disgraced, brainwashed, and trained to serve your former prey as their personal killing machine," reads a line from the game's description. "But that is not enough, as the cat's soul knows no master! Awaken your inner predator and restore balance to this world!"</p><p>There are five different cats in Ultra Mega Cats, including two who will be available when the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882130/Ultra_Mega_Cats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launches into Steam Early Access on June 17</a>. Each cat has 50 different modifications that can be unlocked over time. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Ultra Mega Cats.</p><p>After Red Dead Redemption II, Clark also had voice roles in Back 4 Blood and Tactics Ogre: Reborn, among other projects.</p><p>As for the Red Dead series, John Marston actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-john-marston-actor-teases-exciting-news-coming-soon/1100-6532444/" data-ref-id="1100-6532444">Rob Wiethoff has teased big news for this week</a> amid reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II heading to Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite has lost its crown. Grow a Garden, the breakout game on Roblox, has broken the concurrent-player-count record. It broke over 16 million CCUs (concurrent users) over the weekend, beating out Fortnite by nearly two million. The battle royale held the previous record of 14.3 million.</p><p>Grow a Garden is an idle video game where a garden changes between sessions. Released in March, it has players plant crops and flowers and design their own garden. The plants will grow when they are offline, making for a nice surprise when they log back on.</p><p>"Grow a Garden has more players than New Zealand and Norway combined," wrote Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/comment/mxqxrim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agentsunnyside7_4</a> in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/grow_a_garden_has_now_broken_the_record_for_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a> that covered the huge player-count news. "If it [were] a country, it would be the 78th-most-populated country, behind Rwanda and above Burundi."</p><p>A recent promotion gave players a free pet if they were online when an update was released. They had to be online at the exact time the Working Bee update dropped in order to receive the Cooked Owl pet, giving a clear reason for why so many players were online over the weekend.</p><p>Grow a Garden--while not especially unique compared to similar titles--has captured the minds of millions of Roblox players. It's approachable with nearly no learning curve. It's resonated with players of all ages and has a huge audience in Asia.</p>

                <p>The cloud-gaming service Shadow, which provides cloud computational resources for gamers as well as professionals, has launched a new high-end machine. Called Neo, this new machine runs the equivalent of an Nvidia 4060 GPU and is a free upgrade for users who already subscribe to Shadow's high-end service.</p><p>The company states that this new cloud PC will facilitate "up to 150%" more performance in gaming-related tasks, alongside a 200% boost in "pro software" performance. Its new components enable more options for gamers, such as improved DLSS and ray tracing. In addition to the new GPU, the Neo PC has a CPU with eight vCores ranging between 3.25-3.8 GHz, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and is connected to a 1Gb/s network connection.</p><p>Neo will be rolled out for free to existing users of Shadow's previous Boost tier, while new users can subscribe for $38/month. This upgrade brings Shadow's offerings closer to its main competitor in the PC cloud-gaming space, Nvidia GeForce Now, which offers 4080-equivalent performance at its highest tier. While GeForce Now is considerably cheaper (at about $17/month), Shadow's main advantage is that it provides a full Windows experience. This means that users can directly access and download their full PC games libraries without restriction, as well as use any software that works on Windows.</p><p>Shadow has been around for a while, and it seems to have found a niche with gamers who also want to have access to computational resources for other tasks. While the company once experimented with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-game-streaming-offers-a-powerful-cloud-pc-b/1100-6465346/" data-ref-id="1100-6465346">offering its own set-top box</a>, it now emphasizes the accessibility of its app across many mobile and desktop operating systems.</p>

                <p>Two years ago, BattleBit Remastered caught on after its early-access release and it was briefly one of the most popular shooters online. BattleBit's player count had dramatically dropped since 2023 and the game was seemingly abandoned. Now, however, it appears the game could find a new lease on life with a forthcoming update.</p><p>A very short teaser for BattleBit Remastered's Operation Overhaul has been shared by the game's publisher and co-developer, SgtOkiDoki. There's not much to go in the clips, but it's the first sign of life that BattleBit has had in 18 months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> BattleBit Remastered - Operation Overhaul | Gameplay Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>SgtOkiDoki and fellow indie developers Vilaskis and TheLiquidHorse released BattleBit Remastered in June 2023, and players embraced its easy-to-play mechanics. What the game lacked in visual splendor, it made up for with destructible environments, relatively realistic depictions of weapons, 254-player lobbies, and large maps to explore. At its peak, BattleBit Remastered had 87,323 concurrent players.</p><p>BattleBit's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> hasn't been updated with any details about the update yet and it still has the notice from Valve that the game hasn't had any developer activity for a long time. The most recent peak for BattleBit's concurrent players was just over 1,000, which suggests most of the game's audience has moved on. It remains to be seen if the new update can revive interest in the title.</p><p>In 2023, GameSpot's Firearms Expert Reacts featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-battlebit-remastereds-guns-part-2/2300-6461878/" data-ref-id="2300-6461878">an extended look at BattleBit's depiction of weapons</a> and determined that they were largely true-to-life and realistic, despite the game's low-poly aesthetic.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, PC gaming's premier destination for mods, is changing hands after almost 24 years. Site founder Robin Scott, aka DarkOne, announced the change in ownership but didn't make clear who the new owners are.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on Nexus Mods, Scott doesn't explicitly state who the site's new owners are, only that it took many months of meetings and face-to-face talks to find a new owner that would "respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community." The new owners are focused on "long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform," Scott said, and that the site will continue to be "community-first and mod-author focused."</p><p>"So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal," Scott said. "This is me doing something I probably should've done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott cited burnout and health reasons for stepping away from running the site he founded. Scott said running the website since 2001 and always being "on call" has been an ongoing source of anxiety and "stress-related health issues." While the site was born out of personal excitement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/" data-ref-id="5000-2508">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, it later transformed into a business that consumed his life.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been rewarding, sometimes chaotic, often exhausting, and always personal," Scott said. "Somewhere along the way, I forgot to step back and breathe, or sleep properly. The dilemma of running a major social network that does not rest!"</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that his burnout and exhaustion began to have a negative effect on the site and the Nexus Mods team, making him come to the realization that the "best thing" for the future of Nexus Mods was to step aside and bring in new leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Scott is no longer the owner, he will still be involved in helping guide the overall direction of the site, just "without needing to be the person who signs off on every little thing." In terms of what will change, it doesn't seem like it will be much, at least according to Scott. He said he had already started stepping back in recent years and that the structural updates to the company's ownership are more of a formality to make sure the right people are in control to guide the site into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Modding, and Nexus Mods, has only continued to grow in the last two decades.
