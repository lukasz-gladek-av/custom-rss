                <p>It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><p>Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:</p><ul><li><strong>December 18</strong>: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 19</strong>: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 20</strong>: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)</li></ul><p>As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.</p><p>Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a>, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">is available for preorder now</a>.

                <p>Fanatical is closing 2025 out with a new build-your-own bundle deal, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+25+PC+Games+For+%2464+With+This+New+Fanatical+Deal&amp;fnauthor=mlobenza&amp;fndate=2025-12-16+15%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-16+15%3A57%3A04&amp;fnarticle_id=6536985&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbest-of-platinum-collection-build-your-own-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-22-games-for-under-65-at-fanatical%2F1100-6536985%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best of Platinum Collection</a>. This deal offers a selection of various acclaimed PC games featured in the various Platinum Collection bundles throughout 2025, giving you a chance to pick up some excellent games for cheap. Like Fanatical's other build your own bundle promotions, you can pick as many games from the list as you'd like, and the more games you buy, the more you save. To start, you can pick up to four games for $3.33 each. At five or more games, you'll pay $3 per item. Grab 10 or more games, and you'll pay just $2.90 per game, and if you want the full 22-game bundle, it'll run you $63.78, a $547.75 value--not too shabby for literally thousands of hours of entertainment.</p><p>One of the items you can pick, the SteamWorld Classic Bundle, comes with four games: SteamWorld Dig, SteamWorld Dig 2, SteamWorld Heist, and SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech. So, really, if you decide to add this to the Best of Platinum Collection, it could be a total of 25 games. The list of possible games also includes the strategy game SteamWorld Build as another pick, in case you want to load up on even more of the series.</p><p>With season 2 of the Fallout TV show looming, now's the perfect time to explore the open-world RPGs that inspired the show with Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition and Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition. Both are available as part of the Best of Platinum Collection. These versions include the full base games plus every update, add-on, and DLC expansion. You can round out the selection with Fallout 76, which is an online multiplayer take on the series--though it still offers the same open-ended, first-person exploration and RPG gameplay as the other games. It also recently received a new Burning Springs DLC update that ties into the Amazon Prime Video streaming series.</p><p>For you horror fans, one of the biggest highlights of the Platinum Collection is the inclusion of Amnesia: The Bunker. The Amnesia games are some of the most tense, atmospheric, and terrifying survival horror games to be found in the genre, and getting it at this price is a steal.</p><p>Plenty of other games are available in Fanatical's Platinum Collection, including the narrative-driven RPG Disco Elysium: The Final Cut, the hidden FPS gem RoboCop: Rogue City, the Lego-themed puzzle game Lego Bricktales, and more. Check out the full list below.</p><h2>Fanatical Best of Platinum Collection: Build Your Own Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Amnesia: The Bunker</li><li>Botany Manor</li><li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut</li><li>Doom (2016)</li><li>Dungeon Tycoon</li><li>Dysmantle</li><li>Edge of Sanity</li><li>Endless Alice</li><li>Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li><li>Fallout 76</li><li>Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li>Gestalt: Steam &amp; Cinder</li><li>The Isletide Hotel</li><li>LEGO Brick Tales</li><li>Mini Settlers</li><li>Neon Garten</li><li>The Pale Beyond</li><li>Paradise Killer</li><li>Reveil</li><li>RoboCop: Rogue City</li><li>SteamWorld Build</li><li>SteamWorld Classic Bundle</li></ul><p>If none of these games are quite your bag or you're after something different, there are plenty of other bundle deals through Fanatical.

                <p>The Deciphering the Data quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> sends you to Spaceport to check out some Magnetic Decryptors, and finding exactly where they're located can be a bit of a challenge. However, you've come to the right place, as we'll tell you exactly where you can find both locations you need to interact with to complete this quest from Shani.</p><p>You won't need to extract to complete Deciphering the Data--but we recommend you run a free kit either way, as you may come across other raiders working on the quest, too, and you wouldn't want to risk losing your gear if a fight breaks out while you're busy exploring.</p><p>When you're ready to take on Deciphering the Data, follow the steps below.</p><h2>How to complete Deciphering the Data in Arc Raiders</h2><p>The first step of Deciphering the Data sends you to the Fuel Control building, which is located on the northeastern portion of the Spaceport map. This building is very dark inside, so don't be afraid to turn on your flashlight if needed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313" data-ratio="0.562524500196" data-width="2551" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624313"></a><figcaption>Fuel Control building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624313-share_20251216_0918501.jpeg"></figure><p>In the main (very dark) room, you'll find a ton of computer terminals. Along the southeast wall is a different kind of machine that you can interact with to use the Magnetic Decryptor. This will provide you with a new objective, tasking you with visiting the Arrival Building.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624315"></a><figcaption>Decypher the data at this machine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624315-share_20251216_0957592.jpeg"></figure><p>The Arrival Building is located on the northwestern side of the map, so you'll have to cross some open space to reach it efficiently. Be careful doing so, as some raiders like to try to snipe folks running out that way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624312" data-ratio="0.5628295254833" data-width="2276" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624312"></a><figcaption>Arrival Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624312-share_20251216_0918490.jpeg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Arrival Building, head upstairs to the top level. Here, against the north by northwest wall will be another set of machines. These look a bit different than the one you toyed with back at the Fuel Control building, but they'll get the job done just the same.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624310" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624310"></a><figcaption>Decypher the data at these machines.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624310-share_20251216_0957560.jpeg"></figure><p>Now that the quest is complete, you can leave via any of the elevators that are still functioning. They're all equally prone to have extraction campers, especially if you did this quest at night, but you should be fine as long as you find a safe spot to wait things out and keep your eyes and ears peeled. Don't forget to turn the quest in when you get back to Speranza.</p><p>For more on Arc Raiders, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-guides-hub/1100-6536157/" data-ref-id="1100-6536157">comprehensive guides hub</a>.</p>

It can be challenging to round up each location you need to visit, after all, and find out exactly what to interact with in each spot. Luckily, we've got you covered below.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to complete every step of this quest in a single round. This means that dying before you wrap things up will result in you having to redo the steps next time you load in. However, you do not need to extract to get credit for completion, so once you've finished the quest, dying won't be as big of a deal. We'd still recommend you try to extract, though, of course.</p><p>When you're ready to knock out The Stench of Corruption, follow the steps below.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</a></li><li><a href="#Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</a></li><li><a href="#Search_the_room_for_any_clues_of_the_saboteur_s_identity">Search the room for any clues of the saboteur's identity</a></li><li><a href="#Reach_the_tunnels_below_the_Spaceport">Reach the tunnels below the Spaceport</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_key_on_any_Flushing_Terminal_to_override_the_bypass_protocol">Use the key on any Flushing Terminal to override the bypass protocol</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Reach_the_southwest_lobby_of_the_Departure_Building">Reach the southwest lobby of the Departure Building</h2><p>Your first stop is the Departure Building on Spaceport, which can be found near the middle of the map, just west of the Launch Tower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282" data-ratio="0.56416028815849" data-width="2221" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4624282"></a><figcaption>Departure Building location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4624282-share_20251216_0911520.jpeg"></figure><p>Since you'll be visiting the southwest lobby for the next part of the quest, we'd recommend approaching the building from that direction anyway.</p><h2 id="Find_the_staff_locker_room">Find the staff locker room</h2><p>The staff locker room is located in the southwest lobby on the bottom floor of the Departure Building.

They also feature 3.5-inch screens and come with four pre-installed games.

These My Arcade Mighty Players are a bit cheaper than the Arcade1Up Countercades and their $150 price tag--however, a few Countercades are currently on sale for $130, making them worth a closer look ahead of the holidays. This includes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-Ms-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Class of '81 Ms. Pac-Man/Galaga Countercade</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Countercade-Classic-Portable-Table-top/dp/B0DJGHWD1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man Countercade</a>.</p><p>The former includes Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, and DigDug, while the latter offers Pac-Man, Super Pac-Man, and Pac-Mania. Both include a 7-inch LCD display (which is quite a bit larger than the 3.5-inch display of My Arcade), so be sure to give them a look while they're on sale.</p><p>Interested in other retro gaming solutions?

                <p>Steam Replay for 2025 is now available, giving players a fun way to look back at their year in gaming. It shows what games you played, how much time you spent playing, and other simple stats from the year. Many platforms now do yearly summaries like this, with Spotify Wrapped starting the trend, and services like YouTube and Twitch followed by showing users what they watched and enjoyed in 2025.</p><p>Valve's Steam Replay covers your playtime from January 1, 2025, through the end of December 14, 2025. This gives players a clear picture of most of their gaming year, and also focuses on their habits--such as how many games they played games with either a keyboard or controller--and highlights their most-played games. This year, I finally really got into games on Steam with Peak and Repo, and I'm still dabbling with Lethal Company.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>It's the most wonderful time of the year - Steam Replay 2025 is now available!</p><p>Take a trip down memory lane and see how many games you played, how much you played per month, and many more fun stats for the year.</p><p>Check out yours (login required): <a href="https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/Zq9vxaFit4</a>… <a href="https://t.co/SrVS9oNdIP" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/SrVS9oNdIP</a></p></div>  — Steam (@Steam) <a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/2001013695598747896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Other gaming platforms have also released their yearly summaries, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">PlayStation posted its yearly wrap-up last week.</a> To see your Steam Replay, you can visit Valve's website or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/login/?redir=replay%2F%3Fsnr%3D1_4_4__118%26snr%3D1_4_4__118&amp;redir_ssl=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">click the Steam Replay banner</a> in the Steam app's store page. It'll be interesting to see how the Steam Machine will affect players next year for those who prefer a more traditional console setup.</p><p>There are a few limits to keep in mind: Steam Replay does not count time played while offline or disconnected from the internet. It also leaves out unreleased games, preloads, prerelease versions, and disabled games.</p>
