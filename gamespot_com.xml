                <p>After debuting on PlayStation 5 earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is heading to PC in early 2025. Rebirth game director Naoki Hamaguchi is well aware that the title's PC debut will almost certainly be accompanied by weird mods, just as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-intermission-review-half-measure/1900-6417689/" data-ref-id="1900-6417689">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> was when it hit PC in 2021. Regardless, Hamaguchi issued a plea to players to avoid any offensive Rebirth mods.</p><p>"While the team has no plans for official in-game mod support, we respect the creativity of the modding community and welcome their creations," Hamaguchi told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/ja/news/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-is-officially-coming-to-pc-and-the-epic-games-store" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games</a>. "Though we ask modders not to create or install anything offensive or inappropriate."</p><p>Unfortunately for Hamaguchi, that may be like asking the ocean not to wash up on the shore. Final Fantasy 7 Remake was almost immediately modded with skimpy outfits for Tifa, Aerith, and other characters. Rebirth seems likely to meet the same fate. However, the modding community has also created mods that are transformative, and arguably works of art unto themselves. It will be interesting to see what mods arise from Rebirth.</p><p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">GameSpot's best PlayStation 5 games of 2024</a>, and it will arrive on PC on January 23, 2025. Square Enix has previously stated that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">didn't meet the company's sales expectations</a>. Bringing Rebirth to PC may help its numbers, but Square Enix has yet to release the sales figures for that title. In November, Rebirth's predecessor received a visual encyclopedia, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-VII-Remake-Ultimania/dp/1646091760?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Material Ultimania Plus</a>. The book features commentary, art, maps, and insights for the game.</p>

Since 2017, new Chapter releases (ESO's versions of expansions) have come yearly, including this year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-gold-road-revealed-will-introduce-a-brand-new-daedric-prince-in-june/1100-6520388/" data-ref-id="1100-6520388">Gold Road chapter</a>. That annual model has been "incredibly successful," according to Firor. The massive updates introduced new zones, quests, dungeons, followers, and more. They normally released in June, and much of ESO's schedule was planned around these major content releases, but because of the strict release schedule, didn't allow the team much time for experimentation.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="235108142" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

months. Seasonal updates will include new story content, dungeons, and events. Next year will be a "transition year" for the team, Firor said, and some of the larger updates the team has been working on will still be released alongside the game's new seasonal updates.</p><p dir="ltr">"Freeing up the dev team from needing to adhere to a strict annual cycle means we will be able to have teams launch content when it is ready throughout the year and not work to a date in June--this will let us focus on a greater variety of content spread over the year," Firor said.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor stressed that while the team is moving away from Chapters and its focus will no longer be largely on adding giant new zones, there will still be new story content and, occasionally, new zones. Larger zones will be split across multiple content updates, Firor said, and stories from previous zones will be continued. There will also be new stories focusing on Elder Scrolls factions like the Dark Brotherhood, Fighters Guild, Mages Guild, and Thieves Guild. For those looking forward to a new ESO zone, it sounds like there will still be one coming next year, but Firor said players will have to wait until April to learn more details on how it will work differently from previous zone additions.</p><p dir="ltr">A desire for ZeniMax Online to experiment on new and different types of content is something it's heard from the game's community, Firor said, and 2025 will see some of those experiments come to fruition. They include revamping the Cyrodiil PvP experience to have higher concurrent players by giving classes PvP-specific skills that perform better in the massive-PvP setting, increasing the standard difficulty of combat while out in the open world, more experimental zones, better guild tools, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Firor additionally said ZeniMax Online will be putting a focus on the game's new and returning player experience moving forward, with visual updates to the game's starting zones, UI improvements, and changes to make it easier for returning players to jump back into the game more quickly.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-developers-have-unionized/1100-6528457/" data-ref-id="1100-6528457">ZeniMax Online recently unionized</a>, which parent company Microsoft has voluntarily recognized.

The bundle for all three will reportedly cost 2,800 V-Bucks.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FORTNITE X SKIBIDI TOILET (its real)<br>Skin "Plugerman": 1500 vbucks, includes a LEGO style<br>Skibidi Backpack: comes with the outfit<br>Skibidi Toilet backpack: 600 vbucks<br>Pickaxe Plungerman's Plunger: 800 vbucks<br>Will be sold in a bundle for 2800 vbucks.<br>Avaible tomorrow in the shop <a href="https://t.co/sHOTXfLSlF" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/sHOTXfLSlF</a></p>  — SpushFNBR (@SpushFNBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Skibidi Toilet is the creation of Alexey Gerasimov, whose YouTube channel debuted a series of machinma shorts depicting a war between toilets with human heads and the Alliance--people who have electronic devices in place of their heads. Earlier this year, Gerasimov reportedly <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entered talks with director Michael Bay</a> regarding Skibidi Toilet film and TV series adaptations.</p><p>Plungerman is an original character created for the series who is part of the Alliance under the Cameramen faction. He uses twin plungers as his weapons in the war against the Skibidi Toilets. Though it's an original "universe," the series makes use of Half-Life assets to disturbing effect.</p><p>Epic Games recently launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, an open-world social-sim expansion for Lego Fortnite. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-returns-permanently-in-december-report/1100-6527620/" data-ref-id="1100-6527620">OG Fortnite</a> returned earlier this month, and it's back permanently. In other Fortnite-related news, Epic Games is sending out its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-settlement-payouts-are-now-going-out-so-you-might-have-money-waiting-for-you/1100-6528329/" data-ref-id="1100-6528329">FTC-mandated settlement checks</a>. The Federal Trade Commission hit Epic Games over Fortnite's "counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." Players who were playing Fortnite before 2022 can still file <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">settlement claims on the FTC website</a>.</p>
