                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-launches-on-ps4-in-season-4-two-new-heroes-confirmed/1100-6534457/" data-ref-id="1100-6534457">Marvel Rivals Season 4</a> will upend the hero shooter's meta with a new hero and some major balance changes come September 12-- changes that include a long-awaited nerf to Luna Snow's ultimate ability.</p><p dir="ltr">In the latest Dev Vision video, developer NetEase breaks down what's new and what's changing in Season 4 but doesn't dive into many nitty-gritty details. In addition to a new Vanguard hero, Angela, to help kick off the season, a number of heroes are seeing significant balance adjustments to make them more (or sometimes less) competitive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRUcdKzw6nQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dRUcdKzw6nQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Chief among those changes is a decrease in the duration of Luna Snow's powerful ultimate, Fate of Both Worlds. NetEase hasn't released the patch notes just yet so we don't have the specific numbers involved, but it's a change that has felt like it's been a long time coming. Luna's ultimate has always been among the best in the game, capable of making teammates within it nearly invincible and able to stop an enemy push in its tracks. Its lengthy duration often brought fights to a standstill, much to the frustration of some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Her ultimate becomes extra annoying when paired with a Loki, who could copy Luna's ultimate for yet another lengthy period of invulnerability. Loki, too, is seeing some nerfs to his damage and healing in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard</a> heroes getting hit with nerfs include Emma Frost and Captain America, while a handful of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelists</a> are also being brought down a peg. Squirrel Girl is having her long-range poke reduced, Psylocke's burst-damage potential is being adjusted, and Black Panther is being hit with a reduction to his survivability.</p><p dir="ltr">On the buff front, a number of Vanguard, Strategist, and Duelist heroes are receiving some help. Blade, Moon Knight, and Scarlet Witch will be buffed to make them more viable damage-dealing picks, while Thor and Peni Parker will receive buffs to their ultimate abilities in order to give them "more playmaking material," according to NetEase. Doctor Strange, often nerfed, will receive an offensive buff.</p><p dir="ltr">As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-strategists-support-heroes/2900-6102/" data-ref-id="2900-6102">Strategists</a>, NetEase wants to give players more options and "bring more diversity in the role." That has translated to buffs to ultimate abilities for characters like Invisible Woman, Ultron, and Jeff the Land Shark. Combined with the nerf to Luna's ultimate, the Strategist field should be a little more interesting in Season 4. NetEase notes that popular heroes like Cloak and Dagger, Magneto, and Phoenix aren't receiving balance changes this time around, but that it will be keeping an eye on the meta in Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Balance changes are just the tip of the iceberg for Marvel Rivals Season 4, which will also add a new Vanguard hero, the Asgardian Angela, to the roster. Angela will be able to wield different weapons depending on the situation, including a spear to dive into enemy lines, dual axes for cleaving through foes, and a shield for blocking incoming damage.</p><p dir="ltr">Team-up abilities are seeing major changes, too. Thor and Angela will gain a team-up that gives Thor the ability to throw and then dive to one of Angela's spears. Existing team-up abilities are seeing some adjustments, with Dimensional Shortcut being removed. Magik instead joins the Arcane Order team up, while Black Panther will join Hulk's Gamma Charge team up, which will grant Black Panther a gamma shield when at critical health.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase additionally confirmed a number of new features coming alongside Marvel Rivals Season 4, including the permanent addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-game-mode-trailer/2300-6465741/" data-ref-id="2300-6465741">Clone Rumble</a> and Giant-Size Brain Blast to Arcade mode, a new map, custom ultimate ability visual effects becoming visible for everyone (with an option to disable it), and another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-marvel-rivals-swimsuit-skins/2900-6764/" data-ref-id="2900-6764">wave of summer-inspired skins</a> for heroes like Mantis, Punisher, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and The Thing. NetEase also announced it's working on adding competitive-placement matches in response to feedback about the game's current seasonal rank resets, though the feature won't be coming as part of Season 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals Season 4 launches September 12, the same day the game arrives on PlayStation 4.</p>

                <p>Preorders for 007 First Light are starting to go live following PlayStation's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/" data-ref-id="1100-6534459">State of Play gameplay stream</a> showcasing IO Interactive's espionage adventure. 007 First Light launches March 27, 2026, on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. Two physical editions are available to preorder at Amazon: The $70 base game for console players is called the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/007-First-Light-IO-Interactive-PlayStation/dp/B0FBHRJ5HD?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Specialist Edition</a></strong> and comes with a handful of in-game bonuses.

A golden cartridge and five bullets have their own slots as well. It looks very much like something James Bond would have tucked away in his car. Fittingly, the display stand has a hidden compartment, too.</p><p>The Legacy Edition also features an exclusive steelbook case. The 007 logo on the front cover is a removable magnet, which is a neat little twist on the average steelbook design. The collectibles, a certificate of authenticity, and a physical copy of 007 First Light are packaged in an understated black collector's box. First Light's Legacy Edition is only available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p><p><em>This story is developing...</em></p>

                <p>NetEase has released the Season 4 trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a>, which confirms Daredevil and Angela as the two new playable characters confirmed for the game. The trailer also reveals Marvel Rivals is coming to PlayStation 4.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4: Heart of the Dragon arrives on September 12, and the new season will introduce the two new heroes. Daredevil, The Man Without Fear, is the most notable of the pair, but some players might also be familiar with Angela, who is a powerful Asgardian goddess and the firstborn daughter of Odin and Freyja.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67FVMNGMFXU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/67FVMNGMFXU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Season 4 trailer above shows what the two heroes will look like in the game, with Angela and Daredevil at odds and battling each other. Of course, their fight isn't the main focus of the season. According to the brief <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1963270773394850207" rel="nofollow ">story summary</a> provided by NetEase, Iron Fist and Doctor Doom will also play a major role in the narrative for Season 4: Heart of the Dragon.</p><p dir="ltr">This tease says, "Doctor Doom seeks to steal the Chronal Chi of the slumbering dragon Shou-Lao, threatening to unravel the fate of the Heavens themselves. Can Iron Fist protect the Immortal Dragon … or will Doom claim its power?"</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more Season 4 details and full character previews close to launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer also adds PlayStation 4 as a platform for the Season 4 update, confirming a last-gen rendition of Marvel Rivals is launching. Unfortunately, Xbox One is not included on the list, meaning Xbox players will still need to play Marvel Rivals on either Xbox Series X|S.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
