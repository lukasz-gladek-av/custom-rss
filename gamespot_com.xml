                <p>Rockstar Games has announced what's next for Grand Theft Auto Online, and November's updates to the multiplayer game is all about what some believe be the game's best and most exciting feature: <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Heists_in_GTA_Online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heists</a>.</p><p>Every week in November will focus on a different GTA Online Heist. This kicks off this week with the Cayo Perico Heist, with more to come throughout the month.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, GTA Online's heists call on players to take part in multi-mission campaigns with the aim of committing a high-profile crime with a lucrative payout.</p><p>The <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/GTA_Online:_The_Cayo_Perico_Heist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cayo Perico heist</a>, which was first released in 2020, has players trekking to the private island of Cayo Perico, fighting against armed guards, and getting away with all the money you can find. Players can take on heists solo or with friends, and coordinating with teammates makes it pretty thrilling.</p><p>November also brings a new Community Challenge, and this one is all about heists, naturally. Rockstar is calling on players to collectively steal $20 trillion worth of in-game cash between now and December 4, and if successful, Rockstar will give out "a vault full of rewards" to players.</p><p>Players who successfully complete the Cayo Perico heist between now and November 13 will earn the Panther Statue, with other rewards to be revealed later for completing more heists in November.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180" data-ratio="0.561850802644" data-width="1059" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4396180"></a><figcaption>The Panther Statue</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4396180-screenshot2024-11-07at10.42.18am.png"></figure><p>For more, be sure to <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/9kk3243ka35572/break-into-the-heist-challenge-all-month-long" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read Rockstar's full blog post</a> to get up to speed on everything new in GTA Online this week and beyond.

Unlike other animals, they are easily spooked by your presence and will run away if they see you coming too aggressively. As such, this can make taming a cat a tricky endeavor. However, as long as you follow the steps below, you'll have a tamed cat in no time:</p><ul><li>First, you need to find a cat, which most commonly spawn in villages. Once you find a cat, approach them extremely carefully. Any sudden movements and the cat will run away. You also want to ensure you're crouching.</li><li>While you're approaching the cat slowly, have a raw cod or raw salmon in your hand. This makes the cat less likely to run away.</li><li>After you're close enough to the cat, feed the raw cod or salmon to it. This will successfully tame the cat, making them follow you around.</li><li>You can feed the cat another raw cod or raw salmon to make them enter love mode. If the cat is near another tamed cat, they will breed.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375259"></a><figcaption>Taming two cats in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375259-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.09.49.12.png"></figure><p>The hardest part about taming a cat is getting close enough to them to feed them the raw fish.

As you might expect, you can find a majority of the frogs in Minecraft in the swamp biomes.

A frog will follow a player holding a slimeball when they are six blocks or closer.</li><li>Find two frogs, get them to follow you while holding a slimeball, and then feed each frog a slimeball.</li><li>This causes the frogs to enter love mode and eventually, one of the frogs will become pregnant.</li><li>The pregnant frog then looks for a water source with air above it.

The process is similar to the breeding of frogs, but turtles can take much longer to lay their eggs.</p><ul><li>To breed turtles, find a beach during the day. You can usually find turtles swimming near the coast.</li><li>When you find two turtles, feed each of them some seagrass. This causes them to enter love mode.</li><li>One of the turtles in love mode will spawn eggs in its inventory and slightly grow in size.</li><li>After the eggs appear in the turtle's inventory, they will go back to where they first spawned.</li><li>The turtle tries to find a patch of sand to lay its eggs. You'll know the turtle has found their spot when they start rotating 360 degrees.</li><li>After a while, the turtle will lay anywhere from one to four eggs.</li><li>Turtle eggs take four to five in-game days to hatch in Minecraft.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264" data-ratio="0.537890625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png" data-ref-id="1300-4375264"></a><figcaption>A turtle with its eggs in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4375264-minecraftscreenshot2024.09.27-15.19.43.83.png"></figure><p>The turtle breeding process will take some time, but after it's all said and done, you'll be left with one to four baby turtles.</p><h2 id="How_to_tame_a_Parrot_in_Minecraft">How to tame a Parrot in Minecraft</h2><p>Parrots are rare animals to find in Minecraft, but luckily, they can be tamed rather easily. This means once you find one parrot, you won't be able to get rid of them after the taming process is complete.</p><ul><li>Parrots most commonly spawn in jungle biomes. Once you find one, you can tame them by feeding them any of the following seeds:  <ul><li>Wheat seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, beetroot seeds, torchflower seeds.</li></ul></li><li>This doesn't guarantee you tame the parrot, however.
