A report from reputable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/battlefield-6-date-de-sortie-editions-prix-precommande-on-vous-devoile-toutes-nos-infos-inedites-60267" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> claims Battlefield 6 will launch on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p>An October release date for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">previously reported</a>, so it's not a total shock. The latest rumor is that Activision's <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will release on November 14</a>. If both dates are legitimate, that would put about a month of time between both releases.</p><p>It's been four years since there were new entries in the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises releasing the same year, going back to 2021 with Call of Duty: Vanguard and Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Officially, EA has only confirmed that Battlefield 6 will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">released by the end of March 2026. </a></p><p>The Dealabs report also mentioned that Battlefield 6 will be available in Standard and Phantom editions, the latter of which is said to be digital-only and will include extra in-game content. The report also claimed that EA will not offer early access to the game, but it will instead debut on October 10 for everyone.</p><p>The standard edition is rumored to be priced at €80 ($94 USD) for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S and €70 ($82 USD) on PC, with the Phantom edition selling for €110.00 ($130 USD) on console and €100 ($117) on PC. The Dealabs report had no mention of pricing for Battlefield 6 in USD; the figures above are only conversions based on the European source. Finally, the report said preorders will open on July 31.</p><p>The first trailer for Battlefield 6 will be releases on July 24. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-teases-all-out-war-ahead-of-full-reveal/1100-6533382/" data-ref-id="1100-6533382">teaser video, however, is out now, and it teases all-out war.</a> An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">open beta for Battlefield 6</a> is on the way, but a date for it has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Battlefield Studios is heading up the development of Battlefield 6, with subsidiaries DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive Studio working on various aspects of the project.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">If there's one thing Ready at Dawn co-founder Ru Weerasuriya wishes he could've done differently with The Order: 1886, it's getting more development time for the PS4 exclusive. He revealed in a new interview that the studio cut roughly 30% of the game to hit the game's release date in February 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ready-at-dawn-co-founder-says-vr" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Weerasuriya discussed how "we really hoped to make a sequel" to The Order: 1886 and ruminated on what happened with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-review-roundup/1100-6425390/">the game's lackluster critical reception</a>. "The game length [<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/">GameSpot's reviewer</a> said it took 6 hours to finish] ... that's something that a lot of people talked about at the time," Weerasuriya said. "We cut ... I want to say 30% of the game a few months before it was released. We decided it had to come out in the time allotted. Were we to do it again, I would've probably tried to figure out a way to extend the development."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Firearms Expert Reacts To The Order: 1886’s Guns</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the week leading up to the game's launch on February 20, 2015,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-leaks-to-youtube-in-full-playthroug/1100-6425327/"> a leaked playthrough of The Order: 1886 appeared on YouTube</a> and showed a person beating the game in five hours. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-dev-denies-five-hour-claim/1100-6425343/">This led to Ready at Dawn denying that claim</a> days later, arguing the game's length was roughly eight to 10 hours long.</p><p dir="ltr">Weerasuriya also touched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-won-t-have-multiplayer-will-run-at-1080p-30fps/1100-6417564/" data-ref-id="1100-6417564">the lack of multiplayer for The Order: 1886</a>. "We did do a multiplayer in the first year of development, but we didn't have the budget and time to finish it and, together with Sony, we decided to kill it in year two, and hopefully bring it back in a sequel," he said. "We had a functioning multiplayer. It was fun."</p><p dir="ltr">The sequel obviously never happened, even though Weerasuriya mentioned having "the story for the second and third one." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4-exclusive-the-order-1886-delayed-to-2015/1100-6419882/">Sony did delay The Order: 1886</a> in May 2014, pushing the game back to 2015.</p><p dir="ltr">The other Ready at Dawn co-founder, Andrea Pessino, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-passed-on-the-order-1886-sequel-dev-claims/1100-6529368/" data-ref-id="1100-6529368">reflected on The Order: 1886 sequel</a> earlier this year, too. Like Weerasuriya, he mentioned the pressure to ship the game led to cut content. Facebook acquired Ready at Dawn in 2020, but then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/">shut down the studio last year</a>.</p>

                <p>The popular soccer game Rematch has reached 5 million players, and now the game's newest patch has arrived, ushering in new features and changes--however, the promised cross-play feature remains missing.</p><p>Developer Sloclap said in a <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that the new Rematch patch "contains many changes in all domains, which should all improve the game in different ways." As for the promised cross-play feature and netcode improvements, Sloclap said these efforts require "the work of specialists in their domain."</p><p>"We can't put all our resources on these topics to make them happen faster," Sloclap said. However, the studio teased that it's making "very good progress" and will have more news to share soon.</p><p>New for Rematch in the update is a colorblind mode that caters to people with deuteranopia, protanopia, or tritanopia by offering a toggle for team colors. Additionally, the player-progression screen has been updated to improve readability. In terms of fixes, the ball indicator should no longer incorrectly follow the ball, while issues with the social panel screen have been addressed.</p><p>There is also a new gamepad-remapping feature in Rematch that is described as "quite basic" for now, but Sloclap said it wanted to start slow here before offering a "more advanced version soon." The new Rematch update also has an improved goal validation system for when the ball is caught on the line. "Decision-making now uses a delay to check for potential deflect/catch and account for network variation before validating the goal," Sloclap said.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>Sloclap also announced that it's creating Test Servers for the purpose of testing future updates in "separate environments."

                <p>After a lengthy stretch of rumors, reports and leaks, the next major installment in the Battlefield franchise is finally being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-trailer-coming-very-soon-see-a-teaser-now/1100-6533340/" data-ref-id="1100-6533340">unveiled on July 24</a>. Before then though, we've received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>'s first teaser, and things are looking pretty chaotic out there. </p><p>The scattered teaser primarily cuts between several news clips providing a lot of context for the game's inevitable conflict. Of significant note is the trailer's emphasis on the collapse of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is an alliance of existing world militaries. In the broadest sense, this alliance is meant to act as a form of deterrence, both to prevent members from fighting and to prevent outside states from attacking a member.</p><p>Battlefield 6 seems to kick off with an attack on NATO though, with much of the teaser focusing on news reports from all around the world about an attack on a NATO base in Mukhrovani, Georgia. Interspersed between these reports is other alarming news stemming from the fallout of this attack, including the assassination of a secretary general at NATO HQ, a frenzied social media response, and the US president's mobilization of armed forces.</p><p>Throughout, repeated mentions are made to Pax Armata, who appear to be the villainous faction of Battlefield 6 and the perpetrators of the attacks, which can be seen spreading to Belgium and then Gibraltar. The Battlefield X account also makes mention of the organization in the teaser announcement, which reads, "Pax Armata rises as NATO cracks. Their motto? 'Our protection, your peace.' But who’s pulling the strings and to what end?"</p><p>The teaser stresses the modern setting of the latest Battlefield game, which was recently confirmed by leakers and eventually EA. The series has been all over the timeline recently, with Battlefield 2042 taking place in the near future while the game before it, Battlefield V, took place during World War 2.</p><p>It won't be long before we learn more about Battlefield 6's gameplay and setting, seeing as the reveal is set for July 24. Additionally, EA and Battlefield Studios have shared that there will be an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">open beta</a> ahead of the game's release where it is expected to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
