                <p>A new trailer for the next EA Originals game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, has gone live and shows off more of the Hazelight-developed game in action. Narrated by game director Josef Fares, the gameplay trailer shows off two levels--one set in a sci-fi world, the other in a fantasy land--and how players will use unique co-op gameplay elements in each one to progress. For the sci-fi level, there are anti-gravity sections and bike chases to look forward to, while the fantasy level features shape-shifting gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TlySOphMuo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0TlySOphMuo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The other big feature shown off in the Split Fiction video are Side Stories, optional one-off adventures that are hidden throughout the game's levels. Discovering one and exploring it will transport players to even more worlds influenced by sci-fi and fantasy fiction, with some of the levels including outer space, an Alice in Wonderland-themed world, and a stage that looks heavily influenced by the recent Dune movies.</p><p>Developed by the studio behind the critically acclaimed It Takes Two, Split Fiction was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-only-split-fiction-is-an-impressive-leap-forward-from-the-makers-of-it-takes-two/1100-6528426/">first revealed at The Game Awards last year</a>. A mandatory two-player game, Split Fiction lets you play as two would-be writers: Mio and Zoe. After the pair sign up to participate in a new publishing program, they find themselves transported to virtual recreations of their stories by a shady tech company and have to work together to escape before they lose their memories.</p><p>Split Fiction is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on March 6, 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/preorders-for-it-takes-two-developers-new-game-split-fiction-now-live/1100-6528489/">and preorders are now live for it</a>. The great thing about the game is that it comes with a cross-play Friend Pass, allowing one user to invite a friend to join them even if they haven't purchased Split Fiction.</p><p>Thanks to its cross-play design, it also doesn't matter which of the three applicable platforms your pal is on either, as you'll both be able to team up for a jaunt across futuristic and magical lands. 2025 has quite a few exciting co-op games on the horizon, and if you're interested in seeing what else is coming out in this genre throughout the year, you can check out GameSpot's list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-most-anticipated-co-op-games-of-2025-and-beyond/2900-6144/" data-ref-id="2900-6144">most-anticipated co-op games of the year</a>.</p>

                <p>Sega recently filed trademarks for Skies of Arcadia and Eternal Arcadia, leaving fans hopeful that some sort of remaster or new entry in the Skies of Arcadia RPG series.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/sega-trademarks-skies-of-arcadia-eternal-arcadia-in-japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the two trademarks were filed on January 16 and made public on January 24. Skies of Arcadia, known as Eternal Arcadia in Japan, was a critically acclaimed RPG from Sega that launched in 2000 for the Dreamcast. It was later ported over to the Nintendo GameCube in 2002 as Skies of Arcadia Legends.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skies-of-arcadia/" data-ref-id="5000-891">Skies of Arcadia</a> follows Vyse, Aika, and Fina, who are part of a group of air pirates called the Blue Rogues as they resist against the tyrannical Valuan Empire. Additional ports of Skies of Arcadia have been highly requested by fans throughout the years, although Skies of Arcadia Legends has never been released outside of the GameCube.</p><p>Sega has not confirmed anything new regarding Skies of Arcadia. However, Sega has been on an initiative to revive some of its old franchises. Back in 2023, Sega <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">announced new entries</a> in the Jet Set Radio, Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, Golden Axe, and Streets of Rage franchises.</p><p>Sega is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-virtua-fighter-gets-unexpected-first-look-but-its-not-gameplay/1100-6528672/" data-ref-id="1100-6528672">new Virtua Fighter game</a>. Hopefully, now some sort of Skies of Arcadia revival won't be a pie in the sky dream after all.</p>

                <p>A modding group has released a mod that brings GTA: Vice City content into the GTA 4 engine, despite efforts from publisher Take-Two Interactive to stop them. This project by Revolution Team, called GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition, ported missions, cutscenes, and the world from Vice City into GTA 4's engine and initially required players to own a copy of GTA 4.</p><p>The development team said its YouTube channel was taken offline by Take-Two. That led to the creation of a new channel that houses a launch trailer for the mod, as well as a decision to rework the mod's requirement. Originally, the mod required GTA 4 to play--something that was done to "show respect to the publisher." Now, that requirement has been dropped, and the mod can be downloaded and played as a standalone game. As always, though, you should be careful about what you download online.</p><p>"Our team's channel was deleted by Take-Two Interactive two days before the project's release. A lot of time and effort was invested into its development, including hundreds of hours of streaming," Revolution Team's statement reads on an updated teaser trailer.</p><p>"[The teaser] gained over 100,000 views in less than a day. Unfortunately, it's absolutely impossible to restore it. We were forced to create a new channel, but it's unlikely that this trailer will reach the people who were truly waiting for it. Nevertheless, we're sharing the result of almost two years of hard work."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hqwmq6XT6o" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7hqwmq6XT6o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Just last week, a mod known as Liberty City Preservation Project <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reportedly-kills-another-gta-fan-project/1100-6528845/" data-ref-id="1100-6528845">was taken down after Rockstar contacted its creators</a>. "This isn't a DMCA, rather a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved. There is no negativity between us and Rockstar Games/Take-Two Interactive," the Liberty City Preservation Project said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/">GTA 6 is still set to release this year</a>.

                <p>The challenging times at Ubisoft continue, as the French gaming company has announced it is closing one studio and downsizing others in the firm's latest round of cost-cutting that will see about 185 people lose their jobs. Ubisoft underwent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">multiple waves of layoffs in 2024 as well.</a></p><p>Ubisoft has confirmed that it is closing Ubisoft Leamington, a support studio that contributed to titles like Star Wars Outlaws and Far Cry 5. The team created the DJ Hero series for Activision before being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-buys-guitar-hero-live-dj-hero-dev-from-act/1100-6447034/" data-ref-id="1100-6447034">acquired by Ubisoft in 2017.</a></p><p>A spokesperson for Ubisoft told GameSpot that is is closing Ubisoft Leamington as part of the company's ongoing mission to "prioritize projects and reduce costs." In addition to closing Ubisoft Leamington, Ubisoft is undergoing "targeted restructurings" of Ubisoft Dusseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p><p>"Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition," Ubisoft said.</p><p>This dramatic action wasn't totally unexpected, as Ubisoft said in a memo to investors in early January that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">continuing to look for ways to "drive significant cost reductions" in the business.</a> Ubisoft added that it will take a "highly selective approach to investments" during this period. In total, Ubisoft said it expects to see a reduction of €200 million ($206 million USD) as part of this plan.</p><p>This is all happening amid reports that have suggested Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">may be working with Tencent on some kind of business arrangement</a> to solidify its future. During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/" data-ref-id="1100-6528718">conference call</a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value.</p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Ubisoft will releases its latest earnings report on February 13, at which time the company may share additional information about its future outlook. The company <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enters a "quiet period" beginning January 29</a>, so no one should expect Ubisoft to make specific announcements about its future business outlook between January 29 and February 13.</p>
