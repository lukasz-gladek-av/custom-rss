                <p>In 2020, Ubisoft chief creative officer Serge Hascoët and vice president of editorial and creative services Tommy François <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-senior-ubisoft-executives-step-down-follo/1100-6479604/" data-ref-id="1100-6479604">stepped down from the company following abuse allegations</a>. Francois and Hascoet were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/police-arrest-former-ubisoft-bosses-over-sexual-misconduct-complaints/1100-6518168/" data-ref-id="1100-6518168">arrested three years later</a> following an investigation by French authorities. Now, the trial is over and Francois and Hascoet have both been convicted alongside another former Ubisoft executive, former games director Guillaume Patrux.</p><p>All three men were sentenced to suspended prison terms for their roles in "enabling a culture of sexual and psychological harassment," as reported by <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/french-court-convicts-ex-ubisoft-bosses-for-workplace-harassment/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Courthouse News Service</a>. Francois was also convicted of attempted sexual assault and given a three-year suspended sentence. During the trial, it was reported that Francois sexually harassed female and male employees, including attempts to grope their genitals.</p><p>Hascoet was handed a shorter suspended sentence of 18-months, while Patrux was given a 12-month suspended sentence for personally bullying members of his team. All three men were also ordered to pay fines, including a 45,000 euro fee for Hascoet, 30,000 euros for Francois, and 10,000 euros for Patrux.</p><p>Although the trio are no longer Ubisoft employees, the company has struggled in the last few years. The company's French workers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-workers-in-france-urged-to-strike-over-return-to-office-mandate/1100-6526740/" data-ref-id="1100-6526740">rebelled over a return-to-office order</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-responds-to-accusations-of-abuse-at-assassins-creed-shadows-support-studio/1100-6528695/" data-ref-id="1100-6528695">allegations of abuse emerged at one of Ubisoft's support studios</a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">Ubisoft formed a partnership with Tencent</a> to guide three of the company's top franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">delayed multiple games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-not-coming-this-summer-company-says/1100-6532062/" data-ref-id="1100-6532062">will not host Ubisoft Forward</a> this summer.</p>
