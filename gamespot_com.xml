                <p>Assassin's Creed games usually include a large open world, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is no exception. While there are familiar elements to the travel and exploration abilities in this game, Shadows is also going to allow its two leading characters, Naoe and Yasuke, to take some time to appreciate the beauty of nature by creating art.</p><p>Ubisoft unveiled this feature during an <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/4GKS1MvpHS3f7ebKWfxHmt/assassins-creed-shadows-exploration-gameplay-overview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended explanation</a> about how the game's exploration mechanics will work. Letting Naoe or Yasuke create art may not give them an edge in battle, but it's an activity that they find rewarding.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8H1SNkcEU9Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8H1SNkcEU9Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yasuke and Naoe will also have their own character-specific activities that they can do outside of quests and missions. For example, Yasuke can find experts who can teach him more about how to use his Kata, which gives his character special attack movies. On the other hand, Naoe's Kuji-kiri meditation will open up more of her backstory.</p><p>Ubisoft has placed a great deal of importance on scouts in this game, as the recruits can help Naoe and Yasuke find places of importance in the game's world without having to transverse every step on their own. Scouts can also raid enemy strongholds one-at-a-time, and so subtly that their marks may not realize what's happening until it's too late. With the resources from scout raids, Naoe or Yasuke can customize their safe houses. Additionally, scouts can help the players cancel provisional alerts if either character has been caught breaking the law.</p><p>Viewpoints are also making a return in Shadows, with some modifications. Player characters can now spot and discover distant locations by getting on a high building and using the 360-degree observe function, which will mark special locations on your map.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zp0v_S61cAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zp0v_S61cAY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As before, viewpoints will open up fast-travel points as well. However, not every fast travel point is safe to go to. Some of them are in enemy-controlled land, and you'll have a major fight on your hands if the enemies discover that your characters have dropped by unannounced.</p><p>If players need a clearer idea about where they are going, the pathfinder feature can be used on horseback. It's not unlike the tools used in Grand Theft Auto games to keep your characters on the right track to their intended destination.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OXycOtXBNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OXycOtXBNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A recent rumor suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-assassins-creed-games-may-come-to-switch-2-report/1100-6528782/" data-ref-id="1100-6528782">Assassin's Creed Shadows will come to Switch 2</a>, but it remains unconfirmed for now. Assassin's Creed Shadows was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">also recently delayed again</a>. The new release date is March 20, and it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

For a limited time, you can get Amazon's first full-color e-ink tablet for $230, down from $280. The Prime-exclusive discount gets even better if you have an eligible trade-in device. If you trade-in an old device--it doesn't need to be a Kindle--you'll save an additional 20%.</p><p>If you want to take notes on your Kindle, Amazon has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;th=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preowned Kindle Scribe ereaders in like-new condition for as low as $234</a>.

If you enjoy saving passages in books, the Colorsoft has the added benefit of letting you highlight text in color, making it easier than ever to organize important sentences you want to return to later.</p><p>Other notable features of the Colorsoft include support for wireless charging, no ads on the lock screen, and 32GB of storage. If you like reading by the pool or relaxing in the bath, the Colorsoft ereader is waterproof and carries an IPX8 water resistance rating, which means it can be fully submerged in water at a depth of 6.5 feet for up to 60 minutes.</p><p>The biggest reason to pick up the Colorsoft is if you’re interested in making the jump to digital comic books and graphic novels. Its color display is leagues better for the format than black and white ereaders like the standard Kindle--and at $230, it’s easier to recommend.</p></div>                      </div><p>As mentioned, you can save even more with an eligible trade-in item. You'll automatically save an additional 20%, even if you send Amazon a cheap device like a Fire Stick. The 20% is calculated from the sale price, so in this case, <strong>you'll save an extra $46 simply for trading in any eligible device</strong>. At the moment, that means the Colorsoft's price drops to $184.</p><p>The $184 price doesn't account for the value of the device you choose to send to Amazon. A Fire Stick is only worth a few bucks, but higher-end devices can be worth significantly more. The Kindle Scribe 16GB model, for example, is worth $85.</p><div title="[Various] Kindle Scribe Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2480" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Kindle Scribe Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite\/dp\/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Like-New Kindle Scribe</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite\/dp\/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20">16GB - $234 (was $310) | 32GB - $260 (was $325)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-New-Amazon-digital-notebook-Paperwhite/dp/B09W8KQ782?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Scribe</a>, the hybrid ereader and note-taking e-ink tablet is also on sale right now.

                <p dir="ltr">Mob Entertainment--the development studio behind the jumpscare-heavy survival horror game known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/poppy-playtime/">Poppy Playtime</a>--is suing Google over what it calls "scam" games that are ripping off the studio's intellectual property (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/510282/poppy-playtime-lawsuit-scam-games-google" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">The studio filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/816640114/Poppy-Playtime-lawsuit-via-Polygon" rel="nofollow ">the lawsuit</a> earlier this week, claiming that Google has allowed a number of illegal knockoff versions of Poppy Playtime into the Google Play store. Among the unofficial (and unauthorized) games are Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, neither of which were created by Mob Entertainment. Both games--developed by an entity known as Daigo--are still available for download on the Google Play store at the time of writing.</p><p dir="ltr">These two games are proving especially vexing for Poppy Playtime's creators due to the fact that the game is episodic in nature. Mob Entertainment argues that by allowing illegitimate games to use "Poppy Playtime" in their titles and (indicate that said games are new episodes), Google is allowing other entities to profit from the Poppy Playtime brand by fooling fans into thinking they're playing new chapters of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">These knockoff games aren't just capitalizing on the Poppy Playtime name, however. Mob Entertainment alleges that the developers of these games are illegally using screenshots from Poppy Playtime 2, presenting them as though they're screenshots of gameplay from the fake games instead.</p><p dir="ltr">The Poppy Playtime developer says that the fault lies with Google due to its failure to take action by removing the knockoff games from its digital app storefront. Mob Entertainment said it has issued multiple DMCA takedown requests and has contacted Google directly with regard to the fake versions of Chapter 3 and Chapter 4. The lawsuit says that although Google did remove both of the fake chapters from its app store sometime in December, both games reappeared on the Google Play store in a matter of days, and Google has allegedly taken no further action against the creators of the illegitimate titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio claims in the lawsuit that the knockoff games--which feature "many grammatical mistakes" and an unappealing color scheme, among other flaws--have "tarnished" Mob Entertainment's reputation, especially given the fact that Daigo's knockoff titles can fool some users--particularly children--into spending exorbitant amounts of money on a game that isn't genuine. On top of that, the lawsuit states that Google is profiting from the scam, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"Google and Daigo's unauthorized applications use Mob Entertainment's trademarks and copyrighted material to trick consumers into spending up to $95 for a game prior to its release on Google Play," Mob Entertainment asserts. "Google receives 15% or 30% of all sales made by the unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 3 or unauthorized Poppy Playtime Chapter 4 applications."</p><p dir="ltr">Google has yet to publicly respond to the lawsuit.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 7 arrives on January 21, and as is usually the case with patch notes for Blizzard's ARPG, the list of changes and bug fixes is very, very long.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's latest season, Season of Witchcraft, is all about players concocting new builds to take advantage of a plethora of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/" data-ref-id="1100-6528778">Witchcraft powers, many themed after Diablo 3's Witch Doctor</a>. But even for those who aren't planning on diving into the game's new seasonal mechanics, there are plenty of major updates to the game's base systems and classes that are worth paying attention to.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4Kc7LjVwa8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R4Kc7LjVwa8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">At the top of that list are Runewords. The powerful socketable items are exclusive to owners of Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion, and they are getting some major buffs going into update 2.1. The amount of Offering generated by many Ritual Runes is going up significantly, while the cost of activating Invocation Runes is going down. Invocation Runes that didn't previously have Overflow bonuses will now have one, overall making Runewords even better than before.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to class changes, many will want to know how the Spiritborn is being adjusted, given how it was by far the most popular (and powerful) class in Season 6 thanks to its arrival as part of Vessel of Hatred. A number of bugs granting the Spiritborn some unintended power, like Masterwork Resolve stacking and the Viscous Shield Paragon Board node granting more damage than it was supposed to, have been fixed.</p><p dir="ltr">That certainly brings down the power level of the Spiritborn a bit, but Blizzard is compensating players by buffing many of the class' underused skills. Centipede enjoyers will enjoy the buffs to the The Devourer (which now deals more damage based on a player's Healing Received bonus) and the Centipede primary Spirit Hall, where Centipede skills will now deal 70% poison damage over six seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the other classes, they're all receiving some love. Barbarians will enjoy a massive buff to Hammer of the Ancients and a major change to their Walking Arsenal passive. Meanwhile, the Sorcerer is gaining some significant Paragon Board buffs alongside two new Ball Lightning Unique items to experiment with. Rogues will receive a few buffs to some underperforming Paragon nodes while also receiving buffs to Shadow Clones, and Druid will see big improvements to Shred and its Ultimate skills, like Cataclysm and Shred. Last but not least, Necromancer will benefit from a number of minion updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of minions, the season also brings an overhaul to summoned minions, with Blizzard looking to make the wording of summoning skills and how they interact more consistent across all classes. That means tagging all skills that summon creatures as Summoning skills, having damage done by summons attributed to the player character across the board (and thus allowing summoned units to properly interact with all of a player's damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers), and updating the wording on various skills to be more uniform.</p><p dir="ltr">"Summoning skills have behaved inconsistently across the classes, making it hard to know how to scale their damage or what effects would interact with your summons," Blizzard writes in the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24171214/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>. "This update aims to standardize their interactions across the board by attributing the damage they deal to the player, rather than the summoned unit."</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Diablo 4 Season 7, check out our interview with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4s-armory-will-be-a-boon-for-eternal-players-and-the-chances-of-a-witch-class/1100-6528885/" data-ref-id="1100-6528885">Blizzard on the addition of the Armory</a> and whether or not the game may ever see the addition of a Witch class.

This will include 3 Infernal Compasses and 3 Nightmare Dungeon Sigils.</li></ul></li><li>The overall drop chance of Gem Fragments has been reduced.</li><li>The variance on the roll of a Unique Item's power has been reduced. Additionally, the variance for the strength of the power further reduces for each Greater Affix present.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>It doesn’t feel good to get an item that has multiple Greater Affixes with poorly rolled power. This change will make it so that a 4 GA item will always have a good roll on the Unique power.</em></p><ul><li>The Greater Crafting Whisper Cache has been adjusted.  <ul><li>It’s now a normal cache, so it will appear more often.</li><li>Now contains 4 times as many crafting materials than other caches would drop.</li><li>No longer contains non-crafting items.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Affix Updates</h2><ul><li>Inherent Affixes for Critical Strike Damage on base items has been increased to match the range of Inherent Vulnerable Damage Affixes.</li><li>Items that have affixes that are class specific are no longer class-restricted. Instead, the specific affix is now class-restricted.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Any affixes that are inactive due to being incompatible with your class will be explicitly called out as disabled on item tooltips.</em></p><ul><li><em>Items and affixes that are not usable by your current class will explicitly denote which classes can use them on the tooltip using class iconography.</em></li><li><em>The following list details what affixes are now class restricted or have had the class they are restricted to updated.</em></li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Most of these affixes are from class-specific Tempering recipes.

Many effects still interact only with the class specific version of these Summons.</li><li>Updated wording on various effects to remove "You and your Summons" where it is now redundant to specifically call out your Summons.</li></ul><p>Developer’s Note: <em>Summoning Skills have behaved inconsistently across the Classes, making it hard to know how to scale their damage or what effects would interact with your Summons. This update aims to standardize their interactions across the board by attributing the damage they deal to the player, rather than the Summoned unit. This means that damage from your Summons will be able to trigger all of your Lucky Hit effects, and interact with all of your damage modifiers, multipliers, and triggers. Note that effects such as Ring of Mendeln still properly increase their damage output based on the damage bonuses you have for the specific Minion type that triggered the effect. Additionally, specific changes for Necromancer have been implemented to reflect these changes, which can be seen above in the relevant section.</em></p><h2>Infernal Hordes</h2><ul><li>Infernal Compasses have been updated.</li><li>Compasses now stack, based on tier.
