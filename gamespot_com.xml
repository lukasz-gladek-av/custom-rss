                <p>This week, Activision is launching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> Season 19: Haunted Masquerade, the latest Halloween-themed event for the franchise. This year, Haunted Masquerade is introducing magical masks of their allied heroes that give the characters special buffs and powers. For example, Tracer can wear a Winston mask, and he can wear her mask. The launch trailer below shows off some of those new mask abilities in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIhY9M5dWB4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hIhY9M5dWB4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to the Haunted Masquerade arcade mode, the new season is bringing back Halloween Terror 2025, which will allow four players to team up in co-op to defend Adlersbrunn from Dr. Junkenstein and his monster minions. Your chosen heroes will have to face hordes of foes and "powerful bosses" to maintain control of the castle.</p><p>Additionally, Junkenstein's Revenge lets players control Sojourn, Junker Queen, Kiriko, and Ashe as they crush barricades and battle "exploding zombie omnics," as well as Banshee Moira and Gargoyle Winston, before uncovering Adlersbrunn's castle. The new season is also bringing back Wrath of the Bride as a co-op fight and adding new Mythic cosmetics and other in-game collectibles.</p><p>Stadium is adding three new heroes: Hazard, Sojourn, and Torbjörn. It's also getting a new map, Busan (Control), and other item upgrades. Additionally, the trailer briefly teases a new Overwatch 2 x One-Punch Man collaboration that's coming to the game in the near future.</p><p>Overwatch 2 Season 19: Haunted Masquerade is out now and will continue through December 9.

                <p>D'Angelo, the voice behind one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2/" data-ref-id="5000-458780">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s most memorable moments, has passed away. While tributes pour in from the music industry, D'Angelo is also being remembered by Rockstar Games and the legions of gamers who will never forget his contribution to the RDR2 soundtrack.</p><p>D'Angelo was a pioneer in the neo-soul movement, releasing three studio albums throughout his career--his 1995 debut Brown Sugar, Voodoo in 2000, and Black Messiah, which was released in 2014 after a long break. Gamers might be more familiar with his later single Unshaken, which was recorded for the Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1978209317409955963" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Rest In Peace D'Angelo, a true titan of soul. We are eternally grateful for his track "Unshaken" which will forever be an enduring part of the legacy of Red Dead Redemption 2. <a href="https://t.co/HvmcJ6FPWA" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HvmcJ6FPWA</a></p>  — Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1978209317409955963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>A big fan of the original Red Dead Redemption, D'Angelo ended up playtesting the sequel while it was still in development, after he reached out to a contact at Rockstar. Seeing his enthusiasm for the game, Rockstar invited D'Angelo to contribute to a song for RDR2's soundtrack--a collaboration that eventuated in the single Unshaken.</p><p>Unshaken plays during the gameplay of RDR2, creating a cinematic moment as Arthur Morgan rides his horse back to camp following a pivotal story mission. The soulful song created an unforgettable moment within the game's narrative, and Unshaken has since become the most-streamed song on the RDR2 soundtrack.</p><p>Rockstar paid tribute to the artist on social media following news of his death, and many gamers have followed suit, recounting their memories of hearing D'Angelo's voice while playing RDR2. Fan tributes have proliferated across social media, including the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0AykH20X3Q&amp;list=RDL0AykH20X3Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments</a> of various versions of Unshaken on YouTube.</p><p>D'Angelo died on Tuesday morning at the age of 51, following a private battle with cancer, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/music/news/dangelo-celeberity-tributes-doja-cat-missy-elliott-1236552530/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety reports</a>.</p>
