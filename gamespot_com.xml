                <p>A new rumor points to a potential 2028 release window for the Steam Deck 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The source of the rumor is a post on forum <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-launch-october-16.1687405/page-5#post-270737598" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">NeoGAF</a> from hardware leaker KeplerL2. Within a thread about Steam Deck competitors, a user wondered if the upcoming ROG Xbox Asus Ally would be undercut by new portable PC releases from MSI or Valve. KeplerL2 replied, "Steam Deck 2 is 2028," without further details. Officially, Valve has released no information on the timing or the potential hardware of a Steam Deck follow-up.</p><p dir="ltr">In response to speculation about a revised Steam Deck in 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-wont-release-new-steam-deck-models-yearly-steam-deck-2-will-be-a-generational-leap/1100-6527299/" data-ref-id="1100-6527299">Valve said the next model would be a "generational leap."</a> The original Steam Deck first launched in February 2022 and was followed by a OLED upgrade in November 2023. Valve has continued to support both platforms with new updates and features.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-verified-program-expanding-to-other-hardware-running-steamos-like-legion-go-s/1100-6531502/">Valve expanded its "Steam Deck Verified" program</a> to hardware able to run SteamOS, meaning you can now check if a Steam game will run on your Legion Go S or other portable PC platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The popularity of the Steam Deck has resulted in a horde of competitors. Microsoft is releasing a Steam Deck competitor, via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/">an Xbox-branded version of the ROG Asus Ally</a>. That device will launch on October 16.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> dropped a bunch of new collabs in quick succession this week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-gorillaz-season-in-fortnite-festival/1100-6534219/" data-ref-id="1100-6534219">Gorillaz</a>, the Front Man from Squid Game, and the One Punch Man cosmetics on Tuesday and Wednesday. But apparently Epic isn't done with this week just yet, because the Fortnite Instagram account just teased a new skin based on a space dwarf from the co-op shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483" data-ratio="0.56245662734212" data-width="2882" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558483"></a><figcaption>The Fortnite Instagram posted a story teasing the Deep Rock Galactic collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4558483-deeprockfortnite.jpg"></figure><p>The countdown timer indicates this six-foot-tall dwarf skin will hit the Fortnite item shop on Friday at the usual shop reset time at 5 PM PT. It'll likely have some accessories that come with it, like a pickaxe, back bling, and wrap--though that's not always the case with individual gaming skins like this. The Goat from Goat Simulator, for example, never received any accessories, and Goat Simulator and Deep Rock Galactic share the same publisher. The image above is the entire tease, and so there's no way to tell what else, if anything, might come with it.</p><p>This is a rare example of Fortnite collaborating with another video game that isn't available on the Epic Games Store. It's not something that happens a lot, but it's not particularly shocking either, since Halo just got a slot on the current battle pass despite also not being on EGS.</p><p>Deep Rock Galactic, released in early access on PC and Xbox in 2018 before getting a full release in 2020, is a co-op shooter in which players control their own custom fantasy-style dwarf as they try to mine valuable resources in procedurally generated cave systems on a hostile alien planet. This collaboration is likely pegged to the new spinoff game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-583534">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a>, a chaotic top-down shooter which exits early access in September.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We're a few weeks removed from the Battlefield 6 open beta, and by all accounts, the test was a massive success. While it was live, the beta <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-open-beta-outpaced-grand-theft-auto-5-on-ps5-and-xbox/2900-6921/#1">topped the Steam charts</a> while also placing highly on both Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5's active-user leaderboards. Once it was over, its absence (and some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-get-all-free-battlefield-6-skins-and-rewards-in-battlefield-2042/2900-6887/">freebies</a>) prompted a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-prompted-a-huge-spike-in-battlefield-2042-players-for-an-obvious-reason/1100-6534270/">huge spike in sales</a> of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. The vibes around Battlefield haven't been this good in a while, thanks to that beta.</p><p dir="ltr">Feedback has been coming in quickly since the beta ended, with many fans taking to social media and forums to talk about what they most liked and disliked about this new Battlefield experience. However, there's one particular reaction that I find fascinating, and that's players being happy about the lack of collaborations with outside IP.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116" data-ratio="0.56140350877193" data-width="1197" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4544116"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4544116-battlefield-6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Forniteification," as some call it, has turned other franchises into interactive IP catalogues, tapping into current trends and nostalgic trips to yesteryear in order to sell skins and other cosmetics. Battlefield's biggest competitor, Call of Duty, has embraced the concept, enlisting a range of established faces from WWE wrestlers to Cheech and Chong to Nicki Minaj into its platoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision has since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/">acknowledged fans' criticism</a> that the series has "drifted" from its identity, but I don't know if the company can fully close Pandora's box at this point. Activision may not think so, either: The news that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Black Ops 6 skins will not carry over to Black Ops 7</a> notably does not include the battle royale Warzone, where wacky skins will continue to exist--Activision may be trying to find a way to get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">Then again, we can't use the term "Fortniteification" without mentioning its namesake, as Fortnite is currently enjoying a season headlined by the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. Name a popular IP across movies, TV, video games, or even music thanks to Fortnite Festival, and there's a chance it's been a part of Fortnite at some point. Fortnite's cartoony style may have immunized it from similar criticism, though; for "military simulations" like CoD and Battlefield, there are expectations of realism that fans aren't always willing to compromise on.</p><p dir="ltr">The devs behind Battlefield 6, to their credit, are talking the talk so far; Vince Zampella recently spoke to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-leads-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins-to-stray-true-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, where he said that BF6 will "stay true to Battlefield" with cosmetics that stick to what the article calls the "core visual identity of Battlefield." Online forums like Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1mf53ev/battlefield_6_leads_will_avoid_goofy_crossover/" rel="nofollow">seem to be happy</a> with this, with one commenter saying they hope this declaration is "not an empty promise."</p><p dir="ltr">Look, I appreciate those who want Battlefield to be as "authentic" an experience as possible for its fans--whatever that even means. However, it would be completely naive to think that Battlefield won't try its hand at the collaboration game, simply because Electronic Arts likes money and wants to earn as much of it as possible. The main reason those wacky Call of Duty skins appear in the game in the first place is because Activision knows people will buy them, and EA would be silly to leave those potential dollars on the table.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4558499"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty's recent Beavis and Butthead collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4558499-beavis.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Please don't misunderstand me: I am not saying that a Battlefield where Ronald McDonald and the Burger King finally settle their score is inevitable (though if Fortnite wanted to take on this hypotheticalâ€¦). What I am saying, though, is that expecting Battlefield 6 to maintain this lack of collaboration throughout its life cycle is setting yourself up for disappointment, because there's simply too much money to be made in those partnerships.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, there are ways to make the inevitable collaborations with outside IP blend in seamlessly with Battlefield's look and feel; namely, choose partners that are a natural fit for a military simulation sort of game. They're out there, and I'm willing to bet the IP owners would be thrilled to join Battlefield 6 if the game mirrors the success it saw in open beta when it fully launches in October.</p><p dir="ltr">Take <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, for example. This one doesn't have to go too far--armor skins, perhaps a weapon or two--but the defenders of democracy in Helldivers 2 would make a nice fit into Battlefield 6, even with their futuristic look. Another one that sticks out to me is <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong>, as I'm sure many Battlefield players who are also MGS fans would love being able to have the official Foxhound logo, or Snake's bandana, or any of Big Boss's many camouflage patterns from MGS 3 on their character. Let's not forget that Battlefield 2042 included <strong>Mass Effect</strong> and <strong>Dead Space</strong> collabs, so EA could always dip into that well again too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's fertile ground for partnerships outside of video game IP as well. <strong>Reacher</strong> on Amazon Prime comes to mind; if Alan Ritchson wanted to record some lines and lend his likeness to a Battlefield version of Jack Reacher, that would fit nicely. EA could even go for a nostalgia hit with another fictional Jack in <strong>24</strong>'s Bauer, especially if Kiefer Sutherland would lend his voice and likeness as well.</p><p dir="ltr">These are off-the-cuff ideas, but the overall theme remains consistent; with some restraint, Battlefield 6 could jump into the Scrooge McDuck money bin that is outside IP collaboration, but do it in a way that "stays true to Battlefield" as Zampella suggests is the plan. Partnering with other IP owners doesn't mean you immediately have to throw Pennywise the Clown into your game; by being selective, EA has an opportunity to walk the fine line and get outside IPs into Battlefield 6 without driving it into becoming a parody of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I just hope the BF6 teams at DICE and the other studios can figure it out, because if I had to guess, the challenge is going to come to them eventually. There's simply too much money to be made for EA to ignore.</p>
