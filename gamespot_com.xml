                <p>Take-Two Interactive plans to have a comfortable gap between the upcoming releases of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> and Borderlands 4, even though both games are currently scheduled to launch within its 2026 financial year.

While the Borderlands live-action movie was released to poor reception in August, Zelnick doesn't foresee it having a negative impact on the Borderlands game franchise ahead of its new mainline entry release. "So, I don't think it hurt at all, if anything I think it may have helped a little bit. It does highlight something that I've spoken about many times which is the difficulty of bringing our intellectual property to another medium," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-was-disappointing-but-didnt-hurt-at-all" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelnick said to IGN</a>.</p><p>Once again developed by Gearbox, Borderlands 4 was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> in August, although details on the game have been kept tightly locked up since then.

                <p>Seven years ago, composer Yasuaki Iwata left his mark on Nintendo history with the riveting score for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/1900-6416626/" data-ref-id="1900-6416626">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, which he co-wrote with Manaka Kataoka and Hajime Wakai. But now, Iwata has revealed that his time at Nintendo has come to an end.</p><p>In a message posted on his X account, Iwata said that he left Nintendo in July 2023. He also profusely thanked his supporters and the players who enjoyed his work at Nintendo over the years. Additionally, Iwata stated that he's been working on new projects since he left Nintendo, but he didn't elaborate on what they are.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/yasui_wata/status/1853634520362389547" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I have a bit of a belated announcement to share. <br>In July of last year, I took a step in a new direction by leaving my position at Nintendo. <br>I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported me over the years, to those who enjoyed my work, and to everyone…</p>  — Yasuaki Iwata / 岩田恭明(いわた やすあき) (@yasui_wata) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasui_wata/status/1853634520362389547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Yasuaki Iwata joined Nintendo in 2013, and he worked on wide variety of titles during his 10-year stint at the company. He composed the opening theme for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-island-getaway/1900-6417431/" data-ref-id="1900-6417431">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, as well as other music for the game. His first credit for Nintendo was Super Mario 3D World, and he went on to contribute music to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-8/1900-6415760/" data-ref-id="1900-6415760">Mario Kart 8</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arms-review/1900-6416696/" data-ref-id="1900-6416696">Arms</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-me-and-you-and-ev/1900-6417051/" data-ref-id="1900-6417051">Super Smash Bros.

The music from Breath of the Wild, however, may be his biggest legacy at Nintendo.</p><p>Any video game publisher would be lucky to have Iwata as part of their team, but he didn't state whether his next project is game-related or if he's pursuing a solo project outside of the gaming industry.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Activision launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-could-be-cods-missing-link/1100-6521961/" data-ref-id="1100-6521961">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</a>, the latest addition to the franchise's successful push into mobile gaming. However Warzone Mobile is already going to be losing support on older mobile devices starting later this month.</p><p>On November 14, Warzone Mobile's minimum specs will require iOS 17 or Android 13 or higher, as well as a GPU capable of bindless texturing. After that date, devices that can't meet those requirements will no longer receive updates or get access to the game's latest Season 1 content.</p><p>Users with older devices will still be able to play Warzone Mobile as long as version 3.10 has been downloaded and installed ahead of November 14. Unfortunately, this is a temporary reprieve. Activision's grace period will only extend six months before the revised minimum specs will be enforced for players who are still on the previous version of the game. The company also noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call of Duty Mobile</a> will be offering special rewards for players whose devices are no longer compatible with Warzone Mobile.

The first game produced by Hideo Kojima and his studio after he left Konami, Death Stranding was released five years ago on PS4 and would be followed by PC and iOS ports in 202 and 2023, respectively. As a launch special, publisher 505 Games is offering Death Stranding at a 50% discount on Xbox.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the director's cut edition, which added enhanced graphical options, gameplay changes, and new content on top of the original game. Set in a world where humanity had barely survived an extinction-level event, Death Stranding follows Sam Porter Bridges on a post-apocalyptic trek as he explores the USA and works to reconnect its various cities.</p><p dir="ltr">The game also featured a star-studded cast, with many of the characters not only being voiced by famous faces but also adopting their likenesses for Death Stranding. Bridges was played by Norman Reedus, and other roles were filled by Lea Seydoux, Mads Mikkelsen, Troy Baker, Guillermo del Toro, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the face of all of Death Stranding's violence, its dead things, its surreal horror, and the bleakest, salted-earth portrayal of the post-apocalypse, there has always been this strong mote of hope and love and bonding and connection that's never been more necessary," Justin Clark wrote in GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746"> Death Stranding: Director's Cut review</a>. "If nothing else, Death Stranding: Director's Cut is the best excuse to return to the valley of the shadow of death, and find the grim beauty waiting there. What the new features and content bring to the table is simply making that return easier and more welcoming than ever."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/" data-ref-id="1100-6509825">A sequel was officially revealed in 2022</a> after months of teases, and while<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214"> Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> doesn't have an exact release date yet, it does look like it'll be a wild follow-up to the original.
