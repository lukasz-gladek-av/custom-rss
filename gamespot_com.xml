This is the first time that Ubisoft is not holding a showcase since it began hosting them in 2020, and it'll instead have a presence at events like Summer Game Fest and the PC Gaming Show.</p><p>"We are always eager to connect with our players and showcase our games," a Ubisoft representative said to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lqqfmg47ok2z" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>.

  </div><p>It's not too surprising to hear that Ubisoft won't have a dedicated showcase, as it recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">that it had delayed multiple upcoming games</a>. The company didn't name any of them specifically when it dropped this news during its latest earnings report, but it mentioned that some of its "biggest productions" are affected.</p><p>Ubisoft did reveal a rough timeline for when players will see "significant content coming from our largest brands" and it looks like new releases will roll out during its 2026-2027 financial years--April 1, 2026 to March 31, 2027--including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/" data-ref-id="1100-6531547">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake</a> by March 2026.</p><p>As part of its cost-cutting efforts during a challenging 2025, Ubsioft made a major change to its organization. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">The company created a new dedicated subsidiary</a> to focus on its Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six franchises, with Tencent investing $1.25 billion USD in a minority stake in this new initiative. There have also been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/">mass layoffs and studio closures</a> at Ubisoft, resulting in 185 people losing their jobs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/">and the shutdown of XDefiant earlier this year</a>.</p>

The update adds a new questline, new recipes, rare fish to collect and display in your C.A.M.P., and of course, a chill new pastime that can be enjoyed anywhere across the map.</p><p>Fishing can be unlocked through the new Casting Off questline, which can be accessed through a new location in the Mire known as Fisherman's Rest. The questline will give players the base-level fishing rod, which can then be upgraded through Tinker's Workbench.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fallout 76 Season 21 Gone Fission Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The fishing rod isn't an item that needs to be manually equipped; instead, just go up to any body of water and select the "Fish" command when it shows up on screen. Fishing isn't contained to just the new area. You can fish anywhere across the map with a handy mantra: If you can swim in it, you can fish in it.</p><p>There are a number of fish to be caught in Fallout 76, from generic fish to regional fish that have differing levels of rarity from common to super rare. The rarest catch is a super-cute axolotl--there are twelve of them to be caught, with one unique axolotl available to be caught every month.</p><p>You'll have to upgrade both your bait and your rod to have a chance at catching rarer fish, and the weather will play a part in what you can catch, too. Fish you catch can be eaten as is, broken down into Fish Bits that can be used in recipes, or saved and displayed in your C.A.M.P. with a new fish-display item.</p><p>The Gone Fission season also adds a heap of new fishing-related items.

Creators will be able to build custom assets like bridges, houses, animatable props, and static meshes, and also customize individual elements using a color picker from a selection of 42 production-specific colors matching actual Lego bricks.</p><p>Epic and the Lego Group have also confirmed that the feature will be expanded over time with more bricks and capabilities.</p><p>Then there's Lego Bloom Tycoon, which offers five new galleries and 200 new assets that will allow creators to build an assortment of game ideas from a collection of props, gameplay pieces, animals, and more.</p><p>"Our goal is to give creators a deeper level of customization and control, and these features significantly expand the creative toolkit for building Lego islands," Epic Games said in a <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/introducing-the-lego-brick-editor-and-lego-bloom-tycoon-template-for-fortnite-creators?team=personal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.

                <p>Building a gaming PC is kind of like building a hot rod--sure, the parts that make the car go fast are important, but if you're going to spend all that time on it, shouldn't it look cool, too? As such, PC gamers who build their own systems love to look for the PC case that fits their aesthetic. Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan, is where PC case-makers go to show off the chassis they'll be selling throughout the year. Some are purely cosmetic, while others put function over form, but many are fascinating. It's important to note that, due to the international trade situation caused by U.S. tariffs, the availability of some new computing items is in question. That said, here are some of the cases we loved from the show.</p><h3>Hyte X50 Air</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNMBD7S3AGk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jNMBD7S3AGk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hyte has become a prominent name in PC cases in the last couple of years, and the <a href="https://hyte.com/events/computex?utm_campaign=computex2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X50 Air</a> makes it easy to see why. With its rounded edges and unique color options--lavender, matcha, pink, and red to go with the standard black and white variants--the design language calls to mind the iMacs of yore.</p><p>In the interview with Gamers Nexus in the video above, HYTE Product Director Rob Teller explains just how hard it is to put an airflow-friendly mesh onto a curved surface, as they've done with this case. He shows off a variety of failed test models, including one with metal so soft that it began to rust in a week and another where the edge of the mesh acted more like a "tear here" perforation line. The end product, though, is a truly unique-looking case with gentle curves inside and out.</p><p>This case isn't available quite yet, but HYTE has a bunch of other great cases already on the market, such as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DKW889MJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyte Y70</a>, which offers a number of fun colorways, including the pink one pictured below, but with fewer curves. This one retails for $239.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499266,1300-4499267,1300-4499268,1300-4499269,1300-4499270,1300-4499271" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499266-hyte-x50-blk-1-converted.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499267-hyte-x50-matcha-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499268-hyte-x50-pink-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499269-hyte-x50-red-4-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499270-hyte-x50-taro-5-converted.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4499271-hyte-x50-white-4-converted.jpeg"></figure><h3>Silverstone FLP02</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Kmo8RPrmo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z5Kmo8RPrmo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The case makes for an interesting blend of retro aesthetics with modern adaptations. The inside of the case is spacious enough to fit beefy GPUs and AIO coolers up to 360mm. The front of the case features one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A ports, and a combo audio jack hidden under a magnetic flap, as well.</p><p>But it also makes use of standard features seen on those old PC cases. There's a working lock on the front of the case that locks the power button. The Turbo button, used to overclock old CPUs back in the PC stone age, will now allow you to manually crank up your fan speed. The front of the case also has space for three 5.25-inch drives. The floppy disk-style dummy pieces can be left in place if you're one of the 99% of PC gamers who hasn't used an optical drive in more than a decade (not scientifically verified), but you can indeed slot 5.25-inch optical drives into those spots, if you like.</p><p>The original ultra-retro FLP01 was a very popular case for Silverstone, and the company <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/pc-cases/silverstone-reveals-the-flp02-late-80s-style-tower-pc-case-proudly-beige-but-thoroughly-modern-inside" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Tom's Hardware</a> that it plans to make a lot of these cases to keep up with demand. The FLP02 will retail later this year for $220 in the U.S. If you're looking for another retro case, there isn't really anything like it on the market except for SilverStone's FLP01, which the company has a hard time keeping in stock. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-Technology-All-Metal-Radiator-SST-FA514X-WG/dp/B0D9PQ35CF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SilverStone FARA 514X</a>, priced at $129, is another ATX mid-tower-sized case with plenty of room and a more modern design.</p><h3>Cooler Master MasterFrame 360 Panoramic</h3><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHwd-PQbRjg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="466">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MHwd-PQbRjg?start=466" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PC builders are no strangers to building aesthetically-appealing PCs, as cases have featured tempered glass panels for decades, but recent innovations have brought us things like fish-tank-style cases and curved glass corners to really show things off. If you're <em>really</em> confident in your building skills, though, you can show off to the world with Cooler Master's MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, which offers a continuous view into your PC case from the front and both sides. You'll have to manage your cables carefully if you want to make the best use of this chassis.</p><p>There's also a variant of the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, called the AK Mods X Bounce, that puts a stage on the front of the case, backed by an LCD screen. The idea with this variant is to let you put something there--Batman, Sephiroth, Hello Kitty, or whatever your favorite action figure is--and then give it an animated background to stand in front of. We're expecting lots of cool mods to come out of this particular option. Cooler Master has not yet revealed availability or price, however.</p><p>It seems we'll be waiting a bit for the MasterFrame 360 Panoramic, but <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cooler-Master-MasterFrame-Open-Air-Panoramic/dp/B08T5PRCCN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cooler Master's MasterFrame 700</a> will do an equally good job of putting your PC on display to admire, albeit without the curved glass. We're betting it's less expensive than the 360 Panoramic, too, at $191.</p>
