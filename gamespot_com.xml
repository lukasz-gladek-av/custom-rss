                <p>IO Interactive has announced "key partners" for its upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a>, and they include a series of well-known global brands. In a statement on social media, the studio said it's partnered with Aston Martin, Coca-Cola, Orlebar Brown, HermanMillerGaming, Jaguar, Range Rover Defender, Omega, Nvidia, and Leica.</p><p>The James Bond movie series is known for its product placement, and 007: First Light will have some, too. The reveal trailer showed an Aston Martin DBS and some flashy Omega watches. A Triumph motorcycle was in the trailer, too, but Triumph is not listed as a partner. A Range Rover Defender was in the trailer, too. Walther, the gun company that makes Bond's iconic PPK, is not listed as a partner.</p><p>The financial terms of the deals to include these brands in First Light are unknown. Revenue from product placement in the Bond movies is substantial, coming in at <a href="https://theweek.com/articles/485031/james-bonds-recordshattering-product-placement-by-numbers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported millions of dollars.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755" data-ratio="0.52256770310933" data-width="997" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510755"></a><figcaption>A scene from the First Light trailer showing a case of Omega watches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4510755-screenshot2025-06-10at1.39.07pm.png"></figure><p>First Light launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC. It tells an origin story for James Bond, focusing on a 26-year-old Bond who joins MI6 and rises through the ranks to earn his 00 status. We don't know who's playing Bond in the game, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/who-plays-james-bond-in-007-first-light-fans-believe-theyve-worked-it-out/1100-6532125/" data-ref-id="1100-6532125">fans believe they have worked it out.</a></p><p>IO has high hopes for the game, as the studio has said it aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">create a trilogy of games. </a>While fans have to wait to play First Light, IO's Hitman game just added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen's LeChiffre from Casino Royale as its latest elusive target.</a></p><p>As for the James Bond movie series, a 24th film is in the works now, with Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on to produce. As of yet, however, there is no word on who will direct or, crucially, who will play Bond himself. Series stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">no longer involved with the creative decisions for the James Bond series. </a></p>

                <p>It's a big day for Rainbow Six Siege, as the game's "largest and most transformative" update in the game's 10-year history is out now, free for everyone on all platforms.</p><p>The update, Siege X, includes a new onboarding experience to help newcomers familiarize themselves with the game. It also introduces improved graphics and sound designs, along with updated features like new destructible items such as gas pipes and fire extinguishers. The Siege X update also "modernizes" the Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe maps with new lighting, shadows, and resolution updates, with Ubisoft planning these "modernization" updates for three 5v5 maps with each new season going ahead.</p><p>What's more, Siege X adds the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dual-front-brings-fast-paced-6v6-action-to-rainbow-six-siege/1100-6530104/" data-ref-id="1100-6530104">Dual Front 6v6 mode</a>, which is a respawning mode that challenges players to seize enemy territories. It is available only for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI9fgQY0d5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Beyond this, the game gets an anti-cheat boost with the introduction of R6 ShieldGuard, which is described as a "multifaceted approach to anti-cheat."</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege and the Siege X update are available for free, but players have to pay to unlock things like additional operators and Ranked playlists. Players can alternatively buy the Elite edition ($20) or the Ultimate edition ($40) to get access to even more content.</p><p>All of this is arriving alongside the newest seasonal update, Operation Daybreak, the centerpiece of which is a remaster for the operator Clash. The soldier's CCE shield is now deployable, meaning she can place it strategically. The Operation Daybreak season also makes balance changes, including electricity no longer dealing damage and limb damage being reduced. The Jackal, Sledge, Thunderbird, JÃ¤ger, and Blackbeard operators have all received balance updates, too.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege originally launched in 2015 and has been steadily supported and evolved over time with consistent updates. It's reached 85 million players prior to the Siege X update.</p>

                <p>To celebrate Pride Month, publisher Devolver Digital has <a href="https://merch.devolverdigital.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released a new line of merch</a>, including shirts, stickers, and other items.

In addition to its hotline, Trans Lifeline runs a microgrant program that provides support for gender-affirming care, defrays legal costs for incarcerated trans people, and assists trans migrants in navigating immigration systems.</p><p>The organization has long operated on a very restricted budget, relying primarily on individual donations of both money and volunteer hours and employing only a small staff. Trans Lifeline has become increasingly crucial as a provider of nationwide resources for LGBTQ communities, as the US federal government has taken steps to eliminate federal support programs and <a href="https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/lgbtq/federal-government-plans-to-cut-funding-for-crisis-lifelines-lgbtq-youth-services" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cease federal funding for organizations that provide LGBTQ-focused services</a>.</p><p>In addition to Devolver, many members of the gaming community have lately been active in bringing awareness to the vital role that LGBTQ charities like Trans Lifeline play today. For instance, Magic: The Gathering YouTubers have <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/magic-the-gathering/trans-lifeline-giveaway-tolarian-community-college-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">helped raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for Trans Lifeline</a> this year.</p>
