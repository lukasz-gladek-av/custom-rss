                <p>As a part of today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State Of Play livestream</a>, Digital Eclipse and NetherRealm Studios have announced the Mortal Kombat Legacy Kollection, a collection of classic Mortal Kombat games from across the series' arcade, handheld, and console titles.</p><p>The collection includes several games from Mortal Kombat's history, including Mortal Kombat, Mortal Kombat II, Mortal Kombat III, and Mortal Kombat IV. The trailer stated it will include additional titles as well, though the studios have yet to clarify what games that might entrail. Here are the games currently included in the collection:</p><ul><li>Mortal Kombat – 1992: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, Game Gear</li><li>Mortal Kombat II -1993: Arcade, SNES, Genesis, Game Boy, 32X</li><li>Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES, Genesis</li><li>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 – 1995: Arcade, SNES</li><li>Mortal Kombat 4 – 1997: Arcade</li><li>Mortal Kombat Advance – 2001: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance – 2002: Game Boy Advance</li><li>Mortal Kombat: Tournament Edition – 2003: Game Boy Advance</li></ul><p>Each game will feature modern enhancements as well as online play thanks to the inclusion of rollback netcode. On the official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/mortal-kombat-legacy-collection-launches-on-ps5-ps4-this-year/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, Sony confirmed that the collection will give players "open access to everything in these games without need for hidden codes or memorization." However, how exactly this will be implemented is "still a secret." Sony stated that fans can look forward to hearing a bit more about the Legacy Kollection ahead of its release later this year.</p><p>The announcement comes after NetherRealm Studios stated that the most recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-devs-respond-to-calls-for-more-dlc/1100-6531826/" data-ref-id="1100-6531826">Mortal Kombat 1, would no longer be in active development</a> after the release of the Definitive Edition last month. Mortal Kombat 1 served as a soft reboot for the franchise, with the in-game universe under the direction of Liu Kang instead of Raiden. Guest characters added via DLC included Invincible's Omni-Man, Scream's Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian.</p>

                <p>Announced during the February State of Play earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> reappeared during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">June State of Play</a>. The new trailer offered a more detailed look at the RPG's story as well as a release date: October 3.</p><p>Time Stranger is the next game in a Digimon RPG series that dates back to 2006 on the Nintendo DS. As the title implies, this new game puts you into the role of a time traveler who has mysteriously been sent back in time eight years, just before a devastating disaster--it seems it's up to you to ensure it doesn't happen, as well as investigate other timeline anomalies. Like the past games, you'll also collect and train Digimon partners, which you'll command in turn-based encounters against enemy Digimon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVvDc7_w5ZY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IVvDc7_w5ZY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The story will take place in both the real and digital worlds, and you'll be able to recruit and train over 450 different digital monsters. As seen in the new trailer, each Digimon has a wealth of options when it comes to customization, too. The full depth of options available is still unclear, but it looks like Time Stranger is shaping up to be an ideal game for folks who want to really dive into the minutia of turn-based combat.</p><p>Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p>

A free demo is launching today on the PlayStation Store. The full game is set for release in early 2026 on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Fans have been waiting some time for another Nioh game, as Nioh 2 was released in 2020. It scored strong reviews and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/02/nioh-2-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shipped more than 2.5 million copies.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXGm-JaxY54" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KXGm-JaxY54" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are two fighting styles in Nioh 3, and they are are Samurai and Ninja. Below is how Team Ninja describes each.</p><h3><strong>Samurai: </strong></h3><p>"The Samurai style provides a gameplay experience similar to previous Nioh titles. New actions such as Arts Proficiency, which enhances the power of martial arts, and Deflect, which allows players to block enemy attacks at the last moment have been added, helping create a series of intense and deadly face-to-face confrontations."</p><h3><strong>Ninja:</strong></h3><p>"The Ninja style excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions, giving ninjas the advantage of being able to attack from outside of the enemy’s range by utilizing a variety of 'Ninjitsu' techniques according to the situation on the battlefield. Players have the ability to use techniques like Mist, which leaves a clone after an attack, and Evade, which allows for narrowly avoiding enemy strikes. Both techniques help players outmaneuver foes while delivering devastating speed attacks from behind."</p><p>The game allows players to switch between the two styles at any time, so they can play how they want. Team Ninja also confirmed that Nioh 3 includes an "open field that offers a new freedom of exploration" for the series. </p><p><span>"Experience unexpected encounters with formidable yokai, explore suspicious villages riddled in violent secrets, and take on the daunting challenges of The Crucible. Enjoy the thrilling, hostile new environments as you fight to survive the cursed kingdom!" Team Ninja said.</span></p>

                <p>The Sony State of Play on June 5 debuted the next game from the Bloodstained series. Bloodstained: The Scarlet Engagement is coming in 2026, and the first trailer showed some of the metroidvania action we can expect.</p><p>The cutscenes for The Scarlet Engagement featured Victorian-style intrigue as guards spoke about castles and magic, but the real thrust of the game was in its combat. The gameplay looked very similar to Ritual of the Night, though it appeared to have much more emphasis on player customization. It's not clear if this game will have a single, specific protagonist like the first game.</p><p>The first Bloodstained was a crowdfunded game from Koji Igarashi, best known for Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Ritual of the Night had a similar tone and spirit, with some of its own intricacies and new features that helped set it apart. Two retro demakes, Curse of the Moon and Curse of the Moon 2, were produced by Inti Creates, to help flesh out the world.</p>

                <p>Grasshopper Manufacture and Suda51 have finally announced a brand-new game for PlayStation 5, and it as every bit of strange as you would expect it to be. Romeo Is A Dead Man is Suda51's first new game in over four years. Players will be controlling the hero Romeo Stargazer, an FBI investigator recently brought back to life by a mysterious device injected into his face by his grandfather. Resurrected as the masked hero "Dead Man," Romeo battles all sorts of undead with a variety of weapons including beam swords, machine guns, and what appear to be electric boxing gloves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nW1cE6sj6h8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nW1cE6sj6h8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Suda51 describes the game as a "strong-style action game," with its aggressive blood sprays and inspirations from Japanese action shows like Kamen Rider. It's very much like previous titles by Grasshopper Manufacture but with a much more aggressive style of combat more like Devil May Cry. The trailer shows off a huge variety of weapons to use and all of their strange effects, like a freezing shot that turns enemies into ice, or electric gauntlets that chain energy across nearby targets. Enemies also have tons of strange effects, shooting massive beams as Romeo as he dodges them.</p><p>It's not known if this game will have open-world elements like in No More Heroes 3, but it's likely with the story involving chasing criminals across spacetime, there will be exploration alongside all the action as well. There were also some hints of vehicle use with some visuals of Romeo riding a motorcycle in the trailer, but we don't see any gameplay of it.</p><p>Romeo is a Dead Man will be out sometime in 2026.</p><p>For more news, check out GameSpot's coverage of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">PlayStation State of Play from June 4th.</a></p>

                <p>In the June 2025 State of Play, Capcom reintroduced Pragmata, an oft-delayed sci-fi game, and announced a planned 2026 release window. Pragmata was originally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-is-a-new-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-pc/1100-6478339/" data-ref-id="1100-6478339">back in 2021</a>, delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcoms-pragmata-has-officially-been-delayed-to-2023/1100-6498139/" data-ref-id="1100-6498139">six months later</a>, and then <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-reminds-us-pragmata-still-exists-then-delays-it-indefinitely/1100-6515152/" data-ref-id="1100-6515152">dropped from Capcom's release calendar entirely</a>. A space action-adventure game, the game follows an astronaut exploring an abandoned space station who encounters a mysterious young girl.</p><p>The trailer shown at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6636/" data-ref-id="2900-6636">State of Play</a> is the most in-depth look Capcom has given of the game so far. It alternates briskly between cutscenes and what appears to be gameplay; a "captured on a PS5 Pro" disclosure displays early on in the footage.</p><p>The trailer starts with the young girl awakening the astronaut after he has been injured. The two begin to wander the space station where he has awoken, bounding through hallways and boosting across gaps, with the girl riding piggyback. They encounter a thin robot wielding a laser sword. During combat, it appears the astronaut can boost for a quick evade, utilize drones, and enlist the girl to use her hacking powers to "freeze" robots. Later in the trailer, you see the pair fight a larger, mech-like robot. The UI displays damage numbers as each hit collides with that enemy.</p><p>At the trailer's end, the astronaut dubs the girl "Diana," loosely based on the string of numbers and letters she offered as name earlier. A note written by the girl appears, reading "2026, It's real XD." Though it reveals more, the trailer hardly breaks the marketing's cryptic streak.</p>
