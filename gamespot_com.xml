While the feature isn't planned to be added until Year 2 Season 3, Ubisoft has shown off some early gameplay footage.</p><p>Despite low player numbers, Ubisoft has just revealed a full year of new content planned for Skull and Bones. While ship-to-ship combat on the high seas is the game's bread and butter, land combat is one of the big items on the menu for Year 2.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skull and Bones: Year 2 Update Announcements Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The teaser shown off as part of the Skull and Bones Year 2 Showcase shows early gameplay with pirates dual-wielding blades and firearms. It looks like players will have the option of getting up close and personal or picking enemies off from a distance, depending on their choice of weapon.</p><p>The new combat style is set to be integrated in Year 2's third season as part of a larger content update adding officers to player ships. In order to recruit said officers, players will have to undertake the land-based missions to rescue officers being held in captivity by the Rogue Warlord.</p><p>From what was shown off in the showcase, the land combat appears to be purely PvE, and takes place entirely on land--meaning boarding enemy ships and on-deck combat is unlikely to arrive with this combat update, despite also being highly requested by players.</p><p>Skull and Bones Year 2 Season 1 has already kicked off, bringing with it item ascension, world tiers, new developments in the world's story, and more new features. Players will have to wait until later in the year for the debut of land combat in Season 3.</p>

                <p> The next Battlefield game doesn't even have an official name yet, but fans are already hands-on with an early build thanks to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs playtest program</a>. That program has proved a headache for devs, with participants leaking footage in spite of NDAs, and starting rumors about the use of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM).</p><p>A rumor that Battlefield 6 would use SBMM, which likely originated from the playtest, has spread through the Battlefield community, with fans up in arms about its potential inclusion. Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland attempted to clarify the use of SBMM with playtesters, in a post that was later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared to Reddit</a>. </p><p>"Just for clarity--saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is 'Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad,'" Sirland said in the post. "But that doesn't make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams--no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn't be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?"</p><p>Sirland added that Battlefield 2042 also would be considered to have SBMM by this definition, and attempted to calm down the conversation by assuring fans that any SBMM used in Battlefield 6 would be applied with a light touch. The response to Sirland's comments being shared to Reddit only reignited the discussion, prompting Battlefield's global community manager T0TALfps to step in. </p><p>"Okay enough," T0TALfps's comment started, trying to put an end to the ongoing discourse. The community manager reminded players that the build that part of the BF Labs playtest is far from a finished game, and there is no guarantee that any feature in it will make it to the finish line in the same form. T0TALfps continued to tell off leakers who ignored NDAs to spread details about the early playtests.</p><p>"There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it," they said. "We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to."</p><p>It will likely be a while until we get more official details on the next Battlefield game--including its official title. According to a recent EA financial report, the company expects the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">release before March 2026</a>. Interested players can still sign up for the <a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs playtest</a> program in the meantime.</p>
