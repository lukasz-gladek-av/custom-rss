According to one prominent dataminer from the MultiVersus community, however, they may not have to look far--Injustice 3 may be on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">MultiverSusie, a well-known dataminer and leaker in the MultiVersus community recently posted a cryptic message to social media platform X that specifically uses the word "injustice" three times. She followed that post up with another that simply wrote the number "3" and nothing else.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">multiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice<br>leaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice</p>  — MultiverSusie (@multiversusie) <a href="https://twitter.com/multiversusie/status/1923533288137724173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"[M]ultiversus shutting down is an injustice, then doing it all again is another injustice," MultiverSusie's post wrote. "[L]eaving me without any leaks is yet again another injustice."</p><p dir="ltr">The previous Injustice games were developed by NetherRealm Studios, which may be moving on to its next project; the developer surprisingly released Mortal Kombat 1: Definitive Edition--which includes the base game, story expansion, and every DLC character--last week with no prior announcement or tease. The Definitive Edition bundle has led many in the Mortal Kombat community to assume that development of Mortal Kombat 1, which was rumored to have been halted by WB earlier this year, has indeed ended.</p><p dir="ltr">The Injustice 3 rumors come months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/">Warner Bros. shuttered three game studios</a>, including Middle-earth: Shadow of War developer Monolith Productions and MultiVersus developer Player First Games. The official statement from WB at the time said the company would be focusing on four key franchises moving forward: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game Of Thrones.</p>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>'s recent delay, confirming the push was less than six months, while he stressed that another delay is unlikely.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBlLUo11qWg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>, Zelnick said GTA 6's delay was "pretty short," amounting to "less than six months."</p><p>GTA 6's new release date is May 26, 2026. Six months prior to that is November 26, 2025. Rockstar never confirmed a specific GTA 6 release date, only stating that it would come out in Fall 2025. If the delay was less than six months, as Zelnick said, this suggests the company was originally eyeing a late-November or December release date for GTA 6. But of course, nothing is absolutely confirmed on that front.</p><p>Now that GTA 6 has a specific release date, Zelnick said it's unlikely that the game will be delayed again. "Generally, when we announce a date, we're able to hit that date," he said.</p><p>A delay for GTA 6 was always likely, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar game in the past 10+ years has been delayed.</a> It is indeed true that when Take-Two announces a specific date--not a vague release window--that the company sticks to its plans. That's not <em>always </em>true, though. GTA V's PS5 and Xbox Series X|S edition, for example, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s-delayed-to-march-2022-new-trailer-shown-at-playstation-showcase/1100-6496035/#:~:text=GTA%205%20On%20PS5%20And,Shown%20At%20PlayStation%20Showcase%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6496035">given a November 11, 2021 release date before shifting to March 2022.</a></p><p>For GTA 6, Zelnick said Rockstar's ambition to create something truly special is an effort that takes time.</p><p>"Rockstar is trying to create the best thing anyone has ever seen in entertainment. Not just interactive entertainment. That's a tall order," he added.</p><h2>"I don't play video games"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick was asked if he's played GTA 6. He apparently has not, as the executive replied, "I'm not a gamer. I don't play video games."</p><p>Zelnick said he does share his opinions "pretty openly" about what he sees with regards to game designs and concepts. However, he said his job as Take-Two's CEO is to attract, motivate, and retain the video game industry's best talent, and then to "get out of their way."</p><p>In other Rockstar news, it's been reported that the studio may be working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">ports of GTA 4 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-feels-really-good-about-switch-2-amid-reports-of-rdr-2-port/1100-6531595/" data-ref-id="1100-6531595">Red Dead Redemption II for Switch 2.</a></p>

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has sounded off on increasing game prices, saying he questions why people are complaining about $80 games when that price is actually a "steal" in terms of what's being offered, at least for some games. He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCTm-cxuYTQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critical Hits Games</a>, stating that many products in regular life have gone up in price over the years, so it was only a matter of time before video games did as well.</p><p>"I think it was almost too late for the video game companies to start looking at the pricing structure," he said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-exec-says-usd70-or-usd80-games-are-a-steal-as-long-as-people-choose-carefully-how-they-spend-their-money-i-dont-think-they-should-be-complaining/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>In the '90s, many new releases sold for $60 USD. Adjusted for inflation, that's around $80 today, which is the price that Nintendo and Xbox will charge for some games this year. Sony, for its part, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-could-get-more-expensive-as-sony-considers-plans-to-deal-with-tariff-impact/1100-6531526/" data-ref-id="1100-6531526">it might increase prices, too.</a></p><p>Not every game will become more expensive, though. Variable pricing in gaming has existed since the beginning, and it's going to continue into the future. As an example, 2K is charging $50 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach the widest possible audience</a>. Yoshida said every game has a "different value [that] it provides," so a game company will decide how to price their product based on the "value that they believe they are bringing in."</p><p>He went on to say that a "really great" game that's priced at $70 or $80 would be a "steal in terms of the amount of entertainment" provided, and the quality of the experience compared to other forms of entertainment.</p><p>"As long as people choose carefully how they spend their money, I don't think they should be complaining," he said.</p><p>Nintendo defended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>'s $80 price point by stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">the game is simply worth that much given what it offers</a>. MK World is the only confirmed $80 game so far, from Nintendo or anyone else, but Microsoft has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">will charge $80 for some Xbox games later this year. </a> Electronic Arts, for its part, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">will not charge $80 for new games</a>, at least not yet.</p><p>Data shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to spend $80 or more on new games.</a></p>
