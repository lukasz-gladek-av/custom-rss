                <p>The people yearn to hike and porter, according to newly released Death Stranding 2 statistics. Director Hideo Kojima has reported that just under 80% percent of players (called "someones" by Kojima) who finished the game continued past the credits. He did not report how many players this represents, but did share a variety of other statistics concerning player behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Kojima tweeted these details out as part of a post celebrating the game's one-month anniversary. It might not surprise you that the assault rifle was Death Stranding 2's most equipped weapon or the ladder its most equipped tool. But the statistics do include some of Death Stranding 2's sillier features. Out of all the animals players could rescue, they saved kangaroos the most (followed by emus and wombats). Via signage, players placed the "speed up" sign the most often. The post doesn't list any player count statistics, but Death Stranding 2 is popular. The game topped <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-and-rematch-top-the-ps5-charts-in-june-2025/2900-6742/">the PS5 charts in June</a>. The statistics also emphasize the game's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-on-the-beach-community-build/1100-6533237/">asynchronous multiplayer</a>, where players build structures and place tips to help each other.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2.<br>It’s been a month since release. It seems many players have already reached the ending. Since all the “Someones” around the world are connected through SSS, we’re able to gather a variety of data. Apparently, 79% of “Someones” who reached the end of the story… <a href="https://t.co/HgXtHsEYWC" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HgXtHsEYWC</a></p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In typical Kojima fashion, the post also features some of his philosophical musings. He wrote, "To everyone who has reached the ending: The world today is in a difficult state. It might be hard to hold on to hope for tomorrow. But know that there is someone out there who would risk their life to protect you—Even if you don’t notice, someone is connected to you, watching over you."</p><p dir="ltr">If you are one of the "someones" who completed Death Stranding 2, check out GameSpot's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-ending-new-game-plus-post-credits/2900-6733/">ending explained guide</a>.</p>

                <p>In classic Call of Duty fashion, the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> is getting a Monster Energy Drink promotional campaign. While the game is still a few months off, special Black Ops 7-themed cans are now appearing in stores.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1949559165476896948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, Black Ops 7 cans are already available for purchase in convenience stores across the United States. In addition to Call of Duty colors and aesthetics, the cans also boast QR codes that will likely take purchasers to a website to input a special code hidden on the can.</p><p>Right now, the QR code simply takes you to the landing page for the old promo for Black Ops 6, suggesting that these cans are getting out into the wild a bit earlier than anticipated. Chances are good that you'll be able to snag some Double XP for the new game if you get your hands on one of these.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches later this year, and it will mark the first-ever back-to-back releases for a Call of Duty sub-series. It's in co-development at Treyarch and Raven Software, and it'll star Milo Ventimiglia (This is Us, Gilmore Girls) as David Mason, Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) as Emma Kagan, and Michael Rooker (Guardians of the Galaxy) as Mike Harper.</p><p>Besides these details and a short teaser trailer that Microsoft showed off at Summer Game Fest, we don't know much about the game--but that'll change soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-set-for-gamescom-in-august/1100-6533147/" data-ref-id="1100-6533147">Black Ops 7 will have a full reveal at Gamescom</a> in mid-August. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-continues-franchises-obsession-with-weed/1100-6533294/" data-ref-id="1100-6533294">There may also be a big Call of Duty event in September</a>, although Microsoft has yet to confirm this.</p>

                <p>Due to pressure from payment processors and right-wing advocacy groups, the marketplaces Itch.io and Steam recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">they would be delisting or de-indexing games that were perceived as "Not Safe For Work."</a> While apparently intended to disrupt the production and marketing of adult-content games, this move has already had a much broader impact: The critically acclaimed horror game Mouthwashing has been de-indexed from Itch.io as part of this sweep. </p><p>Martin Halldin, who works on audio and music for Mouthwashing developer Wrong Organ, posted on Bluesky that the title had been de-indexed from Itch.io. Halldin wrote that the game is currently still accessible if you have the link--it hasn't been fully removed yet--but not showing up in search results can still have a devastating impact on indie titles.  </p><p>After its launch in 2024, Mouthwashing racked up extensive acclaim and a number of end-of-year accolades. Its Steam reviews are sitting at Overwhelmingly Positive with over 28,000 user reviews submitted--a remarkable total for a game created by a small and previously unknown team. It is a psychological horror game, and the developer itself even warns on the product page that Mouthwashing contains "extreme violence, gore, mutilation and worse on PSX-style characters." </p><p>Despite its obviously mature content and themes, Mouthwashing does not contain pornography and is not sexually explicit--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">which was ostensibly the main target of the campaign organized by advocacy group Collective Shout.</a> Despite the group's declared focus on preventing the depiction of "sexual abuse" in games, the campaign's impact has been to seemingly induce a much broader push to "de-risk" from <em>all </em>adult content, no matter its subject. As a result, horror games and other titles depicting subjects far afield from anything sexual have also been affected. <span><br></span></p><p>Developers and fans of affected games have been attempting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">to organize counter-pressure</a> to encourage payment processors to reverse their stance. Civil liberties NGOs like the ACLU have already joined the fight, too; the ACLU, for instance, <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">is currently soliciting signatures for a petition against Mastercard</a>.</p>
