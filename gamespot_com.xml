                <p>Epic Games has come up with an entirely new way to promote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">Chapter 6 finale event</a> and launch of Chapter 7 this weekend: by briefly turning the storm circle into a "storm seven" for an hour on Tuesday morning. Look at this:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047" data-ratio="0.562423500612" data-width="1634" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4612047"></a><figcaption>Fortnite Battle Royale's storm circle took on a new shape for a bit.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4612047-fortnitesevencircle.jpg"></figure><p>The change occurred at 6 AM PT and was reverted at 7 AM, with all games that started during that one-hour window having this odd new storm circle. The change was a promotional stunt to build hype for the Chapter 7 launch on Saturday, November 29--the chapter finale live event, which will only play one time ever, is Fortnite's biggest event every year, as it usually draws player counts in the tens of millions for whatever spectacle Epic has in store.</p><p>But the emphasis on the number 7 isn't just because we're about to start Chapter 7. During the finale live event we're also expecting the return of the Seven--Fortnite's Avengers-esque team of superheroes that had been led by Dwayne "The Foundation" Johnson until the end of Chapter 3, when they were eaten by evil liquid chrome. No members of the Seven have been seen since the start of Chapter 4, and the game pretty much stopped referencing them completely in Chapter 5, so their return would be a big deal.</p><p>The Chapter 6 finale is going down on November 29 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET, with virtual doors opening 40 minutes before. You can read more about what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-finale-live-event-everything-you-need-to-know-about-zero-hour/1100-6536400/" data-ref-id="1100-6536400">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Ex-GTA boss Dan Houser has an explanation for why he believes the Grand Theft Auto franchise has been so successful for Rockstar Games, and it might not surprise you, but it's fascinating hearing him recall some history.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taaJ8EIebQ8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a brief conversation with Channel 4's Sunday Brunch</a> on November 23, the English producer and writer was asked if what led to GTA's mega-success had anything to do with the fact that the game is this sort of simulation for the version of ourselves that we can't actually live out.</p>

<p>"I think partly," Houser said. "I think it's partly that, partly it put you in this exaggerated cinematic world, and mostly I would argue because it was this sense of freedom. Before that, games were either a shooting game or a driving game or a simulation game, and [GTA] was all three smashed together in a way that felt very free. And just, also, you know, when people talk about the metaverse or this digital world, those were the first games that showed you this idea of living in this fake place."</p><p>Houser went on to say that it was really GTA 3 that skyrocketed the franchise's popularity. Although the game came out two months after the devastating attack against the Twin Towers in New York, Houser noted that the team (formerly DMA Designs, now Rockstar North) was still excited about the project because there was something "magical" about what GTA 3 was doing.</p><p>"I think all of the team felt, with GTA 3, which was the kind of big breakthrough one in 2001 and we were very much running out of money at the time as a company--I think all of the team thought, 'This could be amazing. There's something really magical about this,'" Houser continued. "It was very raw and put together, but as it began to come together, it had these sort of moments of real innovation and real, kind of--it felt like the future in a way. But then, until it came out, no one outside of our company was very excited by it. That came out just after 9/11 in late 2001, and as it came out, people started to get more excited about it."</p><p>While Houser reminisced about the GTA series during the chat, he also talked about the controversial technology everyone loves to talk about: AI. He's currently "dabbling" with it but believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-boss-dan-houser-thinks-ai-is-overrated/1100-6536480/" data-ref-id="1100-6536480">it's overrated</a> and "not as useful" as some would have you believe.</p><p>In other Grand Theft Auto news, Rockstar Games announced earlier this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">GTA VI has been delayed</a> to November 2026. The company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-rockstar-delay-gta-6/1100-6536423/" data-ref-id="1100-6536423">a history of delaying its games</a>, which we broke down in detail. There has also been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">some new information regarding the fired Rockstar employees</a> that came to light, including the messages they allegedly shared before termination. It all paints a dour picture for GTA VI, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">analysts believe won't save the struggles the games industry has faced</a> lately, despite its almost-certain success.</p>
