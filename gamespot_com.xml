                <p>Bandai Namco has announced Mobile Suit Gundam Seed: Battle Destiny Remastered and it is set to launch on May 22 for PC and Nintendo Switch. The original game was released in 2012 for the PlayStation Vita, but had not been released outside Japan.</p><p>In this game, players will be able to tackle its story missions and relive moments from the Mobile Suit Gundam Seed and Seed Destiny anime. There are three factions to choose from: Earth Alliance Forces, ZAFT, and the Archangel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX1GfnTWz-w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NX1GfnTWz-w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This remaster will have enhanced visuals and revamped user-interface readability, as well as new quality-of-life features like lock-on mode and improved tuning. The announcement trailer goes over the basic premise of the game and it also seemingly reveals that while the text is in English, the voice dub will remain Japanese-only.</p><p>Over 100 suits will be available as well, and they come from various other Gundam anime spin-offs such as Mobile Suit Gundam Seed C.E.73 Stargazer, Astray, X Astray, VS Astray, MSV, and Destiny MSV.</p><p>This isn't the first Vita game that Bandai Namco has brought over to modern platforms. Last month, Bandai Namco launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-vita-exclusives-is-getting-remastered/1100-6526546/" data-ref-id="1100-6526546">Freedom Wars Remastered for PC, PS4, and Switch</a>. Freedom Wars was also previously a Vita exclusive, but was published under Sony in 2014.</p>

                <p>Nightdive Studios finally gave us a long-awaited update on its remaster of System Shock 2. Previously known as System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition, this modernized remaster of the iconic and influential 1999 sci-fi shooter is now titled System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster, and we'll learn its release date next month.</p><p>Irrational Games and Looking Glass Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock-2/" data-ref-id="5000-278">System Shock 2</a> is a sci-fi shooter in which players explore and try to survive on a starship that has been taken over by an evil AI called SHODAN. While it wasn't a commercial success at the time of its release, it was trailblazing for narrative storytelling in video games, setting design standards that would go on to influence games like BioShock. It's also the game that put Nightdive Studios on the map, as it acquired the rights to the series and re-released it on Steam in 2013.</p><p>Since then, Nightdive has made a name for itself by remastering PC-shooter classics like Turok: Dinosaur Hunter, Quake, Rise of the Triad, and Star Wars: Dark Forces with its game engine KEX. While Nightdive retained ownership of the System Shock IP and even developed a full-on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/system-shock/" data-ref-id="5000-453538">remake of the first System Shock</a>, a KEX Engine remaster of System Shock 2 has taken a while to come out. Nightdive Studios first teased that it was working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-announced-and-in-d/1100-6469015/" data-ref-id="1100-6469015">System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition in 2019</a>, but updates on this project have been spotty over the years.</p><p>Now, Nightdive Studios is ready to talk about it again. It promises to reveal a specific release date at GDC 2025's Future Game Show Spring Showcase. That means it should be out quite soon -- certainly before the game turns 26 this August.</p><p>Whenever System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster does come out, it will be available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p>From Software has issued an apology for the connection issues currently plaguing the Elden Ring Nightreign network test.</p><p>From Software's Japanese player-support account on <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890361803944718443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> said that the servers are currently congested, which is making it difficult for players to match with each other.

Each session is only three hours long, so the server issues really eat away a chunk of the available time that players have to try out Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on May 30 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6529408/" data-ref-id="1100-6529408">not have any microtransactions, but will have a one-time purchase DLC</a>.</p><p>For more Elden Ring Nightreign coverage, make sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/" data-ref-id="1100-6529380">interview with director Junya Ishizaki</a> as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">preview impressions</a>.</p><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta test also experienced network issues last weekend, although that was PlayStation's fault as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psn-is-down/1100-6529341/" data-ref-id="1100-6529341">PSN was down for nearly 24 hours</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Los Angeles and surrounding areas were ravaged by devastating wildfires.
