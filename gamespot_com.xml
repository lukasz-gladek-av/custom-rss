                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford has insisted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/" data-ref-id="1100-6531192">recent release date change</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> has nothing to do with "any other product's actual or theoretical launch date."</p><p>Pitchford issued this statement on social media after many people said they thought Gearbox shifted Borderlands 4 date forward 11 days to September 12 to give Borderlands 4 more room to breathe before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> comes out. GTA 6, of course, has no release date, but some are speculating it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">could launch in October. </a></p><p>So why was Borderlands 4's release date brought forward? Pitchford said it was "100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates."</p><p>Pitchford said the decision was "literally 0%" about another game's confirmed or speculated release date.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates. Our decision is literally 0% about any other product’s actual or theoretical launch date.</p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Borderlands fans don't have to wait much longer to learn more about the game, though, as a PlayStation State of Play dedicated to Borderlands 4 is taking place today, April 30. The event begins at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET and will be streamed live.</p><p>Gearbox and Rockstar Games share a parent company in Take-Two, and the company has discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">giving each of its titles room to shine</a>. Take-Two's 2K division also has Mafia: The Old Country on the way, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-seemingly-leaked-for-august/1100-6530796/" data-ref-id="1100-6530796">reportedly set for release in August</a>.</p><p>Some are theorizing that Take-Two could have a banner year in 2025, with Mafia: The Old Country coming in August, Borderlands 4 and NBA 2K26 in September, and GTA 6 potentially in October.</p><p>GTA 6 alone is expected to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copies in its first year</a>, and <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/3ae54582-44bf-4163-9024-4da314c31541" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands is 2K's most successful franchise ever based on unit sales</a>. Never before have there been new entries in the Borderlands and GTA main franchises released in the same year.</p>
