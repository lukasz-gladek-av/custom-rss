It doesn't appear to be a hardware problem either, as Switch 2 users have reported that the console isn't correctly registering how much of a battery charge is left, resulting in them being told that they're almost out of power after playing for only a short amount of time.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo" rel="nofollow ">According to Nintendo</a>, the quick fix for this problem is to enter the secret Recovery Mode on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>This should reset the console battery, and it can be done by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Make certain that your Switch 2 has the latest system update</li><li>Power off your Switch 2 completely</li><li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the power button <strong>once</strong> to turn the system back on</li><li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears</li><li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the power button until it turns off</li><li>Power the console back on</li></ul><p>Our testing confirms that this method does work--my Switch 2 would only charge up to 82% with the power-saving mode enabled but it now reaches a charging percentage of 89%--and there is a second solution here just in case this one doesn't work.</p><p>This requires a few more steps, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo advises charging the Switch 2 to 100%</a> and then letting the battery drain until it is <em>almost </em>empty--a complete drain is harmful to overall battery life--and then charging it back up to 100% again. Doing this several times should "gradually" improve the battery charge indicator, Nintendo says.</p><ul><li>Ensure the console has the latest system update</li><li>Set all three Auto-Sleep mode settings to "Never"</li><li>Connect the AC adapter directly to the console</li><li>Allow the console to charge until the battery is 100% fully charged, or until the console has been charging for at least three hours</li><li>Leave the console alone and connected to the AC adapter for an additional hour</li><li>When an hour has passed, disconnect the AC adapter from the console and allow the console to display the Home menu for approximately three to four hours</li><li>The remaining battery life must be depleted as much as possible</li><li>Once the battery charge is almost depleted, power off the console and leave it alone for at least 30 minutes</li><li>Repeat these steps 3 several more times</li><li>The battery charge indicator will improve gradually by repeating this process several times</li></ul><p>If that's not enough to fix the problems on the Switch 2, Nintendo recommends sending it in to be serviced. With the Switch 2 now out, owners have discovered several tips for ensuring that the device runs in peak condition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-improve-switch-2-battery-life/1100-6531649/">There are several ways to ensure that the Switch 2 battery has a long life</a>.

                <p>Get your Splattershots ready--Nintendo's beloved shooter series Splatoon is getting its first spin-off game. The Nintendo Today app shared the announcement of Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off featuring the Deep Cut idol band from Splatoon 3. It's coming out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, while Splatoon 3 is receiving a free Switch 2 update this week.</p><p>The Splatoon Raiders trailer depicted Deep Cut members Shiver, Frye, and Big Man on a helicopter, discussing their next treasure-hunting destination, the Spirhalite Islands. Their helicopter crash-lands, setting the stage for an island adventure. Players will take the role of a mechanic, exploring the mysterious new locale with Deep Cut.</p><p>While the Nintendo Today video showed some action, it didn't share any specific objectives or details about the gameplay loop of Splatoon Raiders. The video also lacked any details about a release window.</p><p>Watch the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ve2zWmkEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, scheduled for June 12, will freshen the game up for Nintendo Switch 2. Along with improved visuals and performance, especially in hubs like Splatsville, which were capped at 30fps on the original Switch. More importantly, this version 10.0.0 update for Splatoon 3 includes new weapons.</p><p>The Splatlands Collection of 30 weapons features familiar ink-splatting artillery but with different loadouts of sub- and special weapons, along with unique visual designs. And for the more hardcore competitive players, the upcoming patch includes a new stat in the ranked Anarchy Battles called Series Weapon Power, which tracks win/loss ratios per weapon and matches players with others with similar ratings.</p><p>The Splatoon 3 update is a welcome surprise, considering Nintendo only planned to add new content to the game for two years after its September 2022 launch. It's also another fun addition to the growing list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Switch 1 games getting a free update</a> for the new hardware. And while Splatoon Raiders isn't necessarily a proper fourth installment, the spin-off may satisfy Splatoon players, especially all those Big Man fans out there.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Mario Party is a game lots of players love, but often not without reservations. The big knock against the series has long been its late-game antics, which can render strategy meaningless by creating huge swings that can suddenly shuffle the standings, regardless of how well or poorly you've been playing all along. Handing out bonus stars like Oprah gifting her audience with cars just doesn't make for a good virtual board game.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also not so predictable which of the many categories of minigames will be involved in any Mario Party endgame moment, and as a result, not always so much fun to play, even while the rest of a session might be enjoyable. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-party/" data-ref-id="5000-681517">Lego Party</a>, a similar minigame-laden multiplayer party game, is intended to be similar to Mario Party but without that annoyance for players, allowing them to strategize more reliably.</p><p dir="ltr">The team behind Lego Party removed the concept of bonus stars (gold bricks in this case) from their take on the party minigame genre, because the team understood that having late-game bonuses that can invalidate playing well in the early game is not an enjoyable mechanic. "I just don't like them," SMG Studio project director Mark Fennell told me bluntly. It feels like randomness added where it doesn't belong. And I can say its absence was appreciated in my Lego Party demo at Summer Game Fest 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2PgTclraWk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A2PgTclraWk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only pain point Lego Party seeks to address as a party "board" game. Like in Mario Party, you can steal items, including highly valuable gold bricks, from other players, if the right conditions are met. In Mario Party, you can decline to buy a star when offered, but you can't decline to steal from another player (either a star or coins) if you land on the board game space that says you have to do so. In Lego Party, that's not the case. Since the Lego Party team expects the game to have an audience of players with mixed experience levels, or parents playing with their kids, the change leaves room for the game's older or more mature players to show mercy to younger ones.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did over 100 playtests, and we had some tears," a developer told me, speaking to the times when kids would cry because they'd suffered a loss in the game. Lego Party was re-tuned with this feedback in mind. The option to steal gold bricks can now be declined by the pilfering player. If you're a parent trying to go easy on your kid, you'll have the opportunity <em>not</em> to go through with the action that's going to upset them. It's a nice touch that makes the game kid-friendlier. And of course, if you <em>don't</em> want to go easy on another player, you can just choose not to.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet another small tweak to the rules results in big changes to how games unfold. The player turn order isn't static, like it is in Mario Party, where it's chosen at the beginning of the game. Instead, each turn is given a new order based on the most recent minigame results. If you were just a space away from scoring a star in Mario Party and you're first in the turn order, you can rest assured you'll get it after the next minigame, no matter what happens. In Lego Party, however, you're gonna need to lock in, because the winner of the minigame gains turn priority. That means they could beat you to the gold brick when your group returns to moving around the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party will launch with four boards and over 60 minigames, and those I saw were a fun mix of play styles and objectives. My favorite was one in which players would need to grapple up to a moving platform--a small dancefloor, really--and amass points for staying on it and grooving away. I also saw games like a rally race, a memory test, and a familiar one where players compete for painted space on the ground, constantly painting over each other's brushstrokes.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Party benefits from being recognizable; it's "Mario Party but Lego," for the most part, and though that's a fun proposition, its merits may come down more to how it differs, and in particular, how it improves on Nintendo's long-standing party game.</p>

                <p>Developer Raccoon Logic worked with Microsoft to bring Revenge of the Savage Planet to Xbox Game Pass as a day-one launch title, but studio head Alex Hutchinson said new games launching into Game Pass can "devalue" them and hurt the industry overall.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://gamersocialclub.ca/2025/06/09/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-creative-director-alex-hutchinson-talks-success-game-pass-the-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamer Social Club</a>, Hutchinson said "most of the traffic" so far for Revenge of the Savage Planet has been from Game Pass, while full-game sales "have been good." The game is also available on PS5 and PS4.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Revenge Of The Savage - 20 Minutes Of Gameplay With The Devs</p>
      </div>
<p>As for bringing the game to Game Pass at launch, Hutchinson said working with Microsoft--and presumably taking payment from the company--was part of Raccoon Logic's balancing effort of trying to reach as many people as possible and making money. The financial terms of Game Pass deals are not made public, but it's understood that Microsoft pays developers to bring their games to Game Pass at launch as part of the Xbox company's ambition to scale the service and attract new users.</p><p>Hutchinson said the "whole industry should agree to only allow games on subscription services a year after release." He said the video game industry should embrace the traditional movie model where a film debuts in theaters exclusively and then comes to DVD, TV, or a streaming service.</p><p>"The current structure will prove very damaging to anyone who is not owned by a publisher soon if it continues," Hutchinson said. <a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1932143109493674096" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Posting on social media</a>, Hutchinson said Nintendo stands alone with respect to retaining the value of games. "Everyone except Nintendo is also in a race to value content at zero which will end in tears," he said.</p><p>Hutchinson is saying this as a person who took a deal from Microsoft to launch Revenge of the Savage Planet into Game Pass on day one, so what gives? He said the studio's hope with making a deal with Microsoft was to help Revenge of the Savage Planet get exposure that would in turn encourage people to buy a DLC pack or encourage a friend to buy the game. That's not what's happened, though.</p><p>"We haven't seen that, or at least not yet. What we've seen is that content has been devalued and that people are less willing to pay for things, which in the long run will likely mean less games being made and a lot more studios going under," he said.</p><p>As for the Game Pass payments from Microsoft, Hutchinson said it was true that the checks were "big enough to make a difference," but that was "years ago."</p><p>"These days unless your game is tiny, or you're a rare enormous brand, it isn't much. But Microsoft have been amazing partners and we're so glad to be working with them," he said.</p><p>Game Pass is a paradigm shift for gaming, and it's a model that no other major competitor has embraced. For its part, Sony has said it will not launch its new games into PlayStation Plus on day one because of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">how it can erode and negatively impact its overall value chain and ecosystem.</a> Nintendo doesn't have a similar program, either, and is historically known for holding prices, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">in the case of Mario Kart World, increasing prices.</a></p><p>Hutchinson directed Assassin's Creed III and Far Cry 4 while at Ubisoft before leaving to start Typhoon Studios, which released Journey to the Savage Planet in 2020. Google acquired Typhoon for its failed Stadia gaming ambitions, before closing the studio and scuttling Stadia. Hutchinson then founded Raccoon Logic in 2021, releasing Revenge of the Savage Planet in May 2025.</p>
