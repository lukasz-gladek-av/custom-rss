                <p>Drag x Drive, the Nintendo-developed wheelchair basketball game, will be getting a limited-time demo ahead of its launch next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo announced via the Nintendo Today app (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>) that the "Drag x Drive: Global Jam", which will take place from Saturday, August 9 to Sunday, August 10 across three time slots. Nintendo Switch 2 owners with a Nintendo Switch Online membership can try out the online team-based multiplayer before its official launch on August 14.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hku89o38-hQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Hku89o38-hQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The three sessions will take place at the following dates and times:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Saturday, August 9, 3 AM to 7 AM PT / 6 AM to 10 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Saturday, August 9, 5 PM to 9 PM PT / 8 PM to 11 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Sunday, August 10, 9 AM to 1 PM PT / 6 AM to 10 AM ET</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Drag x Drive was revealed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> earlier this year as one of the titles being developed by Nintendo internally. The 3v3 sports game is played by using both Joy-Cons in mouse mode to control the player's wheelchair, although shooting the ball requires using motion-control gestures.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, it's the sole first-party Switch 2 release to make extensive use of mouse controls, although it's not known if it will be possible to play the game with other control configurations. The upcoming Super Mario Party Jamboree Switch 2 Edition features a new mode called Jamboree TV that will feature new mouse-based minigames, while Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also include the option to play with mouse controls for aiming. As far as third-party games go, both Cyberpunk 2077 and Civilization 7 have mouse-control options.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the more expensive first-party releases like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza, Drag x Drive is launching as a digital exclusive for $20. It is available to preorder from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/drag-x-drive-switch-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eShop</a>.</p>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has teased plans to add more content to Fallout 76 based on the Prime Video TV series. Creative director Jon Rush said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game studio and TV teams are in discussion "all the time," but it's too soon to say what specific content may be in the works.</p><p>"Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it's stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I'm not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another," Rush said.</p><p>While there may be opportunities for crossover content, Rush pointed out that Fallout 76's story is the furthest back in time for the series and the TV show is the furthest into the future. "So there's a lot of room where we don't necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories ,that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple," Rush said.</p><p>Fallout 76's Season 21 update launched in June, and the introduction of fishing was its biggest draw.

And while MGM has been very protective of Bond, there was only one specific request made by the studio during production of the game.</p><p>IO Interactive franchise director Jonathan Lacaille recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that aside from a request, "Don't make him a killing machine,'" the studio has been very open to IO Interactive's new take on Bond.</p><p>"They've considered every idea we've had," recalled Lacaille. "There weren't many massive nos or anything like that. It was always more like, 'Yeah, but, we could do it this way, or…' So it's always been very collaborative, and a lot of good feedback, because they've been working with the franchise for so long as well, so it was great to have them so involved in the project, right? I'm sure it was a fun ride for them as well.'</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has previously hinted that 007 First Light may incorporate a live-service element from the Hitman games by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-may-have-hitman-like-live-service-missions/1100-6532678/" data-ref-id="1100-6532678">dropping new missions for Bond</a> during the game's post-launch period.</p><p>Hitman: World of Assassination recently had an example of what that may look like when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. In that Elusive Target mission, Hitman's Agent 47 gets to decide how he wants to eliminate LeChiffre while still managing to escape with his life.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous take on Bond and it features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>
