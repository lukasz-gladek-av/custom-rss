                <p>Microsoft is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>, but what are they and when will we learn about them? It might not be a whole lot longer until Halo's future comes into focus. Halo Studios has announced that it will share more information about what's next for Halo at the Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Halo Studios said it's observed "a fair amount of speculation about when and where more details might emerge" about the next Halo projects currently underway. "We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the developer said.</p><p>It was at last year's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including Project Foundry. This was also when Microsoft announced that 343 Industries was rebranding as Halo Studios.</p><p>"For us, A New Dawn was just the beginning--at this year's HaloWC, we look forward to continuing the conversation," the developer said. "Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The event takes place October 24-26 in Seattle.

Microsoft has made major changes since then, including installing a new executive leadership team and switching game engines, while acknowledging that Halo Infinite missed the mark in some respects. Xbox boss Matt Booty previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">Halo Infinite's launch was like a runner tripping at the finish line.</a></p><p>"Halo Infinite was the last remnant of how we made Halo games in the past.

                <p>The Animaniacs was the follow-up series to Tiny Toon Adventures and introduced young audiences to the Warner Bros. characters Wakko, Yakko, and their sister, Dot. The animated program was a huge hit, spawning merchandise, a movie, and nine video games--including the two spin-off games focused on Pinky and The Brain. Recently, however, a never-released tenth game has been unearthed, and it would have been released on Game Boy Advance.</p><p>The preservationist group <a href="https://hiddenpalace.org/News/Animaniacs_-_Hollywood_Hypnotics" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hidden Palace</a> released information about the game, Animaniacs: Hollywood Hypnotics, and even uploaded it so players can now play the long-lost game. You can watch some gameplay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6EQ4aeWY9M" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HiddenPalaceOrg/status/1939452768210604173" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Hello again!

The Brain wanted to take over the famous Warner Bros. Water Tower--and the Warners' lair--and turn it into a rocket. The title of the game came from the duo using hypnosis to put their plan into action.</p><p>The game was likely to be released in 2003 after what seems like an incredibly bumpy road to production. Initially starting as a project for the publisher Conspiracy Entertainment, it was eventually rebooted under another company named Swing Entertainment. It was put aside after Swing entered insolvency proceedings also in 2003, officially putting an end to the project.</p><p>Swing would eventually release Animaniacs: The Great Edgar Hunt for GameCube, Xbox, and PlayStation 2 in 2005--it would be one of the last Animaniacs games made.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has strongly suggested that the original Switch is about to get more expensive for millions of people. In Canada, Nintendo said it will change prices on the Switch family of consoles, including the Switch, Switch Lite, and Switch OLED.</p><p>Physical and digital Switch games and accessories could be getting more expensive in Canada as well, along with Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions and Amiibo toys.</p><p><a href="https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/nintendo-switch-pricing-update-892304996.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's announcement</a> did not say if pricing is going up or down--only that a "pricing update" is coming--but many believe this will be a price increase due to the wording specifically mentioning that the changes are coming due to "market conditions." GameSpot has contacted Nintendo in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>Whatever the case, the pricing changes do not apply to the Switch 2 console, games, or accessories. Nintendo of Canada did not announce what the price changes will be, but the company said it will share this information on the Nintendo of Canada website on August 1.</p><p>Recently, US President Donald Trump announced that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/27/trump-canada-trade-talks-tariffs.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he was ending trade talks with Canada</a> over the country's digital services tax proposal. That's no longer going forward, however, with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/30/canada-rescinds-digital-services-tax-after-trump-cuts-off-us-trade-talks.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Canada walking back plans.</a></p><p>The Switch currently sells for $400 CAD, with the Switch OLED going for $450 CAD, and the Switch Lite selling for $260 CAD. The Switch 2, meanwhile, sells for $630 CAD or $700 CAD for the Mario Kart World bundle.</p><p>Many expected the Switch 2 to get more expensive in the US following Nintendo's announcement of the device's price on April 2, which was the same day that Trump announced his "Liberation" tariff plan. While Nintendo did not raise prices on the console in the US, where it sells for $450 or $500 with Mario Kart World, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">did jack up prices on some accessories.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 officially launched on June 5 and became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">fastest-selling console from any company in history.</a></p>

                <p>It's a big day for Game Pass, as the library grows with the addition of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-11-more-games-soon-including-a-great-call-of-duty-game/2900-6674/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6674">underrated Call of Duty game</a>, Call of Duty: WWII. The game is available now on console and PC not just for Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but also the less-expensive Game Pass Standard tier.</p><p>Originally released in 2017, Call of Duty: WWII was developed by Sledgehammer Games and was notable at the time in part for being the first WWII-set CoD game since 2008's Call of Duty: World at War. Some of its most memorable missions including the Saving Private Ryan-like D-Day opening sequence and a mission where you go undercover in a German building in Paris featuring some tense moments.</p><p>You play as Ronald "Red" Daniels, with supporting squadmates including soldiers voiced by people like Josh Duhamel, Jeffrey Pierce, Jonathan Tucker, and Brett Zimmerman.
