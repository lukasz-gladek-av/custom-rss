                <p>After years of anticipation, Team Cherry only gave the video game industry and players two weeks notice that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was about to arrive on September 4. While a handful of indie games were moved away from that date, Rogue Factor had already staked out the same release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538">Hell is Us</a> six months earlier. Now, Hell is Us' creative director is sharing his belief that Silksong's shadow drop negatively impacted Hell is Us' sales, and he doesn't sound happy about it.</p><p>Jonathan Jacques-Belletête acknowledged that Team Cherry had the right to pick any date it wanted to during his appearance on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opeNl55y-0Y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friends Per Second</a> podcast (via <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/news/hell-is-us-developer-silksong-release-date-surprise-was-a-little-callous/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week in Video Games</a>). However, Jacques-Belletête feels that the decision to do so on such short notice was "a little callous."</p><p>"When you know you're that big, I think a shadow drop is a bit like--'wow,'" said Jacques-Belletête. "As the 'GTA 6 of indie' ... to shadow drop something like this is a little callous."</p><p>According to Jacques-Belletête, discussions were held between Rogue Factor and publisher Nacon about delaying Hell is Us. But there were too many complicating factors, including the need to refund any pre-orders that had already been placed.</p><p>"We decided to keep the date, and I'm happy that we did," added Jacques-Belletête. "We're still much bigger than some of the smaller ones who would have gotten a lot more affected and who decided to change their dates. Changing the date of Hell Is Us would have been a pretty big [endeavor]."</p><p>Jacques-Belletête went on to note that he believes Silksong's release hurt Hell is Us' sales, but also acknowledged that he doesn't currently have the sales numbers available to illustrate that point.</p><p>As for Silksong, it debuted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-had-a-massive-steam-player-count-over-its-first-weekend/1100-6534537/" data-ref-id="1100-6534537">a massive concurrent player count on Steam during its first weekend</a>. A common complaint about the game is that it's too difficult, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">mods designed to make Silksong easier</a> were released almost immediately. Team Cherry subsequently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">its own patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>.</p>

                <p>SpongeBob has gone on plenty of video game adventures, and on October 31, you can grab a physical edition of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SpongeBob-SquarePants-Bundle-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0FQGNGKZH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</a> that collects two of SpongeBob's best games--Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated and The Cosmic Shake--into a single physical release. Preorders for the two-game collection are available at Amazon for just $35--that's a 50% price cut compared to the digital version of the bundle that's already available for $70 on the Switch eShop.</p><p>The Cosmic Shake is the better (and newer) of the two games, and it earned solid marks from critics.

"Despite a few hiccups and disappointing aspects of The Cosmic Shake design, at its core it achieves its goals," writes GameSpot reviewer James Carr.</p><p>The other game in the bundle, Battle for Bikini Bottom Rehydrated, earned similar reviews, giving nostalgic fans a massive version of the underwater town to roam around as SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566184"></a><figcaption>SpongeBob SquarePants: Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566184-817zljshhpl._sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4566185,1300-4566186,1300-4566187" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566185-81wev8fdc2l._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566186-81j4iyz4ifl._sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4566187-81e2grgxz9l._sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>This new Switch physical edition bundle isn't the only way to get your SpongeBob fix.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Destiny: The Taken King is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, September 15, 2025. Below, we look back at how it came to represent the years of Destiny, and live-service games more broadly, that would follow.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Ten years ago, Bungie performed a miracle. It also, unfortunately, invoked a curse.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2014, the studio renowned for the Halo franchise launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny</a>, which promised to blend its penchant for dynamic single-player campaigns and kinetic multiplayer gameplay with the framework and community-oriented features of MMOs. And while the game was released to an excited and impressionable audience, it floundered. Its opening salvo felt limp and incomplete--a sentiment that <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731" rel="nofollow ">later reporting</a> would confirm--but it maintained a playerbase through a spate of smaller middling DLC releases leading up to The Taken King, Destiny's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-the-taken-king-review/1900-6416250/">first major expansion and saving grace</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Taken King launched on September 15, 2015 and--I say this without exaggeration--revolutionized the game, which felt aimless till its arrival. Destiny's worlds, while large and beautiful, felt quiet and devoid of life. Its cast felt more like disparate archetypes thrown in a blender than a cohesive company. And its paper-thin plot...well, it was just that. Destiny wasn't without merit--it excelled in gunplay, boasted an art style that blended sci-fi and fantasy seamlessly, and the level design of its strikes and raids were still exemplary--but all of that felt pointed at nothing in particular. The Taken King whipped it into shape.</p><p dir="ltr">From its opening mission through to the riotous end of its raid, The Taken King was sharp in a way the initial release of Destiny could only ever dream of. For 10 years now, I've been struck by the construction of the expansion's first level, where the player must mount a defense of a besieged base on Phobos, and how much livelier it felt than anything Destiny had done in the year prior. Small touches, like an enemy ship cresting over a hill and shining its spotlight on the player, as well as the sights and sounds of explosions in the distance, finally broke up the almost glacial front that permeated Destiny's destinations. It was like throwing a rock into still water.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="635421816" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

It breathed life into characters that could've fallen by the wayside, like Eris Morn. It provided a bounty of secrets nestled in the crevices of the Dreadnaught. Hell, it even gave players a quest log! It cannot be overstated how amorphous Destiny felt before The Taken King's arrival, and how wonderful it felt to bask in it for the weeks and months to come. It hadn't just come to life, but become even larger in scope. At last, I felt like I was taking part in the epic struggle between light and darkness that Destiny had been billed as while I flitted through the cosmos and used my spectacular powers and weaponry to live out the adventures of my dreams.</p><p dir="ltr">For all intents and purposes, Destiny had mounted the comeback it needed. With some narrative direction and goodwill on its side, it had enough gas to continue its ascent. So what curse could I possibly have been referring to earlier?</p><p dir="ltr">The unfortunate problem with Destiny is that it never stopped needing saving. If you're at all familiar with the arc of the series, you may be tangentially aware of the bumpy road the games, as well as the company behind it, have been on ever since. For every high--every Taken King or Forsaken, which came at a similar time in Destiny 2's lifetime--there have been some standout lows. Unfortunately, while Destiny's history is marked by a long line of comebacks, it's just as stained by these immense valleys, brought on often by frequent retooling and reinvention that steadily eroded any ground which could provide it stable footing. And even though Destiny had proven, much like Rainbow Six Siege and No Man's Sky, that a live-service game could bounce back, it also stood as proof positive of how volatile ongoing games could be. It has typified the often harsh ebb and flow of the model.</p><p dir="ltr">You see, Destiny never really enjoyed a sense of stability. While Bungie devised a way forward for its ambitious series, the games suffered content droughts that turned its community against the game at several points in its lengthy lifetime. To solve this problem, Bungie figured out a cadence and template for content drops, like expansions, title updates, and seasonal events, that would supplement the community and feed the machine.</p><p dir="ltr">We often talk about the live-service treadmill from the perspective of the consumer, which is always a helpful viewpoint to contextualize its impact and potential harm. But what often feels under-discussed is the effect that this work has on the people who make the content for these never-ending games. And while some titles, like Epic Games' Fortnite, seemingly have the capital to throw armies at the thing, the same isn't true of every team.</p><p dir="ltr">The cadence of releases under the Destiny banner have seemed increasingly exhaustive on the workforce producing it, especially when factoring in the constant expectations for the next additions to the game to be bigger and better. The live-service treadmill isn't the only thing killing Destiny though. Paired with the mismanagement of the studio under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/longtime-bungie-boss-pete-parsons-announces-departure-after-two-decades/1100-6534197/">previous leadership</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bungie-employees-claim-toxic-corporate-culture-is-killing-the-studio-from-the-inside/1100-6531737/">toxic workplace culture</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">constant layoffs</a> and reinventions--some better than others--it's no surprise that Destiny's lineage is riddled with instability.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes that cadence of releases meant that game-changing updates like The Taken King would shake things up for the better. But just as often, it meant that the realities of developing such a big expansion for Destiny caught up with the team behind it. Things fell short. Other expansions like Rise of Iron or Beyond Light felt half-baked, even if they were well-intentioned. Seasons, which were introduced in Destiny 2, felt like a bit of triage that allayed many storytelling and content woes but opened up another can of worms entirely over the years due to repetitive tasks and the removal of seasonal content. Some system-level changes, like reworks to classes, were welcome while others, like the introduction of the Portal, were not. The gulf between Destiny releases has often left a lot to be desired and it has meant that for every two steps that Destiny appeared to take, it would constantly take one back.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568253"></a><figcaption>Destiny: The Taken King</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4568253-3947584-2022_twq_the_last_chance_compressed11.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Where does The Taken King fall into this, exactly? Well, it arguably set the bar pretty high for what Destiny releases should be, and though Bungie has lived up to that promise a few times over the 10-plus years it's worked on the series, these ambitions have made for just as many misses as there have been hits.</p><p dir="ltr">It established an unfortunate rhythm of Bungie amending its errors, showing unprecedented strength, and then showing how that hubris could just as easily be the studio's undoing. Like clockwork, Bungie has spent the last decade and change stepping on rakes and bouncing back better than ever only to further upset the balance of things in Destiny and inadvertently step on another five rakes, which only landed there by the studio's own actions.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unfair to place the blame for Destiny's unevenness on one its earliest and best expansions. It would be a mischaracterization of the DLC and the intent behind it. The Taken King isn't a stain on Destiny's legacy because it's too good. That's a ridiculous thing to propose. But it certainly did set the game and the team behind it on a trajectory that has, at the very least, proved untenable for the studio and the health of the game in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">So for all the good that Taken King did Destiny by saving it back then, it's hard to deny that it has made for a tough act to follow, and chasing it after its highs has indelibly marked the studio. It is simultaneously emblematic of the best Destiny would offer, and the lows it would constantly have to recover from.</p>

                <p>Between now and the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> next month, Battlefield Studios and its developers will be working to refine the game based on what was learned during the recent beta test. Players have already shared their responses to the beta with some bitingly funny memes, including some about the game's sniper flare. The Battlefield 6 team has seen those pics, and they think they're hilarious.</p><p>Battlefield 6 technical director Christian Buhl and senior console combat designer Matthew Nickerson recently spoke with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> about the upcoming release. When asked about the memes, Buhl admitted to laughing at them while also taking their points to heart.</p><p>"I saw those ... I thought it was hilarious," said Buhl. "Obviously, we needed to fix some things and tune some things, so it was funny to see players react in a humorous way to those things, but also great to get that feedback and say, 'We need to tune down snipers or we need to change the glints so it's not like…' you know? I saw those memes with the hillside just full of these giant glares."</p><p>Nickerson added that the design team shares the memes internally, and he praised the effort made by fans to address the issues of the game through humor.</p><p>"They're really, really funny, and they kind of magnify, 'Hey, we still have work to do,'" said Nickerson. "For example, with the sniper glint stuff, we knew it was too strong, so we stepped it back. We knew the bullet tracer effect was too strong, so we stepped it back ... At the end of the day, it keeps us honest. It keeps us, like, 'Hey, we still have work to do. There are things that players are, maybe, not vibing with or are vibing with in different capacities.' ... From a design standpoint and from the team, we love this stuff. The community is engaged; we are engaged."</p><p>In the same interview, Nickerson addressed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-battlefield-6-is-approaching-locked-vs-open-class-weapons/1100-6534752/" data-ref-id="1100-6534752"> the team's approach to open class weapons and locked weapons</a>, and shared the team's desire to let the players decide.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-coming-to-switch-2-with-new-multiplayer-modes/1100-6534692/" data-ref-id="1100-6534692">Super Mario Bros. Wonder is getting a Switch 2 Edition</a>, and now fans think Nintendo may have accidentally revealed Rosalina will become new playable character.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer for the Switch 2 version of Super Mario Bros. Wonder that premiered during the most recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">Nintendo Direct</a> focused on the addition of Bellabel Park, a collection of multiplayer minigames exclusive to the Switch 2 version where players can either team up or compete against each other. One eagle-eyed fan, <a href="https://x.com/DynamoSuperX/status/1966516009780539646" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DynamoSuperX on X</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-fans-spot-unannounced-character-in-mario-bros-wonder-switch-2-trailer?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c85b6db5e33600016f55c4&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), spotted a vs minigame icon at around the 2:00 minute mark in the trailer that clearly shows an image of Yoshi next to Rosalina, seemingly confirming her inclusion in the upcoming rerelease of the platformer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQNAdzmlauc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hQNAdzmlauc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rosalina isn't in the original version of the game. However, Nintendo did state during the trailer that there would be additional new content coming to the Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Bros. Wonder, but that it would share more details at a later date. It certainly seems like Rosalina might be one of the surprises Nintendo was looking to keep under wraps until closer to the game's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Her inclusion would make sense given Nintendo's all-in push for Super Mario Galaxy. Nintendo during its latest direct announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-and-super-mario-galaxy-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-october/1100-6534691/" data-ref-id="1100-6534691">remastered versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a> are coming this year and that the name of Universal's Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel, scheduled to release April 2026, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hits-theaters-in-april-2026-chris-pratt-returning-as-mario/1100-6534677/" data-ref-id="1100-6534677">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>. Rosalina was introduced in the first Super Mario Galaxy back in 2007, and fans can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/" data-ref-id="1100-6534724">preorder a physical version of Rosalina's storybook</a> from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Super Mario Bros. Wonder + Meet Up In Bellabel Park is slated to release in 2026, joining a growing collection of Switch games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-party-jamboree/" data-ref-id="5000-632917">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land/" data-ref-id="5000-538660">Kirby and The Forgotten Land</a> with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 Editions</a> that pack in exclusive content.</p>
