While GetMadz got to drive the boat in free roam, they said it was also accessible during an actual race.</p><p dir="ltr">There's actually a glimpse of this in-action in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/mario-kart-world-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465858/" data-ref-id="2300-6465858">Mario Kart World's reveal trailer</a>, when Birdo drives into a semi-truck in the middle of a race and then proceeds to plow over some fellow racers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475846" data-ratio="0.56234718826406" data-width="1636" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475846"></a><figcaption>A brief look at a truck in-action from Mario Kart World's reveal trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear how many of these special vehicles there might be or if there will be one for each type of terrain.

                <p>Call of Duty developer Pete Actipis, who is the game director on CoD: Warzone at Raven Software, has teased Activision's plans for the OG map, Verdansk, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-3-patch-notes-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-adds-major-movement-changes-camo-hub/2900-6387/" data-ref-id="2900-6387">just recently returned to the game</a>.</p><p>As many may recall, Warzone's original battle royale map was featured in the game from launch in March 2020 to December 2021. It was gone for years until its return earlier this month. Actipis told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Activision "brought Verdansk back for a reason."</p><p>"It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it," Actipis said. "So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there."</p><p>Actipis declined to get into specifics on Activision's plans and strategy for Warzone map rotation, but the developer did tease, "We love Verdansk."</p><p>Actipis added: "It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1170698227"

data-ref-id="1100-6530610">helped the game's player populations grow on Steam</a>. Actipis said the return of Verdansk has been "pretty successful" so far. Actipis pointed to Warzone having positive sentiment on Reddit as an example of how the company has turned things around to a degree at least.</p><p>"Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it," Actipis said. "We recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going."</p><p>Beyond Warzone, a new Call of Duty game is expected to release in 2025, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">could be a Black Ops 2 sequel</a>. It'll face stiff competition in the market, as Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is coming this fall.

                <p>The Advance Wars lookalike tactics game Warside, developed by Lavabird and published by First Break Labs, is out now on PC. However, fans have pointed out that it's buggy and seemingly unfinished, reflecting its Mostly Negative reception so far.</p><p>Warside looks eerily similar, if not almost identical, to Advance Wars. The maps, buildings, battles, and troops look very much like the ones in Nintendo's tactics franchise. The biggest differentiator is that the Commanders in Warside have a more realistic pixel art as opposed to Advance Wars' anime art style.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2368300/Warside/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews section</a>, there are several features and gameplay mechanics that are missing. One player said that Warside feels like an early access release, with multiplayer lobbies and local multiplayer functionality nowhere to be found, even though both features were advertised as available.</p><p>Another player noted that the game's economy is broken as income needed to purchase troops is unavailable. However, it seems like the developers have already quickly fixed that issue.</p><p>Warside isn't the only game that's attempting to capture the spirit of the Game Boy Advance era, as the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-classic-fire-emblem-inspired-rpg-launches-in-march/1100-6529734/" data-ref-id="1100-6529734">Dark Deity 2</a> is inspired by Fire Emblem games from that period.</p><p>Warside currently has a 10% launch discount and will be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox at a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/warside-launches-april-14-for-pc-later-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-switch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">later date</a>.</p>
