                <p>Despite saying that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-wont-have-any-more-playtests-until-its-october-launch/1100-6533855/">wasn't planning to have any more playtests for Arc Raiders</a>, it looks like developer Embark Studios is ready to recruit people for one more weekend of action in its extraction shooter. The studio will host a Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it's aiming to stress-test its servers before the game officially launches later this month.</p><p>This open weekend will allow players to explore the Dam Battlegrounds and experience "elements of progression and crafting" while completing a set of quests, Embark Studios said. One thing to note here is that progress will not carry over from the Slam Test, but participating players will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for the full game.</p><p>This will be open to everyone aged 16 and older, so you won't need a download key or an invite to get an early taste of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/news/">Arc Raiders</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4572048"></a><figcaption>The exclusive backpack that can be unlocked by participating in the stress test.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4572048-arc-raiders-backpack.jpg"></figure><p>Earlier this year, it looked like there'd be a showdown between extraction shooters as Arc Raiders was scheduled to launch in close proximity to Bungie's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/">Marathon</a>.

                <p>This past weekend saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new battle royale mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-chaotic-delulu-mode-what-you-need-to-know-about-proximity-chat-battle-royale/1100-6534895/" data-ref-id="1100-6534895">Delulu</a>. A take on Fortnite's familiar formula, the catch here is that you can talk to anyone--whether squaded up or not--thanks to the new proximity chat. While this adds a nice layer of sociality to the game, it's also resulted in an increase in discrimination and harassment, which led to developer Epic Games banning "thousands" of accounts before the weekend closed out.</p><p>Delulu is exactly what you think it would be if you're familiar with both Fortnite and internet slang. Cutesy shorthand for "delusional," this new mode sees you potentially team up with--and likely betray, as there can only be one winner--anyone you see thanks to proximity chat. As you near another player, you can form a sort of temporary group chat to strategize as you play. This seems like it could be a fabulous idea, particularly for players who tend to play solo but still want to coordinate.</p>

                <p>Valve has previously implemented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-creates-new-security-measure-after-malware-attack-affected-steam-games/1100-6518359/" data-ref-id="1100-6518359">security measures on Steam</a> to protect players from malware and bad actors. However, it appears another instance of malware being distributed via a Steam game update has occurred, and it may have had dire consequences for at least one player.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">G Data</a>, the 2D side-scrolling game BlockBlasters had an update on August 30 that included malware that can steal personal information from any PC that the game is running on.

But he's just one victim, and it's unclear how many other users were infected by BlockBlasters. The game is no longer listed on Steam, which appears to indicate that Valve is now aware of the issue. Third-party tracking site <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> has labeled the game as "suspicious."</p><p>Earlier this year, Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-removes-steam-game-for-spreading-malware-sends-players-warning-about-security-concerns/1100-6529526/" data-ref-id="1100-6529526">removed a game called PirateFi</a> for also being filled with malware and issued a warning to every player that downloaded it. PirateFi players <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3476470/?curator_clanid=4777282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have dodged a bullet</a> when the game wouldn't run. BlockBlasters players may not be as lucky, and it may mean that Steam users will have to be more wary unless Valve has a way of preventing this from happening.</p>
