                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been one of 2025's breakout success stories in gaming, and it was developed on a relatively small budget, apparently.</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html?searchResultPosition=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reports</a> that the budget was "less than $10 million," crediting the information to developer Sandfall. The report added that the team "conserved resources" by purposefully avoiding an open-world setup in favor of making Expedition 33 a turn-based game.</p><p>Sandfall's Guillaume Broche said Sandfall now has the right technology to "make those games with a relatively small team," and he hopes to see more like it from other studios.</p><p>"Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early," he said.</p><p>Broche did not elaborate as to what technology specifically he was referring to as it relates to being able to embrace new systems to build games on a smaller budget. GameSpot has contacted Sandfall for further details on Expedition 33's budget.</p><p>Independent developer Billy Basso, who made Animal Well, said he hopes to see "more straightforward games" in the future. "You don't need to fill your game with hundreds of hours of checklist content," Basso said.</p><p>Expedition 33 was also notable for its relatively lower price point, as the game sells for $50 instead of the $70 or more that many other games ask. Some industry-watchers have theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">AAA games are becoming unsustainable</a> due in part to their larger budgets, and in turn, the requirement that they sell lots of copies to make their money back.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a "core team" of about 30 people, the report said, with battle animations outsourced to a studio in Korea. Sandfall also worked with other external teams on things like marketing and localization. The game's credits list <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/241065/clair-obscur-expedition-33/credits/windows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hundreds of people</a> who worked on the game, and this has led some to question if the game should have received a nomination for "Best Independent Game" game at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Previous estimates</a> suggested the game's budget was as much as $25 million.</p><p>The game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">sold more than 5 million copies</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-breaks-game-pass-records/1100-6536666/" data-ref-id="1100-6536666">broke Xbox Game Pass records.</a> It's nominated for 12 awards at The Game Awards, including overall Game of the Year, and that's the most nominations for any game in the show's history.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>

                <p>Just one day after Bethesda released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the publisher admitted the new version has performance problems. Players called the port a "disaster," and many more reported major input lag and a locked 30 frames per second.</p><p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-investigating-skyrim-switch-2-performance-issues-as-fans-brand-latest-port-a-disaster" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, the details of the lag became apparent when someone posted the delay between moving the Joy-Con stick and his character reacting in the game. "There's like a whole second between me flicking the stick and my character moving its head." </p><p>The discussion evolved into comparing Skyrim's Switch 2 version to Cyberpunk 2077, which runs at 40 frames per second on the same hardware while showing more detailed worlds. Another common complaint is the game's size: Skyrim takes up 53GB of the Switch 2's limited internal storage, even though it uses only 25GB on PC. For many fans, this raised questions about how the port was handled.</p><p>On Bethesda's official support site, the company <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/57181" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a mouthful of a question</a> titled "Why am I experiencing frame rate issues with The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim following the Anniversary Edition update on Nintendo Switch?" Bethesda responded by saying it is investigating the situation, but has not found solutions as of yet.</p><p>"We are investigating reports of performance issues on Nintendo Switch with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim after the Anniversary Edition update," and told players to subscribe to the article for updates. "In addition, you can provide feedback and information regarding on this topic via the <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/home/product/373/skyrimcat/287" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Feedback form</a>."</p><p>The Anniversary Edition is priced at $60, and players who own the older Switch version can pay $20 to upgrade and use it on both consoles. The edition includes the base game and the expansions Dawnguard, Dragonborn, and Hearthfire, along with improvements on Switch 2 such as enhanced resolution, faster loading, performance boosts, Joy-Con 2 mouse support, motion controls, Amiibo support, and other upgrades.</p>

<p>Carofano said Skyrim is a "great game" and the goal in releasing the game in so many places is to help it reach more people "in the best way possible."</p><p>He also discussed bringing Skyrim to Switch 2, saying there is a "whole new generation" of people who might pick up a Switch 2 and "that's the first time they've ever played Skyrim."</p><p>Bethesda previously put Skyrim on the original Switch, so creating a native Switch 2 version was "really an easy development process" and a "pretty quick" job to do, at least compared to Bethesda's traditional development timelines.</p><p>"Making the game takes years and years and years, but bringing it to this new console was a much, much faster process," he said.</p><p>The developer went on to discuss the ways in which Bethesda took advantage of the Switch 2 hardware.</p><p>"A lot of it was really just focusing on taking advantage of the new hardware. We can use DLSS now and get better resolution, better performance, and the game loads faster," he said. "Switch 2 has the Joy-Con 2 controllers that let you use mouse controls, so we added that. A lot of it is really just, 'How do we take advantage of the Switch 2? What can it do? And [how can we] give players the best version of Skyrim for that console?'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIntv_QfQjU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIntv_QfQjU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Skyrim for Switch 2 launched this week and people quickly discovered numerous issues, including input delay.

He said, "If you want us to stop releasing it, stop buying it." Skyrim was originally released in 2011 for PS3, Xbox 360, and PC, before coming to PS4 and Xbox One in 2016, then Nintendo Switch in 2017, and then PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2021. The Switch 2 edition launched on December 9.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who already own the Anniversary Edition on the original Switch, the Switch 2 upgrade for Skyrim is available for free. Those who don't already own any version of Skyrim on Switch can buy it on Switch 2 for $60. Owners of the non-Anniversary Edition of Skyrim on Switch can upgrade to the Anniversary Edition for $20 and then receive the Switch 2 version for free. The Anniversary Edition includes the base game and its three official expansions, as well as access to Creation Club content made by players.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyrim has sold more than 60 million copies and ranks as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top 10 best-selling games of all time</a>.

Part of the game's enduring popularity comes from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">Skyrim's vibrant mod scene</a>, where players are always creating new content that can transform the world Bethesda created in surprising ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Bethesda is currently working on Skyrim's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, which was announced in 2018 but does not have a release date.
