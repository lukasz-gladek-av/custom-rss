                <p>Last week, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">sweeping layoffs and restructuring efforts</a>, much of which targeted the tech giant's Xbox division. Multiple games were canceled and projects defunded, and thousands of workers were let go. This move induced widespread condemnation and an outpouring of sadness from the industry, including from EA Japan's general manager, Shaun Noguchi.</p><p>Noguchi, writing in his personal capacity, <a href="https://x.com/SeptillionGames/status/1940932053299876351" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted</a> on X about how disappointed he was to see more waves of layoffs and cancellations. He wrote (in Japanese and translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-japan-gm-speaks-out-on-microsoft-layoffs-and-cancellation-of-games-like-everwild-and-perfect-dark-if-a-game-was-in-development-for-710-years-canceling-feels-like-the-worst-move" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>) about how the trend in Western companies to chase short-term profits and reduce long-term payoffs or stability has led to damaging the game industry as a whole. "The game industry is held up by every single creator and member of staff who diligently develops games on the ground," he wrote. "As someone in the same industry, I feel deep pain regarding this decision."</p><p>He later <a href="https://x.com/SeptillionGames/status/1941631379411976521" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reiterated</a> (in English) that Microsoft's decision to kill off projects that had been in the works for many years was deeply regrettable. Although companies justify canceling projects to cut losses and avoid the sunk-cost fallacy, Noguchi expressed specific concern for the staff who would have nothing public to show for their work. "This is just my personal opinion but if a game was in development for 7~10 years, canceling feels like the worst move. That's a decade of work, potentially a quarter of someones [sic] entire career completly [sic] lost," he argued. "Even if the final product isn't what people originally expected, I think it still deserves to ship. Something is better than nothing for both the team and for the players."</p><p>Noguchi's comments may be informed by Japan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-president-takes-50-pay-cut/1100-6326055/" data-ref-id="1100-6326055">culture</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-are-japanese-developers-not-undergoing-mass-layoffs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">legal regime </a>that both emphasize corporate continuity and enforce strong protections for workers. Japanese developers have seemingly undergone much fewer contractions than Western developers in recent years, and it's not at all uncommon for Japanese workers to stick with one employer for their entire career.</p><p>Noguchi's employer, as a United States-based corporation, has been a high-profile participant in laying off staff and canceling games over the past few years. At the end of May, EA canceled its Black Panther game and laid off staff; this followed EA's reported cancellation of a Titanfall game and laying off of 300 people back in April.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, it's reasonable to expect that Nintendo might make a few policy changes to better reflect the company's intentions for the console. At least one of those changes comes with a cost, however: the Nintendo Switch Game Voucher program will be discontinued (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-for-this-great-nintendo-switch-game-de/1100-6468736/" data-ref-id="1100-6468736">permanently this time</a>) on January 30, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch Game Voucher initiative allowed Switch owners to essentially pre-pay for two Nintendo Switch games--so long as they were <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/?srsltid=AfmBOoqBUETKdbeFodjuwuZJG0ArxVxXn91WyMjd4epmGfhgH22e08Bl#sort=df&amp;p=0">included in the program</a>--through the purchase of two Game Vouchers; the vouchers cost $100, while two games purchased separately would normally cost $120. Many of Nintendo's first-party releases--including Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, were included in the program.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7piZNI98ODk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/70933/kw/vouchers" rel="nofollow ">official Nintendo support site</a> made the discontinuation of the program official, saying that "as of 11:59 PM Pacific Time January 30, 2026, it will no longer be possible to purchase Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers." The post does mention, however, that any vouchers purchased between now and the end of the program will be redeemable for 12 months after the date of purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">"There will be no change to the way your game vouchers expire. Game vouchers remain valid for 12 months from purchase," the statement reads. "For example, if a set of Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers is purchased on January 30, 2026, each Nintendo Switch Game Voucher remains valid until January 30, 2027."</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Nintendo confirmed that vouchers purchased through the program<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-switch-2-games-dont-support-nintendos-game-voucher-program/1100-6532158/"> would not be able to purchase games for Nintendo Switch 2</a>. As of now, there is no replacement program on the new console.</p>
