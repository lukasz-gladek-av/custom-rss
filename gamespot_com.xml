                <p dir="ltr">Valve is currently working on a sequel to the Steam Controller, along with a controller for its Deckard VR headset, according to spatial computing expert and unofficial Valve oracle Brad Lynch, whose datamining frequently <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859475336951460296" rel="nofollow ">uncovers interesting details on Valve products</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Lynch, both the Steam Controller 2 (codenamed "Ibex") and a controller for the currently unconfirmed Deckard VR headset--aptly codenamed "Roy," an homage to Blade Runner's renegade Replicant, <a href="https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_Batty" rel="nofollow ">Roy Batty</a>--are under development at Valve. Per Lynch, both products are reportedly "being tooled for a mass production goal in [Valve's] factories right now."</p><p dir="ltr">"That’s why I know they’re in later stages of productization," <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" rel="nofollow ">Lynch added</a> in a post on Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">But Lynch was also quick to point out that "being tooled for a mass production goal" does not mean "currently being assembled at a factory." He noted that <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859291136520536356" rel="nofollow ">it could be up to a year before the controllers begin the process of mass production</a>, but his datamining efforts have left him feeling confident that Ibex, Deckard, and Roy are all legitimate products that Valve will soon bring to market.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of Lynch's datamining appears to have revealed the inputs for the "Roy" controller, which appears to be highly customizable.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Datamining SteamVR’s client gave us deeper info of every input that is currently assigned to Valve’s Roy VR controllers</p><p>Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/ShinyQuagsire?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShinyQuagsire</a> ! ❤️</p><p>(Touch means a button has capacitive sensing)</p><p>All inputs assigned to Roy:</p><p>Left Hand Controller:</p><p>#… <a href="https://t.co/Ggyk03HEog" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/Ggyk03HEog</a></p></div>  — Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1859362627169698237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Valve, for its part, has neither confirmed nor denied Lynch's findings.</p><p dir="ltr">When Valve debuted the original Steam Controller in 2015, it was an ambitious attempt to bridge the gap between console-style controllers and the precision of a mouse and keyboard. Its defining feature was its dual trackpads, which provided a then-unprecedented level of customizability for controller input. The Steam Controller's design was polarizing: Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/grye8u/when_did_you_realize_you_fell_in_love_with_the/" rel="nofollow ">praised its innovation</a>, while others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/47t05o/support_guys_wtf_this_thing_sucks/" rel="nofollow ">found it difficult to use</a>, especially for more traditional gaming experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, the Steam Controller was instrumental in furthering Valve’s vision for SteamOS, the Linux-based operating system designed to run on Steam Machines, which themselves struggled to gain traction in the market. However, Valve’s move to focus on the Steam Link, Steam Deck, and <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/cloudgaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Cloud Gaming</a> ultimately left the Steam Controller largely forgotten, relegated to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamController/comments/1fl59cz/absolutely_in_love_with_the_steam_controller/" rel="nofollow ">niche community of loyal enthusiasts</a>.</p><p>The Steam Controller 2 represents a chance for Valve course-correct, addressing previous shortcomings while capitalizing on new technologies and gaming trends. But Valve's not the only company working on a new Steam-focused controller--Hori recently unveiled its new Steam controller, known as the Wireless Horipad for Steam, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horis-official-steam-controller-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon-ahead-of-holiday-release/1100-6527594/">currently available for preorder</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">From Software has become synonymous with challenging and beautifully crafted action-RPGs, and for Black Friday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09743F8P6?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get the studio's very best game for just $20</a>. Elden Ring typically sells for $60, and while we have seen it discounted several times in the past, this is the best price yet for an incredible adventure that'll test your skills within its elegantly tragic fantasy world.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamespot-10-10-review-score/2900-153/" data-ref-id="2900-153">Only 29 games have earned a 10/10 score</a> across GameSpot's long history, and Elden Ring is one of them. Back in 2022, Elden Ring was praised for creating a massive open-world environment with substance and giving players an action-packed experience that has become the gold standard for all Souls-likes.</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Hardware</a></li></ul><p dir="ltr">"In a genre that has become wrought with bloated and over-designed games, Elden Ring is defiantly contrarian in almost every way. Its commitment to design by subtraction and to placing the responsibility of charting a path through its world entirely on the player makes it stand head and shoulders above other open-world titles," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring review</a>. "Elden Ring takes the shards of what came before and forges them into something that will go down in history as one of the all-time greats: a triumph in design and creativity, and an open-world game that distinguishes itself for what it doesn't do as much as what it does."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for the complete experience, you can also pick up Elden Ring with its one and only expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree. The expansion was released earlier this year and adds an absurd amount of extra content, like new weapons, equipment, skills, and magic not found in the base game, alongside new enemies, encounters, and plotlines.

                <p>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the latest in the beloved RPG series, and the second to star new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. If you haven't caught up with the latest misadventures of everyone's favorite big-hearted dumbass, now is a great time, as Amazon has it for $25 (marked down from $70) for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The Like A Dragon series is the new title for the former Yakuza series, which shifted with the release of Ichiban's debut in Yakuza: Like A Dragon. That game also shifted the series to feature turn-based RPG combat, as opposed to the Yakuza series' action-oriented approach. Infinite Wealth brings back the turn-based combat, but with a new twist that adds free movement as well.</p><p>Infinite Wealth tells the story of Ichiban trying to help former Yakuza members reform and get their lives together after the dissolution of several Yakuza clans. Like previous games, it takes place mostly in Japan, but this time, it also has Ichi building up a community in Honolulu City, Hawaii.</p><p>For even more great deals on games, movies, collectibles, and more, be sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">all of our Black Friday coverage</a>.</p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3AT6I6s" rel="nofollow ">Black Friday Gaming Deals at Amazon</a>:</p><ul><li><a href="https://amzn.to/40YzOMn" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo Switch</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CCklYp" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3CEO4zK" rel="nofollow ">Xbox</a></li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4135foZ" rel="nofollow ">PC Accessories</a> | <a href="https://amzn.to/4eG3Tn1" rel="nofollow ">PC Hardware</a></li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">As we enter end-of-the-year award season, superstar Post Malone has revealed his current favorite game--Hunt: Showdown. The musician geeked out about the FPS with the game's creative director, calling it "the best game."</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/its-the-best-game-post-malone-reveals-he-has-nearly-400-hours-in-hunt-showdown-proving-the-songwriter-has-impeccable-fps-taste/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Malone appeared in a video (seen below) with Hunt: Showdown creative director Scott Lussier on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CywILj8E8rM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's YouTube channel</a>. The musician explained that his buddy turned him onto Hunt: Showdown, and he's loved it ever since. "Whenever I'm on the road and can't play, I'm always missing it," Malone said. "And I've got about 400 hours on it."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CywILj8E8rM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CywILj8E8rM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Malone noted that he liked how "you can body somebody in one shot" in Hunt: Showdown, as well as offering guns and skins that are "so sick." The Grammy Award-nominated musician--behind hits like "White Iverson," "Sunflower," and "Rockstar"--basically implied it blew his mind when he first tried out "Necro" in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Malone has expressed his video game love or been associated with a big-name game. For instance, last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-x-post-malone-event-features-new-ltm-themed-cosmetics/1100-6518852/" data-ref-id="1100-6518852">Apex Legends partnered with Malone for a special in-game event</a>, including skins based on the musician. Then, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbones-new-translucent-controller-is-a-very-unexpected-crossover/1100-6524272/" data-ref-id="1100-6524272">Backbone released a limited-edition Post Malone controller</a>. Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/post-malone-now-holds-the-one-ring-of-power-magic-the-gathering-card/1100-6516474/" data-ref-id="1100-6516474">Malone is clearly a Lord of the Rings nerd</a>, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hunt-showdown-is-having-its-best-day-ever-on-steam-following-ambitious-1896-update/1100-6525834/" data-ref-id="1100-6525834">Hunt: Showdown had its best day ever on Steam</a> in August after the launch of the 1896 update. Developer Crytek overhauled the shooter's visuals and ended support for Xbox One and PS4, though players got free upgrades to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hunt-showdown-gets-its-first-crossover-character-with-this-legendary-horror-villain/1100-6527323/" data-ref-id="1100-6527323">the game got its first crossover character with Scream's Ghost Face</a>. Hunt: Showdown first launched on Steam Early Access in 2018.</p>
