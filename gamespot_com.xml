It might not be called that, but Nintendo is gearing up to announce a new console, and a key piece of information about the system was just revealed: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/#:~:text=X%7CS%20Games-,Switch%202%20Will%20Play%20Switch%201%20Games%2C%20Nintendo%20Confirms,later%20date%20on%20this%20feature." data-ref-id="1100-6527598">It'll be backwards-compatible</a>, meaning it will be able to play Nintendo Switch games. In this post, we're rounding up everything we know, and don't know, about Switch 2's backwards compatibility.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Can_you_play_Switch_games_on_Switch_2_">Can you play Switch games on Switch 2?</a></li><li><a href="#Unknowns">Unknowns</a><ul><li><a href="#Do_physical_Switch_game_cards_work_with_Switch_2_">Do physical Switch game cards work with Switch 2?</a></li><li><a href="#Are_all_Switch_games_backwards_compatible_">Are all Switch games backwards compatible?</a></li><li><a href="#Does_Switch_2_improve_Switch_games_">Does Switch 2 improve Switch games?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Stock_price_jump">Stock price jump</a></li><li><a href="#Switch_2_game_store_and_Nintendo_Switch_Online">Switch 2 game store and Nintendo Switch Online</a></li><li><a href="#Becoming_the_norm">Becoming the norm</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Can_you_play_Switch_games_on_Switch_2_"><strong>Can you play Switch games on Switch 2?</strong></h2><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/241106e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's earnings presentation in early November 2024</a>, president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed the news, stating, "Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch." The Switch 2 being able to play Switch 1 games was rumored, but Furukawa made it official during the earnings briefing.</p><p>The Switch was not compatible with Wii U games, but a number of Wii U games were ported to the Switch. For this next transition, however--from Switch to Switch 2--existing software will be supported.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4395620" data-ratio="0.55316285329744" data-width="743" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4395620"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 is backwards compatible with Switch 1</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4395620-screenshot2024-11-06at1.54.06pm.png"></figure><h2 id="Unknowns"><strong>Unknowns</strong></h2><p>Nintendo's announcement of backward compatibility support for Switch 2 was light on details. It is presently unknown how it'll all work. Below are some key unanswered questions.</p><h3 id="Do_physical_Switch_game_cards_work_with_Switch_2_">Do physical Switch game cards work with Switch 2?</h3><p>One of the unknowns is whether or not backwards compatibility is limited to digital games or if the Switch 2 will also support physical Switch cartridges. Since the Switch 2 hasn't even been announced yet, we don't know what format the system might have for physical media, or if it supports it at all.</p><h3 id="Are_all_Switch_games_backwards_compatible_">Are all Switch games backwards compatible?</h3><p>We also don't know if the backwards compatibility will be comprehensive or limited, but this should become clear in time. For now, Furukawa said Nintendo will share more information "at a later date." For what it's worth, even within the Switch 1 ecosystem, not all games were universally supported. As an example, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-games-that-dont-work-on-switch-lite/1100-6495185/" data-ref-id="1100-6495185">Switch Lite didn't support certain Switch games.</a></p><h3 id="Does_Switch_2_improve_Switch_games_">Does Switch 2 improve Switch games?</h3><p>The Switch 2 is expected to be a more powerful machine than the existing Switch, which launched in 2017 and has sold more than 146 million units to date. But whether or not the Switch 2 will improve original Switch games played on it is unknown. When a system offers backward compatibility, like with PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, it is often the case that games for the older system look and perform better on the newer one with better resolutions and/or frame rates. That's at least something that Nintendo fans would probably hope for with the Switch 2. Games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom, and Echoes of Wisdom were highly regarded games, but also had notoriously bad performance in certain spots, and the Switch 2 offering improvements would be very welcome.</p><p><span>We will update this post as more information comes to light.</span></p><h2 id="Stock_price_jump">Stock price jump</h2><p>The Switch 2, or whatever it's going to be called, hasn't even been announced yet, but Nintendo's stock price jumped after Nintendo announced the backwards compatibility news.</p><p>Analyst Dr. Serkan Toto said investors might have taken the announcement of backwards compatibility to mean the Switch 2 is more of a "continuation" rather than a "risky experiment," and that could have helped the share price grow. The thinking here is that the Switch 2 being backwards-compatible could help encourage people to buy it because they know their games will move with them and they won't have to start over.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Nintendo stock just closed up +5.80% (3:30pm Japan time on Wed) because of the confirmed backwards compatibility of the next console with the current Switch.<br>Investors think this is a sign Nintendo's next device will not be a risky experiment but rather a continuation. <a href="https://t.co/hB2PUkg9AF" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/hB2PUkg9AF</a></p>  â€” Dr. Serkan Toto (@serkantoto) <a href="https://twitter.com/serkantoto/status/1854050495566061608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><h2 id="Switch_2_game_store_and_Nintendo_Switch_Online"><strong>Switch 2 game store and Nintendo Switch Online</strong></h2><p>Nintendo also stated that people who buy a Switch 2 "will be able to choose their next purchase from a broad selection of titles released for Nintendo Switch." This seems to suggest that the Switch 2's games store will also include original Switch games.</p><p>Beyond all of this, Nintendo said the Switch 2 will support Nintendo Switch Online and your existing Nintendo Account. "We believe that it is important for Nintendo's future to make use of Nintendo Account and carry over the good relationship that we have built with the over 100 million annual playing users on Nintendo Switch to its successor," Furukawa said.</p><h2 id="Becoming_the_norm"><strong>Becoming the norm</strong></h2><p>There was a time in the video game industry when new console generations represented something of a clean slate, and consumers had to start over and purchase new games for the new device. But those days are becoming a relic of the past, for Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony.</p><p>The Xbox Series X|S supports Xbox One games (and some Xbox 360 and original Xbox games), while the PS5 supports PS4 titles, along with PS3 and PS2 games by way of streaming, and only for a certain selection of titles. It's not backwards-compatibility in the traditional sense of popping your old Xbox or PlayStation disc into the new machine. Instead, this was made possible through the video game industry's push towards digital. Many digital games purchased for one platform carry forward to the next, and now Nintendo--which has also seen dramatic increases in digital game sales--is joining the fold with Switch 2.</p><p>That's all we know for now, but with the Switch 2 set to be announced by the end of March 2025, more details should come to light in due course.
