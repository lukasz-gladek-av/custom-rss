                <p>Battlefield 6's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">record-breaking</a> first open beta has come and gone, and now the developers are starting to sift through player feedback and bug reports. One of the issues in the crosshairs is the reported "super bullet" causing unexpectedly fast time-to-kill rates.</p><p>BF6's principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took to X</a> following the end of the open beta to ask players for videos of "suspected super bullet/unexpectedly fast TTD" bugs. A number of players have reported having this issue in the Battlefield beta, with some streamers even experiencing the issue live on stream. The unusually quick TTD (time to death or time to down) bug causes some players to be downed in just a few shots, and sometimes even when behind cover.</p>

<p>Players were quick to provide examples of the suspected bug, with some speculating that the server was slow to apply damage that had already been received, causing the full amount of damage to be applied to the player all at once after a short delay. Players have also reported taking damage or failing to heal when they should be at full health, including immediately after respawning--though this bug appears to only impact the health-bar UI and not players' actual hit points.</p><p>While some player's TTD issues were put down to regular lag due to a poor internet connection, others have shared videos of the suspected bug in question. Le Bihan later updated to thank players for sharing their footage, saying he's now been sent "a bunch of good videos" to investigate the issue.</p><p>With the first open-beta weekend concluded, players have taken to social media to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">share their thoughts on the preview</a>, both good and bad. The beta reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-reportedly-reached-a-massive-player-count/1100-6533862/" data-ref-id="1100-6533862">huge number of people</a>, and the developers at DICE no doubt have a big job ahead of them combing through player feedback and bug reports ahead of the game's release on October 10.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p>

Now, it may reach even further heights because Lady Gaga is coming to Dress to Impress for a special event this week.</p><p>Under the rules of Dress to Impress, players are invited to create outfits based on specific themes, and the top three winners are chosen by votes from other players. For this event, the theme is Mayhem, the most recent album from Lady Gaga.</p><p>Starting on August 16, players will be able to compete in Mayhem-themed challenges and earn Lady Gaga-related items and clothing. Style Showdown will also feature a challenge based on Lady Gaga's song Zombieboy. A lucky few may even get a chance to meet Lady Gaga in-game as she judges an outfit competition for herself.</p><p>Outside of the Lady Gaga event, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-codes/1100-6533105/" data-ref-id="1100-6533105">an assortment of free outfits and accessories</a> that can be claimed by Dress to Impress players in August.

                <p>The saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> has played out in the court of public opinion this summer, and now it's taken another step towards an actual courtroom. Krafton has officially responded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders</a> Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as former CEO Ted Gill--all three of whom were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>.</p><p>Cleveland and his team have accused Krafton of delaying Subnautica 2 in order to prevent the publisher from paying Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-unknonw-worlds-delay-steam-2000617210" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Krafton's response accuses the co-founders of valuing the $250 million bonus over delivering a more complete version of Subnautica 2. The filing goes even further and states that the co-founders were fired to prevent them "from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds' most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans."</p><p>The $250 million bonus was supposed to be paid out to Unknown Worlds if the company met certain financial goals in 2025, which would be almost impossible if Subnautica 2 doesn't get an early-access release this year. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting those benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of the bonus would have gone to the former leadership team.</p><p>Krafton's complete <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to the lawsuit is online</a>, and it paints a picture of the co-founders attempting to rush Subnautica 2 into early access while simultaneously remaining hands-off on the actual production. The filing also states that, "Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only Subnautica 2, but also Subnautica 3, Subnautica 4, and any other future Subnautica franchise product."</p><p>Subnautica 2 is currently set to have its early-access release in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>There were some severe consequences for BioWare last year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> stumbled out of the gate and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a>. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off a lot of BioWare's staff</a> and left a much smaller team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. But there may be a silver lining to that, according to former BioWare employee Mark Darrah.</p><p>Darrah--who served as an executive producer on the first three Dragon Age games before leaving BioWare--recently joined <a href="https://youtu.be/1Pd9OG3HmN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a> and shared his belief that the remaining BioWare devs should "scapegoat" The Veilguard to get every resource they need from EA.</p><p>"To be frank, the Mass Effect team is going to be able to point to The Veilguard and say, 'We should steer away from some of these things, because look what happened,'" said Darrah. "I would honestly encourage that team to scapegoat Veilgard as much as they need to to get what they need from the organization, whether it's true or not."</p><p>During the same interview, Darrah recalled that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/" data-ref-id="1100-6533843">BioWare attempted to get a Dragon Age trilogy remaster off the ground</a>, but didn't get a favorable response from EA. The Veilguard went through a difficult development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">that included a shift to a live-service model</a> before it was redeveloped as a single-player game. Former BioWare employees have also said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams didn't get along</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect producer Mike Gamble recently teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-will-carry-over-a-piece-of-the-series-signature-style-apparently/1100-6532042/" data-ref-id="1100-6532042">the next game will maintain the series' signature lens flare</a>. The Mass Effect TV series in development at Prime Video also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-show-brings-on-one-of-its-most-important-creative-roles-report/1100-6532187/" data-ref-id="1100-6532187">recently added showrunner Doug Jung</a>.</p>
