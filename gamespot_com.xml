                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

                <p>This fall, visitors at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-our-first-look-at-the-nintendo-museum/1100-6526006/" data-ref-id="1100-6526006">Nintendo Museum</a> in Japan are going to get an opportunity to catch a glimpse of history from Nintendo's five decades in the video game industry. Nintendo Museum has announced that an art gallery will be opening on September 3 featuring "a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405684179693786" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Art Gallery will open on Wednesday, September 3rd on the 2nd floor of the Nintendo Museum Exhibition Building. Visitors can explore a wide range of game artwork, including character illustrations and concept art.</p>  — ニンテンドーミュージアム (@Museum_Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405684179693786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The announcement was light on details about what kind of artwork will be presented in the gallery, or how far back it will go. Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">GameSpot's two-day visit to the museum in 2024</a>, Dan Ryckert noted that it "is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum." He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise. In response to demand from around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-museum-puts-limits-on-gift-store-merch-to-discourage-scalpers/1100-6526911/" data-ref-id="1100-6526911">Nintendo Museum added limits to the merch that visitors can buy</a> in order to discourage scalpers. The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is quickly becoming one of my favorite games of 2025, despite it still feeling a smidge like it's in early access. The choice to transform the fantasy of playing football (soccer for the American folks!) from the traditionally tactical experience seen in most other football games into more of a high-action, mechanically complex throwdown with an emphasis on pulling off acrobatic plays and heroic saves is very cool. It's led to incredibly rewarding moments and crushing defeats, and riding the wave of those two extremes is a big reason why I enjoy games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a>. It's also why I love Blue Lock, a manga/anime often cited in comparison to Rematch.</p><p dir="ltr">"We did see A LOT of players referencing Blue Lock, more than we expected, actually!" Rematch creative director Pierre Tarno told me via email. "We didn't really know it was so popular--it wasn't a major inspiration for the game, though internally some of us do enjoy both manga and anime!"</p><p dir="ltr">For the unfamiliar, Blue Lock is about 300 Japanese high school football players getting locked away in a black site training facility overseen by the mysterious mastermind Jinpachi Ego. Ego tells the group they'll be put through a series of trials, all in hopes of honing one of them into the world's best striker--someone so egotistical that they'd sacrifice Japan's irresponsible emphasis on teamwork to selfishly score goals no matter what and lead the Japan national team to victory. The other 299 failures will never be allowed to play on any Japan team again, ending their football careers in the country.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521621"></a><figcaption>When Rematch was first announced, I remember immediately thinking it looked like Blue Lock.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521621-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A lot (and I do mean, <em>a lot</em>) of what you can do in Rematch is similar to what characters do in Blue Lock (who themselves are written to emulate the flashiest, most well-remembered traits of famous football players, turned up to 11). Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGDAX9Qty4E">Meguru Bachira</a>, you can master dribbling and fast step-overs to cut through the defense single-handed, only passing the ball to teammates who challenge your imagination of what you can do. Like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AW1jQQkZU9I">Seishirō Nagi</a>, you can pull off skillful ball takedowns and utilize misdirection, ball control, and acrobatic flair to become a goal-scoring genius. And like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0a6RXxjPpts">Shōei Barō</a>, you can intercept passes meant for teammates (or outright take the ball from them while they're trying to dribble), scoring the goal yourself to steal the show as the match's heel. The opening cinematic of Rematch might highlight the opposite values, but the <em>mechanics </em>of the game allow you to play with ego.</p><p dir="ltr">Even the rules and setting of Rematch emulate Blue Lock--one of the earliest (and fan-favorite) arcs focuses on 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 match-ups where every player is trying to score, there are no off-sides, and the high-tech facility that all the players are contained in verges on futuristic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521622"></a><figcaption>Pass? When the goal is right there? I don't think so.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521622-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A quick search for "Rematch Blue Lock" will reveal a ton of clips on TikTok and YouTube of people emulating the manga/anime by doing something really cool solo and not passing the ball to their teammates, even when the entire defense collapses upon them. And I can't count the number of times I've been up against or playing alongside someone who has used the character creator to make their player incredibly pale-skinned with short, stark-white hair and a black uniform sporting number 11 (like Nagi), or to give their tan-skinned player dark, medium-length hair with dyed yellow tips and a blue uniform with number 8 (like Bachira).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, not every person playing Rematch is doing so because they like Blue Lock. I'm sure most of them are like Richard Wakeling, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/">reviewed Rematch for GameSpot</a>, and came to Rematch because they loved playing the sport in real life (or are just fans of Sloclap's work!). But there is clearly a not-insignificant portion of the playerbase that is jumping into Rematch to embrace their egotistical Blue Lock fantasies and play the hero of the match who scores all the cool goals or pulls off clip-worthy dribbling.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521623"></a><figcaption>A lot of people in Rematch think they're Nagi.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521623-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet, despite all those clear parallels, Rematch is not developer Sloclap's attempt to emulate Blue Lock. It's not the team's attempt to emulate really any singular story centered around football.</p><p dir="ltr">"The setting and art direction really came from the pillars of the game, rather than from specific pieces of media," Tarno said. "Rematch is a game about the joy of playing football with your friends, about how individual talent is necessary but never sufficient, and at the end of the day, it’s the collective that matters. The focus on teamplay and positive sportsmanship is what drove our choices on setting and art direction: a colorful, positive vision of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Sloclap is hoping Rematch has a positive future itself, and the team is already working on updates to the game beyond the soon-to-come cross-play.</p><p dir="ltr">"Emergent strategies and mechanics started appearing [during the beta], but they consolidated during launch week," Tarno said. "Most of them are valid and should not be removed, but one exploit we'll be removing is the 'dolphin jump,' in which players exploit the outfield dive to move faster even when they've run out of stamina. We're considering advanced ways that could be used to optimize movement speed and stamina usage, but this one looks really weird and will be removed!"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521624"></a><figcaption>The goalkeeper deserves more options to stop the multitude of shots that strikers can take.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4521624-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much like other online multiplayer games that came before it, Rematch is evolving as more players jump in, and Sloclap has noted that its vision of Rematch may change to match players' expectations. That probably doesn't mean a Blue Lock crossover is coming (but we live in a post-Fortnite world, so who knows), but other aspects of the game are changing to reflect a shift in focus--such as the way 5v5 has ceased to be the "standard" mode, despite Sloclap setting it up to be the default way to play ranked matches.</p><p dir="ltr">"The initial vision we had for the game was a 5v5 experience, which features more tactical configurations, more challenge in making precise passes, and [more development of] your vision of the game dynamics," Tarno said. "The 3v3 game mode is very popular, however, and we're seeing a lot of players requesting a 3v3 ranked queue, so it's really a matter of taste for players."</p><p dir="ltr">On that, I agree with the herd. I know Sloclap wants 5v5 to be the experience for Rematch, but the game feels a lot more tactical and strategic when played on the tighter 3v3 and 4v4 fields, and it's easier for the player who's keeper/sweeper to call out the action, stay engaged, and feel useful on the smaller field.</p><p>Maybe just give the keeper the ability to pull off a last-ditch shachihoko fish kick to save the ball like Blue Lock's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GmwocGtH14">Gin Gagamaru</a>? That would be cool!</p>
