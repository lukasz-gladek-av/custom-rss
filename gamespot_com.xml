                <p>Blizzard Entertainment president Johanna Faries has said fans of the Diablo and Warcraft company can look forward to what she hopes will be Blizzard's "biggest year yet" in 2026.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and Faries<a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/blizzard-entertainment-president-blizzcon-2026-preview-1236610214/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> told Variety</a> that the company has a "bold vision" for what's coming next.</p><p>"The teams across Blizzard entirely, as an organization, are gearing up for what we hope to be the biggest year yet for Blizzard, and we take that statement very seriously," Faries said. "And it's all part of this new, bold vision for the future."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gpaz0etTqJw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Gpaz0etTqJw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Faries went on to say that Blizzard's teams "are cooking on major swings" for its major franchises, some of which will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/" data-ref-id="1100-6535959">discussed at BlizzCon 2026 in September of next year.</a></p><p>"I think we just have a tremendous amount of pride in what's going to come forward, not just at BlizzCon, but even in the run up to BlizzCon here. So all hands on deck, but it's a very exciting time," she said.</p><p>Finally, Faries said she wants Blizzard to be the "best gaming and entertainment company in the world," and what the company shows at BlizzCon next year aims to "really reflect that ambition in a bigger way."</p><p>"I have total confidence that the teams are going to come very, very big, both with the heart and soul of what I think our core-most fans long for in a BlizzCon, but also bringing some very new things to the table," she said.</p><p>Faries worked at the NFL for nearly 12 years before joining Activision to work on the Call of Duty series, rising to the rank of Call of Duty general manager. In February 2024, she <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-new-president-previously-oversaw-call-of-duty/1100-6520673/" data-ref-id="1100-6520673">became the president of Blizzard, replacing Mike Ybarra.</a></p><p>Officially speaking, Blizzard has said it has "major" reveals for the BlizzCon opening ceremony. Beyond that, the convention will see the return of the Blizzard Arcade, developer panels, and hands-on gameplay sessions for games like World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal. Presumably, these titles will have new content revealed for them, explaining their presence on the show floor.</p><p>In the semi-near future, Diablo IV's new expansion, Lord of Hatred, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-lord-of-hatred-brings-back-everyones-favorite-hot-mom-amazons-and-lorath/1100-6536976/" data-ref-id="1100-6536976">coming in April 2026 with everyone's favorite "hot mom."</a> World of Warcraft's new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight</a>, is coming in March 2026.</p><p>2026 also marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and Blizzard no doubt has some surprises in store. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Actor Neil Newbon, who voiced Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3, has shared his thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, and he didn't mince words.</p><p>"Fuck AI in performance," Newbon told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/baldurs-gate-3/astarion-neil-newbon-ai-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a>.</p><p>He's talking about using artificial voice lines for games, like how Embark's The Finals and Arc Raiders do. For Arc Raiders, the studio hired human actors to record voice lines and then used AI systems to have their voices say lots of other things. Newbon pointed out that Arc Raiders has been a major commercial success, and he suggested that Embark bring back the actors to "redo the lines."</p><p>"Maybe go back to those actors you paid however much money to clone their voices; maybe get them in the booth and re-record that stuff. Just saying. You've got the money now, spread the wealth," he said.</p><p>"I don't think there's a justification for taking people's jobs away," he added. "I don't really think it's legitimate. If you're going to not record the lines in the first place and just use AI to take somebody's voice and manipulate it however the hell you want, that's a problem."</p><p>"Most actors, notoriously, are not rich. Most of us struggle [for] our entire career," he said.</p><p>Embark has not disclosed the names of the voice performers in Arc Raiders, nor do we know their level of compensation. But Newbon said most actors are "not rich" and "struggle for our entire career."</p><p>Beyond all of this, Newbon said AI-created voice lines, as they exist today, simply sound "boring."</p><p>"It's dull as hell. I don't <em>believe</em> it; it takes me out of the immersion. People are saying it helps the immersion because it's reactive. It takes me out of the experience because I just hear something that doesn't sound like a human being in jeopardy, or in combat, or excitement, or whatever emotion you're supposed to be aiming for," he said.</p><p>Next up for Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian is a new Divinity game. The company's CEO, Swen Vincke, recently discussed how the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">uses AI technologies in early-stage development efforts</a>, but promised that nothing AI-created will appear in the final product. His comments caused a stir, prompting Vincke to respond, saying Larian is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">hiring more people, not fewer</a>, and that AI is used to explore possibilities and not for actual production.</p>

                <p>Two of the biggest zombie franchises are teaming up as World War Z's next story campaign DLC will cross over with The Walking Dead. Players will be able to take control of four of the iconic characters from the show--Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne--with The Walking Dead stars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus reprising their roles as Rick and and Daryl, respectively. The first trailer for the crossover should look very familiar to fans of both franchises.</p><p>The new episodic campaign will unfold over three stories that revisit locations from The Walking Dead, including Grady Memorial Hospital, the Prison, and the Alexandria Safe Zone. But don't count on facing The Walking Dead's infamously slow hordes of walkers. This DLC is pitting the characters against a new incarnation of World War Z's Zeke swarms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World War Z x The Walking Dead - DLC Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>There's also a fresh take on a Zeke called Spiked Walkers. This zombie is impervious to melee attacks unless it's been knocked over. However, the window of opportunity to take it out is short, and once it's back on its feet, it's no longer vulnerable.</p><p>As seen in the trailer, the signature weapons of each character are intact. Michonne has her katanas, Daryl's got a crossbow, and Negan's got "Lucille," a barbed wire bat that he's used on both the living and the dead. Rick has a revolver, but all of the characters can switch to heavy artillery when the situations call for it. And they will.</p><p>The World War Z x The Walking Dead DLC will debut in January 2026 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
