                                        <p dir="ltr">The Girls' Frontline series is back in a big way with the release of Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium—now available on PC and mobile! This free-to-play strategy RPG sequel builds on everything fans loved in the original game, now with a fully 3D battlefield, evolved mechanics, and a fresh roster of Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) ready for action.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a returning Commander or just starting out, Exilium offers a gorgeous, anime-inspired experience thanks to next-gen rendering tech, deep tactical gameplay, and a variety of mini-games to keep things fresh. It's everything you loved about the original and so much more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle-Ready T-Dolls Take the Spotlight</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326"></a><figcaption>Springfield and Peri are ready for action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest update brings new Elite T-Dolls to recruit, with increased drop-rates for Springfield, Peri, and Mechty (Rerun). Each brings their own strengths to your squad—and yes, you can deck them out in stylish outfits, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield, a powerhouse support unit, is perfect for Hydro-focused teams. Her ability to overheal and boost allies makes her an essential part of any strong lineup. She's available now in the limited-time Targeted Procurement banner, so if you've been hoarding Collapse Pieces and Targeted Access Permissions, now's your chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Pair her with the Radiance rifle: a custom Elite-class weapon designed just for her. It increases Hydro damage team-wide, boosts HP by 15%, and amplifies Springfield's key abilities. Based on the real-world M1903, this sleek rifle delivers both style and stopping power.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Peri Brings the Fire</h2><p dir="ltr">Peri–a Bulwark unit–is all about aggressive tactics. She dishes out Burn damage at the cost of her own HP, but can activate a powerful shield to stay in the fight longer. You can unlock her for free through the Standard Banner by completing event tasks during the current limited-time event.</p><p dir="ltr">Her signature weapon? A deceptively dainty SMG based on the MP5H1 that hits like a truck. And don't sleep on Faye—her elite handgun, Hestia, modeled after the CZ75, turns her into a true Goddess of Flame on the battlefield and is a portable powerhouse.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dress to Impress: Limited-Time Outfits</h2><p dir="ltr">What's a new T-Doll without a killer outfit? Several stunning looks are available at limited-time discounts:</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield's "Queen in Radiance" outfit isn't just elegant—it's also the first 3D main screen wallpaper in the game, complete with dance interactions and Scenic Tour animations.</p><p dir="ltr">Faye's "Flurry Crimson" ensemble channels her inner flame with dancer-inspired flair.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Style Up Your Arsenal</h2><p dir="ltr">Don't let your weapons feel left out, because new skins are here too! Springfield's Midnight Waltz pairs perfectly with her Radiance outfit for a dazzling ballroom blitz combo. And for a retro-futuristic edge, grab the Dawn Sentry, a stylish homage to old-school sci-fi.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Free Pulls, Codes, and a Shot at Real-World Prizes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328"></a><figcaption>Here's a closer look at all the rewards you can earn in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium is feeling generous this month, as you can grab 40 free banner pulls, the free T-Doll Faye, free Targeted Access Permissions, and more this month.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance to win prizes like the iPhone 16, Razer keyboard, and tons of in-game loot through the Defend Zucchero Café event.</p><p dir="ltr">Got a US server account?

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has laid off a number of employees at its Red Storm studio, which has most recently focused on a number of VR initiatives for the publisher, as well as supporting development on titles such as XDefiant.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tom-clancy-star-trek-bridge-crew-studio-ubisoft-red-storm-lays-off-19-citing-global-cost-saving-efforts" rel="nofollow ">reported by IGN</a>, Ubisoft has cut 19 jobs at Red Storm, citing "ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts" for its reasoning.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft released a full statement to IGN, which reads, "Today, Ubisoft made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment. This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft."</p><p dir="ltr">It is currently unclear how deep these cuts at Red Storm, which has become a VR and support studio over the last several years, go or how they will impact any ongoing projects at the team. Ubisoft PR confirmed to IGN though that this restructuring is not indicative of any larger cuts occurring at the French publisher or of its other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Storm, which was founded in 1996 and created stalwart franchises under the Tom Clancy banner such as the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series, most recently released Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which is exclusively available on Meta Quest 2 and above. Besides this release, which marks the long-running franchise's debut on virtual reality platforms, the studio has spent much of the last few years supporting games like XDefiant, which was shut down earlier this year, and working on a pair of canceled projects, including a canned Splinter Cell VR title and a free-to-play spin-off title in The Division series subtitled Heartland.</p><p dir="ltr">The former was axed back in 2022 while the latter lingered for a while longer--even being played in closed alpha tests--before being indefinitely delayed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">ultimately shelved</a> in 2024 amidst wider cuts at a tough time for the embattled publisher, which recently entered into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">partnership with Tencent</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A consumer rights watchdog in Brazil has launched a legal challenge against Nintendo for its policy of "bricking" the consoles of users who violate the console's terms of service. This policy is a new addition to Nintendo's user agreement. The change took effect on May 7, just a month before the Nintendo Switch 2 launched. Procon-SP, the São Paulo branch of the Brazilian Consumer Protection and Defense Program, has raised a complaint with Nintendo itself, claiming the policy violates consumer rights.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">IGN</a>, reports of "bricked" consoles have emerged since the Switch 2's launch. Affected users have speculated that bans result from the use of flash memory cards generally, and the MIG Switch device in particular, both of which can be used for piracy. A bricked console cannot access the internet and will display the error code 2124-4508. The ban encompasses paid online features like GameChat and online multiplayer, but also unpaid ones, like downloading patches or verifying Game-Key carts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, it is the console itself that is banned, not just the user account of the offender. This means that purchasing a Switch 2 secondhand could result in buying a "bricked" console, one that cannot access any of the console's online features. According to IGN, this has already happened. Nintendo has stated that such a ban is permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Procon-SP's statement</a>, Nintendo has agreed to respond to the claim within 20 days. The organization encourages Brazilian consumers to log their bans on the watchdog's official website while it waits on Nintendo's response.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, the company has responded to concerns that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-addresses-concerns-over-switch-2s-price-keeping-kids-from-getting-it/1100-6532994/">the console's price point would be a barrier to younger fans</a>. Nintendo is also considering <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-may-use-shorter-development-periods-on-some-games-to-offset-high-costs/1100-6532996/">shorter development times to offset growing costs</a>.</p>
