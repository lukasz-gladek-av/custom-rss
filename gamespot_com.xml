                <p>DICE has published a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1925204954978861553" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing some of its thoughts about the class system for the upcoming Battlefield game, and it includes bringing back a controversial feature from Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom, and DICE is sticking with it for the next Battlefield game.</p><p>In Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, DICE said it will allow for "fully customizable weapon loadouts" that give players the "freedom to play the way [they] want."</p><p>Each class will have signature weapons, however, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 launched with "Specialist" characters as opposed to the traditional class system. People generally did not like this, and DICE brought back the four traditional classes in a later update.</p><p>The developer also confirmed that each class in Battlefield 6 will have a signature trait that provides passive bonuses; a Recon player will be able to spot enemies while aiming down sights, for example. Classes have signature gadgets, too, and they are unique to each class with the aim of giving players what they need to "fulfill the role of that class."</p><p>"We envision the future of Battlefield classes to be a series of interconnected systems and fundamentals that shape your role on the field, while granting you the freedom to customize how you execute that role," DICE said. "Through Battlefield Labs play sessions, feedback, and data gathering, we aim to strike a balance between defined roles and player choice."</p><p>While this is DICE's plan for now, the studio said it might make changes throughout the Battlefield Labs testing process. DICE encouraged people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to try the game out in a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>. As for when it may launch, it's due for release by the end of March 2026, but now that GTA 6 has been delayed, some are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">theorizing it may come out this fall.</a></p>

There are also brief teasers of weapon charms and emotes featuring various Street Fighter characters.</p><p>The Akuma full armor set will turn your character into the combat demon. In a trailer revealing the collaboration, Street Fighter-style graphics and narration can be heard, and although we're not certain that this will appear if you fell a monster as Akuma, it would be a great touch for fans of the franchise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207"></a><figcaption>We're hoping the trailer's Street Fighter-style narration comes with the collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png"></figure><p>Akuma can also be seen competing in the game's arm-wrestling tournaments and traversing the environment while yelling in his recognizable aggressive tone.</p><p>Alongside the Street Fighter collaboration on May 28, Monster Hunter Wilds will also see an additional tempered monster with other gameplay adjustments as part of update 1.011.

                <p>Elgato is introducing Stream Deck modules, the MK.2 Stream Deck, and new Virtual Stream Deck software. The Elgato Stream Deck, as the name suggests, was initially aimed at streamers as a way to quickly do things like manipulate on-screen stream elements without having to interrupt your stream by going to a separate app. Instead, a number of programmable buttons on the interface can be bound to certain apps, keybinds, and commands to achieve quick results, such as changing stream scenes or sending your audience to another creator's stream in a raid. It turns out, though, that there are lots of uses for such an idea.</p><p>Elgato's developer-friendly platform has long supported letting anyone do just about anything with a Stream Deck, but now it is looking to blow out that experience in a big way with its newest showings at Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module" data-collection="" title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato Stream Deck Module</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Stream Deck Module is a case of a company listening to its users and responding. Hobbyists have been ripping apart Stream Decks to use the buttons and front panel as parts of bigger projects, and the Module is for exactly those users. Available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and housed in an aluminum casing, these unbranded panels are intended to be integrated into those projects. The Module will be available for $49.99 for the six-key variant, $129.99 for the 15-key model, and $199.99 for 32-keys. </p>                      </div><p>Alongside the Modules, a $79.99 Stream Deck network dock will allow you to plug a Stream Deck in anywhere you have a network port, further opening the possibilities for use in things like smart home setups and other projects.</p><p>The MK.2 Stream Deck, available for $149.99, pushes things forward in a different way. If you've ever owned a Stream Deck--I use my six-key Stream Deck to control Spotify and switch audio devices--you know the keys can be kind of mushy. Since they're not meant to be used for typing, that's not so bad, but it can be hard to tell if you've actuated one of those keys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUcQNxSOGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvUcQNxSOGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The MK.2 swaps out the membrane beneath the current Stream Deck keys with scissor switches, which can be commonly found on laptop and other similarly low-profile keyboards. Elgato says this will provide "enhanced speed and precision," and "lends itself to typing-style interactions" that could pave the way for new Stream Deck use cases. Remember the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/popularis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Optimus Keyboard</a>, that striking keyboard that featured a screen on every key? It's not hard to imagine scissor switches allowing Elgato to move in the direction of making a full keyboard.</p><p>Finally, Elgato is bringing a software-only Stream Deck app to market for desktop systems. It's similar to the existing Stream Deck mobile app, which allows you to turn your phone or tablet into a soft Stream Deck. The software will be available at first to anyone with a physical Stream Deck, and will be bundled with the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse and Corsair Xenon Edge touchscreen--the Stream Deck 7.0 beta requires that you connect one of those devices for the VSD feature to be available. Notably, though, unlike its mobile equivalent, things like custom layouts and virtual faceplates won't be locked behind a paid subscription. Elgato says that the VSD software will be available with a greater range of hardware over time. We're also quite sure that no one is going to figure out a way to simulate owning a Stream Deck to make the software usable by anyone. No way at all.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Lies of P Overture Director explains how the DLC will create a complete experience</p>
      </div>
<p>Once the update goes live alongside the Overture expansion, you will get to choose from two new gameplay difficulty options, Butterfly's Guidance and Awakened Puppet. The default difficulty level will be renamed to "Legendary Stalker" in the upcoming patch. For those of you looking for a greater challenge, will be able to take part in a boss rush mode that has several tiers of escalating difficulty. Additionally, the new Death March mode is a gauntlet of boss fights where your health and inventory will be more limited.</p><p>Difficulty options in souls-like games have been a polarizing topic for years now. Dark Souls and Elden Ring developer From Software typically refrains from adding such options to its games, while other studios allow a wider selection of options to make the experience more forgiving. Stellar Blade is a good example here, as the Sekiro-influenced game offers several difficulty modes and gameplay assists. On the extreme side, Steel Rising by developer Spiders has options that turns the game into a cakewalk.</p><p>Lies of P: Overture is expected to launch in summer for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Neowiz says you can expect it to take <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-expansion-will-take-up-to-20-hours-isnt-related-to-that-cutscene/1100-6530393/">between 15-20 hours to complete</a>.</p>
