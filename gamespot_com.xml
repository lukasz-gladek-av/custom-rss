                <p>Combining cute Japanese vending machine aesthetics with classic management sim mechanics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/vending-machine-co/" data-ref-id="5000-681731">Vending Machine Co.</a> is on its way to help you build a passive income empire. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-simulation-games/2900-6819/" data-ref-id="2900-6819">simulation game</a> will release in full later this year, but is currently previewing its kawaii aesthetic with a free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622640/Vending_Machine_Co/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam demo</a>.</p><p>Japan is well-known for its vending machine culture, and this new management sim is putting you in charge of your own Japanese vending machine empire. You can choose which neighborhood to put your machines in, and what to stock them with, with different demographics of customers likely to purchase different stock.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBY62FhhbJc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RBY62FhhbJc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Vending Machine Co. follows the classic management sim formula, its cute illustrative style and satisfying restocking gameplay is reminiscent of cozy indie hit Unpacking. Managing your machines will initiate other little mini-games along the way, from repairs and upkeep to sorting and counting your cash.</p><p>Vending Machine Co. is due for a release at an unspecified date later this year, but has a free demo available now. The demo just got a handful of upgrades, including two new neighborhoods to explore and set up your vending machines in, as well as some standard bug fixes and balance updates.</p><p>When the full release drops later this year, it will include a bunch more neighborhoods, including a salaryman-centric business district, a temple area frequented by tourists, and a youth-focused university ward. The full game will also include more items, minigames, and collectables, and will encourage players to explore its curious neighborhoods outside of building their vending machine business.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Xbox is headed to Japan later this month, as it'll be hosting a livestream during Tokyo Game Show. Scheduled for September 25 at 3 AM PT / 6 AM ET, the broadcast will be focused on various first-party, as well as "news from our partners in Japan, across Asia, and around the world," Xbox added.</p><p>"We know players around the world delight in Japan-inspired content and games developed in Asia, and we can't wait to connect with players across the globe to show off the incredible talent and creativity behind upcoming games coming to Xbox," Xbox Asia senior director Mena Kato said (<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/08/xbox-tgs-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Xbox Wire</a>). If you can't make it to Japan, the Xbox broadcast will be livestreamed through official Xbox and TGS channels:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/XboxASL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch (With American Sign Language support)</a></li></ul><p>Xbox confirmed that attendees will be able to go hands-on with its upcoming mobile gaming PCs it co-developed with Asus, the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. Ninja Gaiden 4 will also be playable at the Koei Tecmo booth, but there is speculation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-reportedly-set-to-be-revealed-at-tokyo-game-show-next-month/1100-6534227/">Microsoft could announce Forza Horizon 6 at the trade show</a>. With the game rumored to be set in Japan, officially revealing it at Tokyo Game Show would be thematically appropriate.</p><p>Beyond a possible Forza Horizon 6 announcement, Microsoft still has plenty of games on the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-is-the-ninja-gaiden-game-youre-hoping-it-will-be/1100-6533763/" data-ref-id="1100-6533763">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/outer-worlds-2-lets-you-play-a-bumbling-space-moron-in-way-over-their-head/1100-6534316/" data-ref-id="1100-6534316">The Outer Worlds 2</a> all launch in October launches next month, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> drops into action on November 14.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
