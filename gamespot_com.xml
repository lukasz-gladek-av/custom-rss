Localthunk and PlayStack have announced Friends Of Jimbo 3, a free update to the card-based roguelike which brings eight more friendly faces to face cards for your next run.</p><p dir="ltr">The pack was announced in a new trailer starring Ben Starr--the voice off Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI, Prometheus in Hades II, and more--as the Balatro jester Jimbo. The trailer also introduces all eight guests included in Friends of Jimbo 3, which range from indie hits to robust RPGs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r1LVgAGXlE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1r1LVgAGXlE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The list of games included in the Balatro Friends Of Jimbo 3 pack is below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Divinity: Original Sin 2</li><li dir="ltr">Donâ€™t Starve</li><li dir="ltr">Enter the Gungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Cult of the Lamb</li><li dir="ltr">1000x Resist</li><li dir="ltr">Potion Craft</li><li dir="ltr">Shovel Knight</li><li dir="ltr">Warframe</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Balatro is a roguelike deckbuilder where players use traditional playing cards to score as many points as possible against "blinds."

It has seen over 3.5 million downloads since its initial release, and its success has garnered five nominations at The Game Awards, including Game Of The Year, Best Game Direction, and Best Independent Game.
