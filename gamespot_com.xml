Designed to be comfortable and featuring a lightweight construction, it's powered by a Snapdragon processor and runs SteamOS. It also supports standalone play and full controller-input support for PC VR and non-VR games.</p><p dir="ltr">The headset has a 2160 x 2160 LCD per eye, a 110-degree FOV, 72 - 144Hz refreesh rate, 16GB of RAM, and will be available in 256GB and 1TB models. Storage capacity can also be expanded with microSD cards, and the Steam Frame controllers have 6-DOF tracking, capacitive finger-sensing, magnetic thumbsticks, and a battery life of up to 40 hours when using AA batteries.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've been super happy with the success of Steam Deck, and a lot of the feedback we've received from gamers about it is what encouraged us to expand the options for Steam users. Along with Steam Deck, these are devices designed to work together, optimized for Steam while continuing to operate as open platforms," Valve added in a press release.</p><p>The Steam Deck has been well-received since it first launched several years ago--and helped kick off a new line of mobile gaming PCs from other companies--and Valve is rumored to be working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-2-release-is-over-two-years-away-according-to-new-rumor/1100-6534362/">new and upgraded model that might launch in 2027</a>. This space has heated up recently with the arrival of Lenovo and MSI handhelds, and recently, Asus and Microsoft launched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-is-good-hardware-let-down-by-annoying-software/1100-6535471/">ROG Xbox Ally X</a> with AMD's new Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip. On the console side, Sony also offers the PlayStation Portal, a handheld that streams games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps-portal-update-adds-full-cloud-streaming-two-years-after-launch/1100-6535944/">from either a PS5 console or the cloud</a>.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Redsec launched recently, and among the complaints about the battle royale game was that it has no olos playlist. One may be coming, however.</p><p>Design director Justin Wiebe told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/keep-your-ear-to-the-ground-battlefield-6-devs-hear-the-cries-for-battle-royale-solo-queue-in-redsec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I would say keep your ear to the ground on the future of solos." For now, however, Wiebe wanted to talk more about the reasons why Redsec has no solos playlist.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn8k1g3vMDU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rn8k1g3vMDU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for why Redsec doesn't have a solos playlist, Wiebe said the game was built as a "squad-based experience" and it's not as simple as you might think to add solos. "In my mind, that's not something you just turn on and just say, 'OK, solos,'" he said.</p><p>Wiebe added: "There needs to be enough thought put into it because we built a squad-based experience. At its foundation, the game was designed for squads to play together, with each of them having tactical abilities and options, and training paths that unlock new perks. A lot of those perks are very oriented towards helping the squad, not helping the individual."</p><p>"I we were just to throw that out and say, 'Well, now you can just play solos, and you're unlocking these abilities that don't even matter to you,' that feels like a fail."</p><p>If Redsec were to get a solos playlist, Wiebe said it would need to be done "in a way that makes sense for players, that actually takes the mechanics and makes them work for making solos play better."</p><p>For now, Redsec offers Duos or Squads playlists where people can play in groups of two or four. Redsec's Gauntlet mode, meanwhile, supports teams of four.</p><p>As for Battlefield 6, the multiplayer game continues to expand in Season 1 with the release of the California Resistance update on November 18. Among other things, it adds the new map Eastwood.</p>

This quest requires you to round up a key on Blue Gate and use it to open one of the armored patrol cars scattered around the middle portion of the map. In this guide, we'll tell you where to find the key and how to spot one of these vehicles.</p><p>You need to extract from Blue Gate once you've completed this quest, so bring in a good loadout--including a solid shield and weapon you're comfortable with--to reduce any concerns that you might lose some good stuff if you find yourself in a battle.</p><p>Once you're ready to head out, here's how to complete the Armored Transport quest.</p><h2>Where to find the Armored Patrol Car Key</h2><p>The first step to completing Armored Transports is to find the Patrol Car Key. This item is found in the Checkpoint POI in the center of the map. This is a dangerous location often filled with powerful ARCs like Bastions and Rocketeers--not to mention other raiders.

The bad news is that the spawns are rather randomized. The good news is that they're still relatively easy to find within the Checkpoint POI.</p><p>To find an armored patrol car, you'll just need to head directly north of where you found the Patrol Car Key and <strong>enter the large tunnel filled with vehicles</strong>. The path to the armored patrol car is often lined with wasps, hornets, and probably a rocketeer and a bastion either just outside the tunnel or inside of it, so staying well hidden and using smoke grenades or the cloaking device, if you're lucky enough to have one, will be extremely helpful here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601170" data-ratio="0.56168468132687" data-width="2683" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601170"></a><figcaption>Enter this large tunnel to seek an armored patrol car.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601170-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>There are tons of patrol cars throughout this interior area, but most will have already been hollowed out. You'll need to seek one that's intact, which is <strong>easily identified by the closed back door with a light shining on it.</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600404-share_20251110_0847312.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600404" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600404-share_20251110_0847312.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600404"></a><figcaption>Unopened armored patrol cars have a light shining on their back door.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600404-share_20251110_0847312.jpeg"></figure><p>When you find an armored patrol car, approach the back door and use the Patrol Car Key to open it. Inside is a gun case containing a random gun, which you'll need to loot. Doing so will complete the quest.</p><p>With the quest objectives complete, you'll want to finish looting anything of interest in the Checkpoint POI, then head southeast to the Overlook Airshaft or northwest to the Cliffside Airshaft to get back to Speranza and turn in the quest. If you got a particularly good gun from the gun case, be sure to store it away for a special run later.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601168-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601168" data-ratio="0.56168468132687" data-width="2683" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601168-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4601168"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4601168-share_20251112_0535150-copy-copy.jpeg"></figure>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<h3 id="New_map_and_community_unlock_event">New map and community unlock event</h3><p>The game's first four maps have been joined by a fifth called Stella Montis. Referred to as "cold, pristine, and filled with the remnants of humanity's lost ambitions," Stella Montis will presumably be an unforgiving map filled with snow or icy conditions.</p><p>This new map requires the community to work together to open, however, meaning it won't be available immediately. This multi-phase community event--called Breaking New Ground--will begin at <strong>1:30 AM PT / 4:30 AM ET</strong> and ask players to figure out how to open the path to Stella Montis via the tunnels in Speranza.</p><p>As everyone works toward contributing resources to the tunnel efforts, they'll earn a new currency called Merits that will help push things to a second phase of the event called "Staking Our Claim," which will unleash players into Stella Montis with an all-new progression track, challenges, and rewards. This portion of the event will last until December.</p><h3 id="New_enemies">New enemies</h3><p>The North Line update also includes two new ARC foes for players to take down: Matriarch and Shredder.</p><p>The Matriarch is described as "a hulking ARC that makes the Queen look friendly by comparison," so you'll want to start getting your Wolfpacks and Hullcrackers ready. This giant enemy will only spawn during certain map conditions, similarly to the Queen's Harvester event.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Shredder is exclusively available to fight on Stella Montis, and it's expected to force players into close-quarters encounters. In a game where even a hit or two can spell disaster, the Shredder sounds terrifying by name alone.</p><h3 id="New_rifle__grenades__and_mines">New rifle, grenades, and mines</h3><p>Another weapon called the Aphelion joins the fray, too, adding another energy-based firearm for players to use when tackling the ARC. In addition to this fresh weapon are two new grenades--Seeker Grenade and Trailblazer Grenade--and three new mines--Pulse Mine, Deadline Mine, and Gas Mine.</p><h3 id="New_quests">New quests</h3><p>Lastly, players can continue helping Speranza with a new questline focused on Stella Montis and the resources (and dangers) that await there. We'll be updating our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a> with these as we dive in and begin taking on the ARC in Stella Montis.</p><h3 id="More_on_the_way_in_December">More on the way in December</h3><p>The North Line update is just the beginning of a long road ahead for raiders enjoying their time in Arc Raiders. Embark Studios has already teased what to expect in its next major update, saying, "The North Line is just the beginning of Arc Raiders’ post-launch roadmap. The next update, Cold Snap, arrives this December--introducing the Flickering Flames event, new snowfall Map Condition, the awaited Expedition Project Raider reset, and more."</p>
