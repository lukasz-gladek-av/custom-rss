                <p dir="ltr">The conventional wisdom is that Kinect was an albatross on Xbox One, making the system more expensive at launch and taking away resource power. But now, over a decade later, the Kinect-like Nex Playground has outsold Xbox hardware for November in the US, according to Circana.</p><p dir="ltr">Nex Playground came in third for hardware units sold last month, outpacing Xbox Series X|S. The only saving grace is that Xbox raked in more dollar sales, as Nex Playground retails for $250 but has been on sale for $200 over the holiday season. Overall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hardware-sales-in-the-us-just-had-worst-month-in-30-years/1100-6537041/">video game hardware sales were pretty bleak</a>, reaching a low not seen since November 1995.</p><p dir="ltr">This might not be a total shock for those paying attention. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-wont-guess-what-just-outsold-every-ps5-and-xbox-console-model-in-the-us/1100-6536701/">Nex Playground actually outsold every PS5 and Xbox console bundle</a> for a week last month in the US. The cube-shaped console features a camera to track body movements, similar to Kinect. Five games are pre-installed, with the option to purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, Circana senior director Mat Piscatella noted that the Nex Playground has been a "remarkable story" recently. "There could be a lesson here that more affordable, family-friendly gaming devices carry appeal during holiday gifting season," Piscatella added.</p><p dir="ltr">On the software side, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-sales-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6537040/">the best-selling game last month in the US</a>. However, the FPS faced a double-digit percentage decrease compared to 2024's Black Ops 6, and Battlefield 6 is the top-selling game for 2025 to date.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> is one of the games currently in the works at Bethesda Game Studios. It's still years away from release, but now Bethesda boss Todd Howard has shared a small update about it.</p><p>He told the <a href="https://bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC</a> that Fallout 5 will be influenced in part by the popular Prime Video Fallout TV show. "In short, yes," he said. "Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><p>Fallout 76 has also been influenced by the TV series, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-expansion-is-adding-the-ghoul-from-prime-videos-fallout-series/1100-6535155/" data-ref-id="1100-6535155">gets new content based on the show, including Walton Goggins' character, The Ghoul. </a>That game is free to play now through December 22, presumably to cash in on the debut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Fallout Season 2.</a></p><p>Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/" data-ref-id="1100-6504615">first revealed Fallout 5 back in 2022</a>, saying it would be released after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. There is no word yet on when that game will be released, so fans should get very comfortable for Fallout 5. It's not coming out anytime soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, Bethesda said Fallout was the franchise that the developer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-is-the-franchise-that-bethesda-is-doing-the-most-in-right-now/1100-6536889/" data-ref-id="1100-6536889">"doing the most in."</a></p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this: It's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>In the BBC interview, Howard also discussed how he's happy that the Fallout TV show on Prime Video can help introduce more people to the world of Fallout.</p><p>"There's still so many people that won't play a game--I think that's getting better but there's still people who are intimidated," he said. "They still get to experience Fallout and I think that's really important because they're now equal fans of the world."</p><p>Beyond Fallout 5, it's rumored that Bethesda is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-remaster-is-real-another-report-says/1100-6536093/" data-ref-id="1100-6536093">remaster of Fallout 3.</a></p><p>For more on the wider Fallout world, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-kicked-off-with-a-bang-literally/1100-6537031/" data-ref-id="1100-6537031">GameSpot's breakdown of Fallout Season 2, Episode 1</a> and our rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-easter-eggs-include-a-damn-fine-twin-peaks-reference/1100-6537032/" data-ref-id="1100-6537032">all the Easter eggs in Episode 1.</a></p>
