                <p>Leaderboards have previously been a part of the Diablo franchise, and starting today, they're back. Blizzard is releasing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> update across all platforms that reintroduces leaderboards as well as the multi-level dungeons known as The Tower.</p><p>Blizzard's <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24247514/dominate-the-tower-and-leaderboards-beta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a> states that The Tower and the leaderboards are both in beta, with more refinements to come in future seasons. The leaderboards will be divided by the seven playable classes--Paladin, Rogue, Druid, Barbarian, Sorcerer, Necromancer, and Spiritborn. Additionally, the leaderboard rankings will only be set for two weeks periods rather than the entire season. Essentially, everyone gets a chance for a fresh start while Blizzard works out any kinks in the system.</p><p>The leaderboard's rankings are directly linked to The Tower as players' scores are tabulated based on their performance when fighting monsters and bosses. Experienced players with refined character builds should be right at home in the chaos. For less experienced players, The Tower provides enhanced damage levels when players destroy the numerous pylons in the complex. That may not be the equal of having incredibly powerful characters, but it means that players of all skill levels are far from helpless against the onslaught of creatures coming for them in The Tower.</p><p>Diablo 4's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred</a>, is set to arrive on April 28. On April 21, readers can catch the prequel novel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lost-Horadrim-Diablo-IV/dp/0425284891?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim</a>, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">available for preorder now</a>.</p><p>In the meantime, Diablo 4's 2.5.2 build is set to go live on January 12 across Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5 and PC.

                <p>In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> could be getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-be-in-the-works-for-switch-2-report/1100-6535644/" data-ref-id="1100-6535644">a port for Nintendo's Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&amp;D will not be coming to Nintendo's console.</p><p>During a recent AMA session on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied.</p><p>"We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make," wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related.</p><p>In another post from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylg3dd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> session, Vincke indicated that the "smaller" game that the company had in mind post-Baldur's Gate 3 was "another DnD game, but that ship has sailed."</p><p>Last month, Larian released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">an upgraded version of Divinity: Original Sin II</a> on Switch 2 and other modern consoles. As revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Larian has turned its attention to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game. Vinke recently noted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/" data-ref-id="1100-6537029">team feels pressure</a> from the success of Baldur's Gate 3 to exceed it with their next project.</p><p>"It's more pressure," said Vincke. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Divinity doesn't currently have a release date.</p>
