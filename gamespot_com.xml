                <p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">EA's new college basketball game</a>, 2K Sports is seemingly entering the fray as well in some form or another. Following EA's announcement, the NBA 2K account <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a cryptic message</a> that suggested college basketball might be in the works for the NBA 2K series.</p><p>"The campus has been quiet for too long," the post said.</p><p>A spokesperson for 2K, meanwhile, told GameSpot, "2K is the undisputed home of basketball gaming. We have a strong history with college hoops and are exploring exciting new ways to bring athletes and schools to life. Class is in session."</p><p>2K Sports previously published the College Hoops 2K series, featuring real schools from NCAA universities. 2K shut down the series after College Hoops 2K8, which was released in 2007. EA's own NCAA Basketball series was discontinued after 2009's NCAA Basketball 2010.</p><p>On June 30, EA announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">making a new college basketball game</a>. It also came to light that the Collegiate Licensing Corporation sought bidders to make a new college basketball game, with multiple parties submitting bids, though none were named outright. The CLC's proposal called for women's basketball teams to be included alongside men's teams.</p><p>From the wording of the NBA 2K social media post, and the fact that it came from the NBA 2K account, it sounds like this won't be a new College Hoops game but instead a college mode within NBA 2K--which is something fans have been asking for. However, that's not confirmed at this stage.</p><p>There is a lot of money in college sports video games, as EA's recent College Football 25 made more than <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1 billion in revenue</a> and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US. </a> Any new college basketball games or modes likely won't be made in partnership with the NCAA, which broke off with video game publishers years ago due to a variety of legal and financial reasons.</p><p>EA's new college basketball game isn't expected to arrive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/" data-ref-id="1100-6532831">until 2028</a>, while the next NBA 2K title is due out this year. Whether or not any college basketball mode is added to the game this year is unknown, however.</p>
