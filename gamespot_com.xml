                <p>Bandai Namco has announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares III</a> will launch on October 10, and a Switch 2 version is in the works. In addition, the publisher is giving away the remastered original game as a bonus for preordering. </p><p><span>Alongside the release date, the publisher also released a new trailer, which you can see in the embed below. The trailer shows what you can expect from the adventure game, including the characteristic tilt-shift style, dark and atmospheric environments, and cartoonishly spooky enemies.</span></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=narIoF9doAM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/narIoF9doAM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Preordering the game comes with an in-game costume set as well as Little Nightmares Enhanced Edition, a remaster of the original game. The Enhanced Edition has improved graphics and performance, allowing the game to run at 4K/60fps and boasting features like ray-tracing and volumetric lighting. The remaster is unlocked as soon as you place your preorder. If you already own the original game, you'll get a free upgrade to the Enhanced Edition on October 10. </p><p>Little Nightmares III is slated for release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, the original Nintendo Switch, and now also Switch 2. On PlayStation and Xbox, the standard edition costs $40, while the Deluxe Edition will run you $60 and comes with some additional in-game content (right now, the Steam preorder is $60 for standard and $80 for Deluxe, and it is unclear if this discrepancy is intentional or not). While it'll likely be familiar to fans of the series, Little Nightmares III makes a big change with the addition of co-op--a bold choice, and one that we thought showed promise when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-little-nightmares-3-the-addition-of-co-op-might-actually-make-the-game-scarier/1100-6526294/" data-ref-id="1100-6526294">we previewed the game last year</a>.</p>

                <p>Fan-made video games based on popular franchises always run the risk of having the official rights-holder step in and shut things down, but that's not happening with Spartan Survivors.</p><p>The community-developed game, which has players fighting hordes of Covenant and Flood enemies as Master Chief or the Arbiter, has been given an official blessing from Microsoft. The developers <a href="https://x.com/SpartnSurvivors/status/1937572095573283004" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Microsoft reached out to them to say they "really love to see the passion" from the team. People at Microsoft apparently played the game as well. "It really is fun and we look forward to getting further in our playthrough and unlocking more stuff," the Halo representative said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuvhdWvzVw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fJuvhdWvzVw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft, did, however, have one specific request for the developers. Microsoft reportedly asked the team to add language to the legal disclaimer in the game's credits and on store pages to make it ultra-clear that the project is not an official Halo game or made in partnership with Halo Studios.</p><p>This language will be added in the next update to Spartan Survivors. "We want to thank Halo Studios and Microsoft for their real sympathy toward us," the studio said.</p><p>You can <a href="https://juanggz.itch.io/spartan-survivors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">download Spartan Survivors today on itch.io</a> for free. The game's store page mentions that it's also coming to Xbox and Steam in 2025, but as of yet, it's unclear when that might happen. The announcement trailer can be seen above, containing the outdated language mentioning a 2024 release.</p><p>Microsoft is moving ahead with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">its own new Halo games</a>, which are in the works at the newly rebranded Halo Studios and will run on Unreal Engine 5.

Title Update 1.0.6 is headlined by a quest developed in collaboration with Critical Role, as well as a new, more challenging difficulty setting.</p><p>The update's new questline is called A Critical Encounter, and its narrative centers around Rufino, a character first created during Critical Role's one-off Assassin's Creed-themed series. Rufino is voice-acted by Critical Role's Robbie Daymond, and completion of the quest unlocks Rufino as an Ally. In addition to this quest, Ubisoft is also adding a Critical Role-themed weapon pack that can be purchased in the in-game store.</p>

<p>The update also adds a new Nightmare difficulty setting, designed to significantly increase the challenge that players face. Nightmare increases enemy skill and decreases the effectiveness of player abilities; enemies are not only stronger, but also faster and smarter, according to the patch notes. Players will also have to be more careful about noise; on this setting, Naoe will make a sound even while crouching.</p><p>Along with these two big content additions, the update adds a bunch of changes and tweaks to improve the game. For instance, players can now opt to remove headgear during cutscenes; Ubisoft has also added a toggle for specific VFX. Title Update 1.0.6 launches tomorrow, June 25, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET / 2 PM UTC; You can check out the whole list of changes in the patch notes below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520225"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to unlock Critical Role's Rufino as an Ally (image via Ubisoft). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4520225-7017860412-TU6_R.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first big collaboration that Ubisoft has done for Shadows.

You will also get a banner in the hideout with the Critical Role logo.</li><li>New Trophy/Achievement: "A Critical Encounter", received upon completion of the questline.</li></ul><p>With this collaboration, we will also release a Critical Role Weapon Pack inspired by the Critical Role universe, available for purchase in the game store! This pack includes 2 weapons for both characters, a Tanto and Katana for Naoe and a Kanabo and Teppo for Yasuke.</p><h4>New Nightmare Difficulty Setting</h4><p>We are adding a new Difficulty Setting (Nightmare) that will introduce additional challenges to your journey. This mode will impact both combat and stealth, requiring more tactical planning and greater attention to your surroundings. Prepare for tougher enemies and a more intense overall experience.</p><p>Here is a tease of some changes you can expect from this new difficulty:</p><ul><li>Player defensive options are less effective, and enemies deal greater damage at all levels.  <ul><li>E.g., Parries now require perfect timing to deflect the hit--imperfect parries will only partially block incoming damage.</li></ul></li><li>Enemy AI is smarter, faster, and more aggressive in a variety of circumstances, including detection.  <ul><li>E.g., Even while crouching, Naoe now generates some sound! And even while in the shadows, she can be seen while moving!</li><li>E.g., Enemies will no longer become vulnerable from dodges or parries--only abilities can put them into a vulnerable state.</li></ul></li><li>Combat resources (like adrenaline, rations, and shinobi items) are harder to come by, making their use even more vital.</li></ul><h4>Toggle Headgear in Cutscenes</h4><p>We're excited to introduce a highly requested feature: players can now choose to show headgear, whether it's a hood, helmet, headband, or more during cutscenes. Now your style can shine through dialogue scenes too!</p><p>You will find the option available in the in-game settings.</p><ul><li>Note that headgear will not be displayed in cinematics or in some specific instances where a rule overrides this setting (romance-specific cutscenes).</li></ul><h4>VFX Toggles</h4><p>Players can now disable/enable specific VFX to further customize their experience. These include the ability to hide or show the loot on dead bodies, the last known position of the player, the special attacks indicators of the enemies, and more.</p><p>All will be accessible in the Interface option menu.</p><h4>Open World Alarm</h4><p>We have expanded the Regional Alert System available in Castles to the whole Province. Now by repetitively attacking Civilians or Military units outside Castles, the alarm can be triggered, and a group of Guardians will hunt you in the world.</p><h4>Horse Camera Presets</h4><p>You can now toggle between 3 different camera presets while riding on your mount (hold the down button on controller/'X' key on keyboard while riding) allowing for a more cinematic experience to take in the full beauty of Japan.</p><h4>Ultra Low Specs for PC</h4><p>We are adding a new visual quality level, the Ultra Low mode. This will allow PC players with a limited GPU configuration to experience the game in better framerate conditions.</p><h3>List of Bug Fixes</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Onryo Mask remained visible despite selecting the option to hide gear.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to earn Mastery Points.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Mastery Points were not returned after resetting the Mastery Tree.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not switch characters anymore even without gameplay context restrictions.</li><li>Fixed an issue where allies could be trained to veteran rank without upgrading the dojo to level 3.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Gennojo did not immediately appear in the hideout after recruitment. <em>He was busy washing his hair!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player remains stuck in a Red Zone, without being able to fast travel anywhere, by allowing them to fast travel to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Oni Drawing remains stuck on screen after completing the "Vision of the Realms" quest.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h4>Quests</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "A Chance Encounter" quest when following Fuyu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the quest after defeating all Kabukimono.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Lady Oichi's letter became unavailable after the Fuji-maru cutscene.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to talk to Katsuhime in the crop field when she was sitting on the ground. <em>She just wanted some peace and quiet!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where tracking the "Temple Stories" quest only showed a progress bar with no text.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Genzaburo's Teppo Master was missing from the Kaya Shrine.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yagyu Munetoshi revealed a later plot point too early in the "Nobutsuna's Students" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not assassinate the Godai of Void because the NPC was missing. <em>He took his name too seriously.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest after dodge rolling and dropping Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest when there was no immediate option to carry Katsuhime.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players glitched through an anomaly in the "Heads Will Roll" quest, making Animus activities unavailable.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in the "Lost Honor" quest because the game failed to switch to Naoe.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress through the Tournament after dying.</li></ul><h4>Visuals &amp; Graphics</h4><ul><li>Fixed some minor visual issues.</li><li>Fixed misplaced visual elements with the Dark Woods Kusarigama.</li><li>Fixed an issue where all NPC horses appeared as identical.</li><li>Fixed a clipping issue with Naoe's Sekiryu outfit.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the "Bloodshade Katana" being visible out of the sheath when transmogged.</li><li>Fixed a movement physics issue with the Dead by Daylight Oni's armor.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue where footstep audio occasionally ceased when opening the map while moving.</li></ul>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 makes some big improvements over the first console, especially when comparing it to the first iteration that came out in 2017. A lot of that has to do with the significantly more powerful APU, but the larger, crisper screen is certainly the upgrade you'll notice first. It could also be the area where you might notice where the Switch 2 falls short of its predecessor.</p><p>Shortly after release, some discussions regarding how blurry the on-board display seemed to be started surfacing, prompting some hardware publications to take a closer look. Hardware Unboxed, known for detailed reviews of PC hardware and monitors, conducted a few tests on the Nintendo Switch 2 display, taking a closer look at the screen's response time. Running the display through 20 gray-to-gray transitions to measure response times, Hardware Unboxed determined that the Switch 2's LCD was one of the slowest it's ever tested, coming in at 33.3ms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB67B8LCorI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AB67B8LCorI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To put that into context, Hardware Unboxed compared this to an average LCD panel you'll find in entry-level displays today. These were tested in the same manner and averaged out to a response time of 6.3ms. Perhaps the most damning was the comparison to the original Switch's LCD, a display that is more than eight years old, that presented a response time nearly twice as fast a 21.3ms. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noted the same issues with the display in its extensive Nintendo Switch 2 review earlier this week, noting that, "The Switch 2 LCD has blurring characteristics that are easily worse than the 2017 Switch's display"</p><p>Why does a fast response time matter? With slower response times, it takes longer for the image on-screen to transition between new frames, which can lead to noticeable blurring with objects in motion. This is particularly bad when the Switch 2 is running games at 60fps, which thus far is the preferred frame rate of most first-party titles. To put it into perspective, it takes 16.67ms for a new frame to be rendered when running at 60Hz, but it takes the display twice as long to transition from one frame to the next, causing a significant bottleneck that reduces the impact of improved motion clarity that higher refresh rates provide. This would be just as bad, if not worse, in games making use of the full 120Hz the new display has to offer.</p><p>It's unclear why this is happening, but Hardware Unboxed offers a suggestion that Nintendo has decided to reduce an overdrive support for the display (which uses higher voltages to drive faster transitions) in the pursuit of better battery life. With a display that is brighter and larger, Nintendo might have potentially reduced its ability to transition faster as a tradeoff. Given that the Nintendo Switch 2 ships with a 19Wh battery, less than half of that found in Valve's Steam Deck, it's understandable why this concession might have been made. But considering how noticeable it can be once you've seen it, it could make portable play significantly less desirable until addressed, if it ever is.</p>

                <p>One of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>'s main endgame activities, Nightmare dungeons, will be permanently changed come Season 9, as Blizzard looks to make them both more challenging and surprising going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed in a new <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215863/purge-the-sins-of-the-horadrim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, when Season 9 launches July 1, Nightmare dungeons will receive some major updates. Most notably, there will be a new activity within them called Horadric Strongrooms. Described as a "potent micro-dungeon," strongrooms will be found more frequently on higher Torment difficulties and can also be reliably found by using a Nightmare dungeon sigil that guarantees the appearance of a strongroom.</p><p dir="ltr">Once players are inside the dungeon, players can discover a portal that will take them to the strongroom. In a system somewhat similar to Diablo 4's Infernal Hordes activity, players will be able to select from a number of statues that add modifiers to the strongroom, increasing the challenge but also the rewards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W5UkhQVtMQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6W5UkhQVtMQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will then need to attune themselves with the strongroom by slaying enemies within the vicinity of Horadric Pillars within a time limit. Those who complete the attunement process will be transported to the micro-dungeon's final boss that when defeated will reward a Grand Horadric cache that scales its rewards based on the amount of attunement players earned. These caches will include Obducite as a reward, an endgame material needed to Masterwork weapons and armor. Completing the strongroom will also grant a buff that lasts for the remainder of the Nightmare dungeon, which a chance to receive more XP from monsters, increased reputation gains, increased Obducite drops, 25% more gold, or Horadric Phial drops (a seasonal item that is used to make Horadric Jewels).</p><p dir="ltr">There will, however, be another new way to experience Nightmare dungeons--Escalating Nightmares. This new endgame activity is a sequence of three Nightmare dungeons that see dungeon affixes stack from one to the next, with monster difficulty additionally increasing for each subsequent dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">To access an Escalating Nightmare, players will need to find Escalation Sigils from completing Horadric Strongrooms. In pre-Torment difficulties, completing all three dungeons will finish the Escalating Nightmare. However, those playing on Torment difficulties will instead be transported to a boss fight, where players will take on a new version of Astaroth from the Diablo 4 main campaign. Players will need to defeat both Astaroth and his steed, which will become separate bosses over the course of the fight. Defeating Astaroth's mount first will see it go into a resurrection state, after which it will rejoin the fight if players can't defeat Astaroth in time. Astaroth can also be modified by Nightmare dungeon affixes, making the boss fight even more challenging.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520164"></a><figcaption>A look at everything coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4520164-diablo4season9infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Nightmare dungeons will receive new affixes. Each Nightmare sigil will sport both a positive and negative affix. New positive affixes include the guaranteed appearance of specific shrines, increased XP gains, the appearance of Treasure Goblins, a guaranteed strongroom, equipment rewards, and currency drops.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Nightmare dungeon changes will be permanent additions to Diablo 4, Season 9 will additionally introduce new seasonal mechanics for a limited-time. Players will be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-will-let-players-build-their-own-spells/1100-6531782/" data-ref-id="1100-6531782">create and modify Horadric Spells</a> to compliment their builds, and can further augment them using new Horadric Jewels that can be slotted into amulets and rings.

This update is focused on "squeezing out even more" from Dying Light, the studio said. "It's not a complete overhaul or remaster," the developer clarified, adding that the team has found new ways to "squeeze more from the tech we already have."</p><p>"One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets--and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game," technical game director Grzegorz Świstowski said.</p><p>In the Retouched update, players can expect increased texture quality and upscaling for textures to help them look "sharper" and better overall.</p><p>Additionally, the "maximum level of detail range" in Dying Light has been increased from 260% to 340% in the view distance menu from the game's settings. The studio is also adding new "8K Ultra shadow quality" and improved lighting for many surfaces. Surfaces that might have previously looked "flat" should not "really pop out and get depth."</p><p>Check out some of the images in the gallery below to see the improvements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148" data-ratio="0.55555555555556" data-width="738" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520148"></a><figcaption>The wood now looks more like wood.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520148-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.07pm.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4520149,1300-4520150" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520149-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.12pm.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4520150-screenshot2025-06-24at1.51.22pm.png"></figure><p>Beyond visuals, Techland said composer Paweł Blaszczak came back to "give the soundtrack a complete remaster" with a unique twist.</p><p>"He even recreated that retro-tape sound by actually recording on tape!

And all of those had to be changed manually by our artists," lead 3D artist Krzysztof Knefel said.</p><p>The Retouched update doesn't require players to invest in new PC hardware, however, as Techland said it was important to keep the system requirements the same. The Retouched update is also available on PS4 and Xbox One, requiring Techland to test the game "endlessly" to ensure "we didn't run out of memory" for those older consoles.</p><p>The Retouched patch launches June 26 and it's free for everyone across PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. While the Retouched update promises improvements on all systems, Techland said, "the level of changes may vary by platform," but it didn't dig into specifics.</p><p>June 26 is also the date that CD Projekt Red planned to release Cyberpunk 2077's big new 2.3 update, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-big-new-update-delayed/1100-6532620/" data-ref-id="1100-6532620">it's been delayed</a>. Techland and CD Projekt are two of Poland's biggest developers, and fans of their games no longer have to decide what to play first on June 26.</p><p>Dying Light was followed up by 2022's Dying Light 2. The next entry in the series is Dying Light: The Beast, which launches in August for console and PC.</p>
