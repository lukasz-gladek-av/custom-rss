                <p>Toby Fox, the developer behind Deltarune, confirmed that chapters 3 and 4 of the game will be released sometime next year.</p><p>"I'm very eager to show you what we've made since six years ago. Chapter 3 and 4 will 100% come out in 2025," Fox said on Twitter. "The specific time is still relying on localization and console porting. Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1851836949847281963" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I'm very eager to show you what we've made since 6 years ago.<br>Chapter 3&amp;4 will 100% come out in 2025.<br>The specific time is still relying on localization and console porting.<br>Please hear me clawing at the door trying to escape the shallow coffin I have been buried in.</p>  â€” tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1851836949847281963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The first chapter of Deltarune was released back in 2018 and the second chapter was released in 2021. The first two chapters of Deltarune are available for free on PC, PS4, and Switch. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 will be paid releases, but it's unknown how much they will cost at the moment. However, we now at least have a timeframe on the game's future.</p><p>Deltarune is the follow-up to the wildly successful Undertale, and they both share elements with each other. Both of their names are anagrams of each other, and Deltarune has alternate versions of characters from Undertale.</p><p>Deltarune's Chapter 2 made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-of-2021-how-deltarune-chapter-2-portrays-a-disturbingly-dark-relationship/1100-6499235/" data-ref-id="1100-6499235">GameSpot's Best of 2021</a>. GameSpot said, "While the chapters are short, they're hard to put down, and once you've started playing, it's tough to stop until you've hit the endpoint."</p>
