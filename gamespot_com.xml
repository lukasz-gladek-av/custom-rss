                <p>Next month, Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher is coming out of retirement in a new Netflix animated series, Splinter Cell: Deathwatch. While the show will feature a new story that's not adapted from the games, the latest trailer for Deathwatch reveals that one of the primary adversaries is someone with a link to Sam's past.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A9iFjaKeMk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4A9iFjaKeMk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-puts-sam-fisher-back-in-action/1100-6534204/" data-ref-id="1100-6534204">previous trailer for Deathwatch</a> had a quick glimpse of a gravestone for Douglas Shetland, who was a character in the Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory games. Douglas was also one of Sam's closest friends, but when he turned against his country, Sam felt there was no other choice but to kill him.</p><p>This trailer briefly revisits the final moments of Doug's life before jumping back to his grave. Sam's decision appears to be coming back to haunt him, now that Douglas' daughter, Diana Shetland, has emerged as the CEO of Xanadu, the corporation that's pulling the strings of a new crisis.</p><p>Liev Schreiber is stepping into the role of Sam for the series. Michael Ironside has voiced Sam in most of the Splinter Cell video games to date, but the role was also played by Eric Johnson in Splinter Cell: Blacklist, the most recent game in the series. The Sandman's Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing a new agent, Zinnia McKenna, alongside Janet Varney as Anna "Grim" Grímsdóttir, and Joel Oulette as Thunder.</p><p>John Wick co-creator Derek Kolstad is the head writer and producer for Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, and the animation was provided by Sun Creature Studio and Fost. Netflix will debut the series on October 14.</p><p>On the video game front, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splinter-cell-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-548587">a Splinter Cell remake</a> in development, but there hasn't been many updates about that game since it was announced in 2022. Earlier this year, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shows-it-hasnt-totally-forgotten-about-splinter-cell/1100-6531177/" data-ref-id="1100-6531177">added Steam achievements to Splinter Cell: Blacklist</a>, which was released in 2013.</p>

                <p>EA's new Skate game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-skate-game-in-15-years-is-out-now-and-its-free/1100-6534774/" data-ref-id="1100-6534774">the first in 15 years</a>--launched today into early access, and the free-to-play game is proving popular enough that players are facing server queues due to the player load. Developer Full Circle has now reacted to player complaints about server queues. At the same time, people are logging into the game to find it requires a constant internet connection--something Full Circle warned about months ago but isn't going down well with the community today</p><h2><strong>Server queues</strong></h2><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968012562668179865" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, developer Full Circle said there are "a LOT" of players trying to join the Skate servers today for launch, and that to mitigate the issues, server queues have been put in place. Full Circle said the studio is "on it" and will undertake efforts to improve wait times.</p><p>Server queues are nothing new for online games. EA's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> has server queues for its recent multiplayer beta, for example. They can still be annoying, though, as players understandably do not want to wait to play. Some people in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skate subreddit</a> have said they finally got to the front of the queue and joined a session, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1nioad0/this_sucks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only to be kicked out due to server issues</a></p><hr><h2><strong>Always-online complaints</strong></h2><p>The new Skate is an always-online game--something Full Circle disclosed back in April. At the time, the developer said this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/" data-ref-id="1100-6531121">necessary due to how the new Skate was designed.</a></p><p>"The game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving," the studio said. "You'll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities."</p><p>Full Circle added: "In order to deliver on our vision of a skateboarding world, the game will always require a live connection."</p><p>But now that Skate has gone live, many are expressing frustration with the always-online requirement. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/top/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Many posts in the Skate subreddit </a>include people voicing their frustration with this, prompting some people to call on EA and Full Circle to release an offline mode.</p><p>Given what Full Circle has said about always-online being a core part of Skate's design, that might be wishful thinking.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeGXanmlJ_0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DeGXanmlJ_0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>Skate is not 1.0 yet</strong></h2><p>The new Skate launched today as an early access product, meaning development is not finished and that, as with other unfinished games, there are going to be bugs and other oddities that players encounter. Full Circle has said it will pore over the feedback from the early access launch to try to improve the experience.</p><h2><strong>Steam stats</strong></h2><p>At launch, Skate has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">already surpassed 78,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>, making it the No. 10 most-played game on Steam right now. And that's just a fraction of the game's total audience, as it's also available elsewhere on PC and on PlayStation and Xbox consoles.</p>

Blizzard has sold mounts, pets, helmets, and armor sets for real money for years now. Two years ago, Blizzard sold its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rare-world-of-warcraft-mount-returns-but-itll-cost-you-90/1100-6527385/" data-ref-id="1100-6527385">most expensive WoW mount ever</a>, the Trader's Gilded Brutosaur, for $90.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzBU3fGYrC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xzBU3fGYrC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-ascended-regalia-pack?_gl=1*1p05vyl*_ga*MTc5OTA4NDAyMy4xNzI5MTA1NTIz*_ga_8HJGPB88F9*czE3NTU3NTU4NDYkbzUkZzEkdDE3NTU3NTU4ODAkajI2JGwwJGgw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ascended Regalia Pack</a>, however, stands out, but not because of the $30 price tag. Instead, the Spirit Healer-themed bundle is notable because it includes a whopping 100 individual transmog pieces, with four full armor sets and 22 weapon appearances. Blizzard clearly thinks it's a big deal, as it's the only time in recent memory that it has crafted a trailer for a premium cosmetic bundle. Because they are all individual pieces, players can mix and match parts of the armor sets to create their own look, or combine them with their existing transmog collection to create something new.</p><p dir="ltr">While the sheer number of appearances is eye catching, the bundle is essentially two different armor sets recolored into blue and purple, as well as purple and blue versions of different weapons. That does make it a little less impressive than it initially sounds, but 100 transmog pieces is still nothing to sneeze at.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4569150,1300-4569151,1300-4569152" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569150-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-1_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569151-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-3_1920x1080_jl01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4569152-wow_11.1.7_tww_spiritplume-megabundle_bnetshop_productassetgallery-2_1920x1080_jl01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whether or not players will be interested in buying the bundle remains to be seen, but Blizzard has clearly found success selling cosmetics and mounts in the past. A <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-likely-earned-over-15-million-with-a-single-mount-traders-gilded-361569" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report</a> earlier this year estimated Blizzard may have made around $15 million selling the aforementioned Brutosaur mount.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard recently detailed how WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion, set to release in early 2026, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-finally-making-transmog-much-cheaper-and-more-convenient/1100-6534017/" data-ref-id="1100-6534017">overhaul the game's transmog system to make it cheaper</a> and more convienent. Transmog changes will soon be tied to item slots instead of items themselves, meaning players will be more easily able to maintain their desired look even while frequently finding new gear while leveling up or upgrading over the course of a season. That will also make transmog much cheaper, as players will be able to build transmog sets and pay a one-time cost rather than having to pay a gold cost to reapply appearances.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">Midnight will overhaul some of WoW's existing Blood Elf zones</a> to bring them in line with the game's more modern style.
