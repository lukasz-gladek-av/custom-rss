                <p>Starfield has crossed a new player milestone, reaching 15 million players, as developer Bethesda Game Studios also released a new update that includes the next land vehicle, a new quest, fixes, and more.</p><p>Starfield reached 6 million players on launch day--September 7, 2023--becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-already-has-over-6-million-players-making-it-bethesdas-biggest-launch-of-all-time/1100-6517567/" data-ref-id="1100-6517567">biggest launch in Bethesda's history</a>, and a launch no doubt fueled by Game Pass. The game climbed to 13 million players as of December 2023, and has now added at least two million more.</p><p>"We're thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback. We are always looking for ways to improve your experience playing the game," <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield/article/mqjRpu4DgOPKOdHE20SC1/starfields-november-update-is-now-live?utm_source=Community&amp;utm_medium=Social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bethesda said in a news release.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BotRDlQZYhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BotRDlQZYhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Starfield's November update is out now, introducing performance and stability improvements, along with the reintroduction of the uncapped frame rate option on Xbox Series X. Additionally, all Starfield Creations released through Bethesda's Verified Creators program will now work with achievements. Previously, select Creations blocked achievements, but this has now been fixed. However, achievements will not retroactively unlock.</p><p>Additionally, the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, is available now for everyone. "Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes," Bethesda said, noting that it has "exceptional handling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwankF0m64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urwankF0m64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, in the spirit of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday in the US, Starfield has added what's called "The Perfect Recipe." This is a new quest where players meet a person, Harbhajan, who is a gifted mechanic with a passion for cooking. "When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan--a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life," Bethesda said. "Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?"</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below. Starfield is available now for Xbox and PC.</p><h2><strong>Starfield November patch notes:</strong></h2><p><strong>General</strong></p><ul><li>General performance and stability improvements.</li><li>The uncapped frame rate option is available again for Xbox Series X users.</li><li>The Message of the Day now displays more consistently on the Xbox.</li><li>Addressed an issue where some console commands did not disable certain achievements.</li><li>Shattered Space will now show ownership correctly for Steam users.</li></ul><p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul><li>Creation Kit: Lipsync animation data generation is now available.</li></ul><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><ul><li>The Annihilator Particle Beam damage-over-time effect no longer triggers companion reactions.</li><li>Resolved a Leadership skill issue that could cause companions to not speak up.</li><li>Improved function of the stealth bar while around crowd NPCs.</li><li>Addressed an issue where destroyed ships could load in without collision.</li><li>Addressed an issue where loading a save the relied on missing content could place the player in an undesirable location.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Roach will now accurately track the number of completed bounties.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets will now appear in Akila, Gagarin, and Cydonia.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Fixed an issue where the player could receive additional credits by extorting the target and then killing them.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets should now have a larger variety of appearances.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Bounty targets will now be removed after being dealt with and leaving the area.</li><li>Trackers Alliance - Extorting or bribing a bounty target is no longer a guaranteed success.</li></ul><p><strong>Quests</strong></p><ul><li>The Starjacker - The correct quest objective will display when the player boards the Junker Watchdog.</li><li>Legacy of the Fang - Addressed an issue that could cause the key to no longer open the door if the player had left the area.</li><li>The Duel - If the player attacks Danika and gets arrested, they are now able to speak to her afterwards to complete the quest.</li><li>The Scaled Citadel - Anasko’s ID Key is now flagged as a quest item.</li><li>What Remains - Addressed an issue where having certain creations installed could make the hatch on The Oracle non-interactable.</li><li>What Remains - The Engineering Bay Access Card is now flagged as a quest item.</li><li>A House Divided - The doors in the Radiology center will stay unlocked during this quest if the player exits the area and returns.</li><li>A House Divided - The player can now obtain the keycard from Madri after the quest is completed.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Fixed an issue that could occur if the Va’ruun Zealots at the exterior of Shadow Station Epsilon were killed before receiving the quest.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Addressed an issue that could prevent the player from speaking to Razma or Viktor if the quest “Conflict in Conviction” is started at the same time.</li><li>Zealous Overreach - Vortex Phantoms will no longer spawn close enough to interrupt the negotiation scene.</li></ul>

                <p>For the past eight years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-go-review/1900-6416477/" data-ref-id="1900-6416477">Pokemon Go</a> players have helped make Niantic's game one of the top titles in mobile gaming. Apparently, players have also been helping Niantic create a 3D model of the world, which is being expanded via AI into a Large Geospatial Model.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic made <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the largely unnoticed announcement</a> earlier this month. These plans have seemingly been in the works for a long time, and the company states that it is attempting to "help computers perceive, comprehend, and navigate the physical world." It also compares Large Geospatial Models to the Large Language Models used by OpenAI's GPT, Grok, and others.</p><p>Because Pokemon Go players are able to visit locations that cars can't access, they've given Niantic views of buildings and areas that other models haven't been able to see until now. Niantic explained that only the fronts of buildings have been identifiable from previous models, but the Large Geospatial Models can teach computers how to see and identify the other sides of buildings on a global scale.</p><p>One way Pokemon Go players have unwittingly contributed to this is through the recently released Pokemon Playgrounds feature, which lets them leave behind a Pokemon at a specific spot that can be found by other players. Niantic states that 10 million locations have been scanned through that feature from around the world, and 1 million new scans arrive every week.</p><p>According to the map of the model on Niantic's site, the company is far from mapping the entire globe. Most of the locations captured appear to be in North America and Europe, while Africa, Australia, and a large portion of Asia remain uncaptured for now. South America also has a long way to go before it will be fully captured by Niantic's AI model.</p><p>Outside of Pokemon Go, the franchise continues to thrive.

Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-out-now/1100-6527486/" data-ref-id="1100-6527486">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, one of the franchise's other mobile games, attracted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-pushes-past-30-million-downloads-tops-app-store-chart/1100-6527660/" data-ref-id="1100-6527660">30 million downloads</a> in its first week alone.

                <p>Blizzard has revealed its new Overwatch 2 hero, Hazard, in an animated trailer. Ahead of the launch of season 14 on December 10, you'll be able to play with the character from November 22-25.</p><p>Named Hazardous Tactics, the animated trailer showcases a heist on Oasis, spearheaded by The Phreaks gang. Hazard, nicknamed Haz by the video captions, fuses himself with a strange substance to gain supernatural strength, with visible spikes around his body. In addition, he has a minigun for a right arm, and a Scottish accent. Developer Activision Blizzard said there'll be new details on Hazard and his abilities later this week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR8N3cXWxqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sR8N3cXWxqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">Overwatch: Classic</a> is still available in Overwatch 2 until December 2. In this mode, you can only access the original roster of 21 heroes, as well as their original abilities. If you miss the old-school depictions of some of the available characters, Overwatch: Classic should scratch that nostalgic itch.</p><p>If you miss the 6v6 player matches from the first Overwatch, don't fret. The developer will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">conducting tests</a> during Season 14--the first will require a hero in each role, while the second test, slated for later in the season, will involve a classic 2-2-2 role composition with some tweaks.</p>

                <p>The topic of AI is already clouding the outlook of various industries, including video games. No one knows what that will mean for the future of game development, but Remedy--the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">Alan Wake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-ultimate-edition-cloud-version-review/1900-6417600/" data-ref-id="1900-6417600">Control</a>--has clarified its stance on the topic while revealing that the company has utilized it for years.</p><p>"AI is a very wide topic," said chief technology officer Mika Vehkala during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy's recent financial presentation</a>. "Remedy has been using various AI models and techniques before the recent emergence and interest towards [it] happened.

We are actually using some of these tools that are more popular and suit our needs at the moment."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7o3vvH49IM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I7o3vvH49IM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vehkala and chief product officer Markus Mäki also stressed that Remedy isn't using AI to replace creative jobs or actors. Instead, the company is using the technology to handle the "dull" parts of game development like tracking movements through motion-capture performances. Vehkala also disclosed that Remedy has a dedicated person at the company whose job requires them to keep an eye on the emerging tech. But he added that Remedy is not rushing into it.</p><p>In October, Remedy shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedys-control-multiplayer-game-revealed-as-fbc-firebreak/1100-6527233/" data-ref-id="1100-6527233">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the upcoming spin-off from Control that will be released in 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alan-wake-2-dlc-has-a-teaser-for-control-2/1100-6527341/" data-ref-id="1100-6527341">Alan Wake 2's DLC</a> was recently revealed to have a teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-2-will-lean-more-into-rpg-mechanics/1100-6527864/" data-ref-id="1100-6527864">Control 2</a>. That game doesn't currently have a release window. But those aren't the only titles among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/">Remedy's future games</a> that could be affected by the company's use of AI.</p>
