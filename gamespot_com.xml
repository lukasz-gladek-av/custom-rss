                <p>Rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-coming/1100-6515623/" data-ref-id="1100-6515623">a remake of Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag</a> have been circulating since 2023, but they're picking up momentum in 2025. Ubisoft has yet to officially announce Black Flag's return to modern consoles and PC, but voice actor Matt Ryan recently hinted that a remake is on the way.</p><p>On social media, an X user going by @TheRealZephryss shared a video from <a href="https://x.com/SuperDropKick17" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@SuperDropKick17</a> that features Ryan signing autographs at a convention. Ryan--who voiced Black Flag's leading character, Edward Kenway--was asked if he had beaten the game and he affirmed that he had. Ryan then noted that he may need to beat the game again. "There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything," added Ryan.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/therealzephryss/status/1939392046151926243?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Edward Kenway's voice actor, Matt Ryan, said this during a fan interaction.

The hosts appeared to be confused about whether a Black Flag remake was announced, but went on to say that "there‚Äôs going to be something going on with Edward, and our PVC ‚Öõ scale statue will reflect that accordingly."</p><p>Last year, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-assassins-creed-remakes-in-the-works-including-potentially-black-flag/1100-6524576/" data-ref-id="1100-6524576">are multiple Assassin's Creed remakes in the works</a>, which will offer modern touches to the classic games.</p><p>In the meantime, the latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-notes-include-critical-role-collab-new-difficulty-mode/1100-6532694/" data-ref-id="1100-6532694">a new update</a> last week that includes a Critical Role collaboration and a new difficulty mode.</p>

The number of concurrent players has dropped so rapidly that Wilds' predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-wont-stop-buying-monster-hunter-world/1100-6529492/" data-ref-id="1100-6529492">Monster Hunter World</a>, has a higher count. Today, Capcom is attempting to address PC players' issues as part of the massive Free Title Update 2. The publisher has also shared a glimpse at the next two free updates beyond this one.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAf4Z4rCpK4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GAf4Z4rCpK4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Free Title Update 2 doesn't make any changes to Wilds' minimum or recommended system requirements, the Steam version has been adjusted to amount of VRAM used in texture streaming to lower the amount of VRAM overall. One of the bug fixes will also make the Estimated VRAM Usage display the correct amount in Display Settings and Graphics Settings.</p><p>It's too soon to say whether these changes alone will turn things around for Wilds on Steam, but Capcom notes that further performance and optimization improvements are still in the works. Across all platforms, Free Title Update is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-next-update-adds-lagiacrus-seregios-and-underwater-combat/1100-6532767/" data-ref-id="1100-6532767">adding two new monsters</a>, Lagiacrus and Seregios, as well as underwater combat.</p><p>Some of the smaller changes in this update include easier access to the map, which can now be opened even when major chat notifications are on the screen. Wilds will no longer be automatically switching to area hierarchy when players are focused on the large monsters on the map.</p><p>Weapon balance changes have been made for Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun, with more adjustments to be added in August. Looking ahead to Free Title Update 3, Capcom expects to release it in September with a new level of quest difficulty with unique rewards which can be used for a new Talisman crafting system. The Talismans can be "assigned a wide variety of skills," including some related directly to weapons and armor. Free Title Update 4 will follow in the winter with another new monster and "more challenging elements."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1938591901378040197" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">[Future Update Plans]<br>So far, we have discussed what we will be addressing in the second Free Title Update, however we feel there are still many points of feedback and requests to address.

The other half is fending off a parade of increasingly absurd, terrifying, and sometimes outright beautiful bosses, not to mention reaping the rewards of defeating them. From bouncing blue blobs to cosmic eldritch horrors, this guide covers every major boss fight in the sidescroller, whether you‚Äôre playing on PC, console, or mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">Breaking down all Terraria bosses in order, you‚Äôll spot summoning tips, combat strategies, and info on the drops you'll receive. You'll encounter some beasts naturally as you go about your peaceful mining expedition, while others require a bit of know-how with summon items.</p><p dir="ltr">Be warned, this guide contains spoilers, just in case you‚Äôd prefer to go into these battles blind. And, for the love of Torch God, make sure you‚Äôre decked out in the right weapons and accessories before you go picking a fight with the hardest Terraria bosses at the end of the list.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode_Bosses">Pre-Hardmode Bosses</a><ul><li><a href="#King_Slime__Optional_">King Slime (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</a></li><li><a href="#Eater_of_Worlds__Corruption_only_">Eater of Worlds (Corruption only)</a></li><li><a href="#Brain_of_Cthulhu__Crimson_only_">Brain of Cthulhu (Crimson only)</a></li><li><a href="#Queen_Bee">Queen Bee</a></li><li><a href="#Skeletron">Skeletron</a></li><li><a href="#Deerclops">Deerclops</a></li><li><a href="#Wall_of_Flesh">Wall of Flesh</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode_Bosses">Hardmode Bosses</a><ul><li><a href="#Queen_Slime__Optional_">Queen Slime (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#The_Twins">The Twins</a></li><li><a href="#The_Destroyer">The Destroyer</a></li><li><a href="#Skeletron_Prime">Skeletron Prime</a></li><li><a href="#Plantera">Plantera</a></li><li><a href="#Golem">Golem</a></li><li><a href="#Empress_of_Light__Optional_">Empress of Light (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Duke_Fishron__Optional_">Duke Fishron (Optional)</a></li><li><a href="#Lunatic_Cultist">Lunatic Cultist</a></li><li><a href="#Moon_Lord__Final_Boss_">Moon Lord (Final Boss)</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode_Bosses">Pre-Hardmode Bosses</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="King_Slime__Optional_">King Slime (Optional)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519203" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519203"></a><figcaption>King Slime</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519203-all-terraria-bosses-king-slime.jpg"></figure><p>A giant, jiggly blob with a crown and a penchant for teleportation. King Slime is often your first real test of boss combat and crowd control. Despite its size, it is one of the most mobile bosses at this stage, frequently teleporting to close the gap when players run too far away. The more you damage it, the smaller King Slime gets, until it resembles the ordinary slimes that bother you in your day-to-day adventures.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use a Slime Crown or</p><p dir="ltr">World: Wait for a Slime Rain event or take your chances on the grassy areas on the outer rim of the map.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 2,000 on Classic / 2,800 on Expert / 3,570 on Master.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 40 on Classic / 64 on Expert / 96 on Master.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Keep your distance and stay mobile. Ranged and magic weapons work best early on. You can even abuse King Slime's teleportation mechanic by running off-screen and trapping it in nooks. Later on in the game, when you have access to more equipment, you can craft traps such as lava pits using a lava bucket, or take a page out of Obi-Wan‚Äôs book and use Rocket Boots or Wings to gain the high ground over your opponent. If you‚Äôre going after King Slime with a group, make sure you spread out to avoid him teleporting directly on top of your group.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Slime Gun, Slime Hook, Ninja armour pieces, Solidifier, Slimy Saddle mount, Mask, Trophy</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Nothing special happens after defeating King Slime, as it‚Äôs an optional boss.</p><h3 id="Eye_of_Cthulhu">Eye of Cthulhu</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519199" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519199"></a><figcaption>Eye of Cthulhu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519199-all-terraria-bosses-eye-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg"></figure><p>The gateway horror of Terraria. If you hear roaring at night, you‚Äôre about to get your eyeballs handed to you. This flying monstrosity starts off with lazy circular attack patterns that ignore blocks as if they‚Äôre nothing, and summons Servants of Cthulhu for a helping hand. Once you whittle it down to below half health (or under 65% health in Expert+), Eye of Cthulhu transforms into a toothy nightmare with ramped-up aggression, switching to wild charges. At this point, it‚Äôs defenseless but deals higher damage, ditching numbers in favour of a one-on-one fight.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use a Suspicious Looking Eye at night.</p><p dir="ltr">World: One in three chance of spawning at night once you have three NPCs in housing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 2,800 on Classic / 3,640 on Expert / 4,641 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 15 on Classic / 30 on Expert / 45 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Prepare ahead of time by creating an arena and setting up plenty of light sources. As with any nighttime boss, the sooner you start the fight after sunset, the more time you have to get the job done before Eye of Cthulhu disappears. Dodge its charge attacks and whittle it down with bows or wands. The second phase is faster, so be ready to dash or grapple away. Any accessories that boost movement speed (like the Hermes Boots) are a game-changer here.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Demonite/Crimtane Ore, Unholy Arrows, Mask, Trophy, Binoculars.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Defeating Eye of Cthulhu allows Dryad to move in and gives the Traveling Merchant a chance to sell a yoyo called Code 1 for five gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eater_of_Worlds__Corruption_only_">Eater of Worlds (Corruption only)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519198" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519198"></a><figcaption>Eater of Worlds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519198-all-terraria-bosses-eater-of-worlds.jpg"></figure><p>A segmented worm that tunnels through your nightmares and your base. The Eater of Worlds battle is a fight of endurance and control, where the wrong move can split the boss into a mess of deadly, individual threats if you aren‚Äôt careful. It will only spawn in worlds with Corruption, which is one of two evil biomes, alongside Crimson. Both cannot co-exist, leaving you with a 50/50 chance of fighting this burrowing beast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong>:</p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use Worm Food in a Corruption biome.</p><p dir="ltr">World: Destroy 3 Shadow Orbs in a Corruption biome.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 7,500 on Legacy builds / 10,050 on Classic / 15,120 on Expert / 19,224 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Equip yourself with piercing or area-of-effect (AoE) weapons like Vilethorn or grenades for large amounts of damage to the entire worm. Lure Eater of Worlds to a surface-built arena designed to give you more manoeuvrability. Aim for body segments, preferably the head or tail, to avoid splitting it early. If you destroy the middle section, it will split into two monsters that‚Äôll attack you separately. Multiple players can take out separate segments faster--just don‚Äôt let your allies get overwhelmed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Shadow Scales, Demonite Ore, Eater's Bone, Mask, Trophy</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Eater of Worlds is a primary source of materials you need to progress, but there is a possibility you can accrue enough Demonite naturally throughout the world to move onto the next stages without fighting it.</p><h3 id="Brain_of_Cthulhu__Crimson_only_">Brain of Cthulhu (Crimson only)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519195" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519195"></a><figcaption>Brain of Cthulhu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4519195-all-terraria-bosses-brain-of-cthulhu-first-form.jpg"></figure><p>The squishier, trickier cousin to the Eater of Worlds, Brain of Cthulhu leans heavily on illusion and misdirection. The fight opens with a swarm of Creepers that must be cleared before the real battle begins, and the brain‚Äôs teleporting, duplicating phase two can catch unprepared players off guard. Just as with its counterpart, this critical thinker will only appear in the Crimson biome, which won‚Äôt spawn if Corruption is present.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong>:</p><p dir="ltr">Item: Use a Bloody Spine in the Crimson.</p><p dir="ltr">World: Break 3 Crimson Hearts in the Crimson.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 1,250 on Classic / 2,125 on Expert / 2,709 on Master - x2.6 with Creepers</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: 14 on Classic / 54 on Expert / 81 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: The first phase of this battle floods you with Creepers that you must destroy before you can fight the Brain itself. AoE helps here, clearing waves quickly, and they‚Äôll drop hearts fast to help keep your health high. In phase two, rapid dashing and illusions make this a dodge-heavy fight. You‚Äôll need to keep the battle within the Crimson biome so as not to risk the demon despawning, so ensure all pre-built arenas stay within the red boundary (you can use the background as a good indicator).</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Brain of Cthulhu Relic, Brain in a Jar, Treasure bag with either Tissue Samples, Brain of Confusion, Mask, Trophy, Crimtane Ore, or Bone Rattle pet</p><p><strong>Aftermath</strong>: Brain of Cthulhu offers materials you need to progress in bulk, although you can still mine Crimtane Ore throughout the world without ever taking the fight.</p><h3 id="Queen_Bee">Queen Bee</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519253-all-terraria-bosses-queen-bee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519253-all-terraria-bosses-queen-bee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519253"></a><figcaption>Queen Bee</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519253-all-terraria-bosses-queen-bee.jpg"></figure><p>Often summoned by accident when exploring the Jungle, Queen Bee is both graceful and aggressive. She darts across the screen, spewing stingers and summoning swarms of bees to overwhelm the player. Despite her elegance, she‚Äôs a deadly gatekeeper to Jungle loot and late Pre-Hardmode gear. This one stings in several ways. Not only can it be a tough brawl, but you can‚Äôt help but feel like the villain when she‚Äôs only trying to avenge her larva and defend her home.

Skeletron is a classic boss with a two-part hitbox: You‚Äôll need to deal with flailing arms before the real damage begins on the head. His spinning attack can rip through unprepared players, so practice your dodging beforehand.

It‚Äôs easy enough to block a lot of attacks by putting up solid blocks you can peek out from behind to deal magic or ranged damage.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Ancient Manipulator, Lunatic Cultist Mask, Lunatic Cultist Trophy</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Aftermath</strong>: With the Ancient Manipulator, you can start crafting endgame items.</p><h3 id="Moon_Lord__Final_Boss_">Moon Lord (Final Boss)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519263-all-terraria-bosses-moon-lord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519263" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519263-all-terraria-bosses-moon-lord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519263"></a><figcaption>Moon Lord</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4519263-all-terraria-bosses-moon-lord.jpg"></figure><p>To no one's surprise, given the wealth of bosses who share his namesake, Cthulhu himself is Terraria‚Äôs true final challenge, with a tentacle beard in tow. Moon Lord, as he‚Äôs officially called, is a triple-eyed nightmare, complete with laser beams, leeching tongues, and a heart-core that must be exposed and destroyed. There‚Äôs a reason the Dryads banished him to the moon, leaving only his organs behind.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Summoning</strong></p><p dir="ltr">World: Automatically appears after all Celestial Pillars are destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Health</strong>: 145,000 on Classic / 217,500 on Expert / 277,311 on Master</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Damage</strong>: Varies per attack on all modes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Strategy</strong>: Moon Lord‚Äôs vulnerability to debuffs plays a large role in speeding up the fight, but you‚Äôll need to keep re-applying them every time he closes his eyes to revitalize himself. Target the eyes, especially the forehead laser. Avoid standing still and dodge everything you can, as tanking isn‚Äôt much of an option here. And finally, lifesteal goes a long way to keeping you pumped for the long fight ahead.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Rewards</strong>: Meowmere, Star Wrath, Rainbow Crystal Staff, Terrarian, Last Prism, Lunar Flare, Celebration Mk2, S.D.M.G., Lunar Portal Staff, Portal Gun, Mask, Trophy, Meowmere Minecart.
