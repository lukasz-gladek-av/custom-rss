                <p>Developer Neon Giant has teased an announcement on December 11, the same day as The Game Awards, for a project that the team is calling "ludicrously ambitious." That's some bonafide marketing hype, and the Swedish developer isn't revealing much more beyond that the game will focus on "player agency."</p><p>The developer added that the game will be set in a "reactive" world where "player agency and creativity" are two defining elements. It's "the kind of game that every developer wants to work on," the developer said in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/we-called-its-first-cyberpunk-setting-cooler-than-night-city-and-now-the-studio-behind-the-ascent-says-its-making-the-kind-of-game-that-every-developer-wants-to-work-on/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer.</a></p><p>Neon Giant previously made The Ascent, and after that game's success, studio co-founder Arcade Berg said the studio could have "asked for nearly anything" from the publishers that came calling.</p><p>Neon Giant was sold in 2022 to South Korean gaming company Krafton, the publisher of PUBG, and Berg said he and co-founder Tor Frick took the deal because they "didn't start a studio to run a studio."</p><p>"We started [Neon Giant] because we wanted to make games in a certain way," Berg said. "That's the only thing that's really important to us. So we said, well, you know what? Why not? Why not find someone to work with so we can get the rocket fuel that we feel that we need to be even more ambitious, and also feel that we have some stability, we can have the courage and afford to take risks, creative risks and project risks, because we think that will lead to a frankly cooler product in the end."</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, and GameSpot will bring you all the news and reveals as they happen.
