          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Fairgame$ - CGI Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games</p>
      </div>
<p>Drapeau left Haven weeks ago, and said in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn post</a> that they're joining WB Games Montreal as a creative director for an upcoming project. "Let's do this!" Drapeau said.</p><p>Drapeau is a video game industry veteran, having started back in 2006 in testing and internship positions with VMC and Odd1 before joining Ubisoft in 2007 as a game designer. Drapeau was later promoted to lead game designer on Rainbow Six Siege before leaving to join Eidos-Montreal in 2017 to work on Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Drapeau re-joined Ubisoft in 2019 and worked at the company for two years before moving to Haven in 2021.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Drapeau is working on at WB Games Montreal, but the studio was said to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">pitching a new Game of Thrones game earlier this year.</a> The studio assisted Rocksteady with 2024's underperforming Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and also made 2022's Gotham Knights.</p><p>As for Haven and Fairgame$, the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/" data-ref-id="1100-6531583">now reportedly coming in Spring 2026</a>, putting it in the vicinity of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> in May 2026.</p><h2><strong>What is Fairgame$ all about?</strong></h2><p>As you can see in the announcement trailer, Fairgame$ has players going after billionaires who have "too much money and too much power." In the trailer, we see a squad of players infiltrating some kind of compound, working together to take down security guards with the apparent aim of sticking it to the man.</p><p>"Fairgame$ will give you an opportunity to break the rules as a modern-day Robin Hood, a thrill seeker, or just someone who wants to collect cool loot," creative director Mathieu Leduc said. "Trespass inside forbidden locations around the world, fill your pockets like a kid in a candy store and unravel the nefarious plans of untouchable billionaires."</p><h2>Trouble with Sony's live-service push</h2><p>Back when Fairgame$ was announced in 2023, Sony was in the midst of a huge push and investment into the live-service market. At one point in time, Sony wanted to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-projects-launching-12-live-service-games-by-2025/1100-6503924/" data-ref-id="1100-6503924">12 live-service games over the coming years</a> (alongside its commitment to single-player games). However, in May 2023, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/" data-ref-id="1100-6519039">halving its planned live-service game output</a>, with management stressing it wanted to focus on quality over quantity. After this announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">Naughty Dog's The Last of Us multiplayer game was canceled</a> in December 2023.</p><p>At the beginning of 2024, though, Sony found its biggest success to date in the live-service market with Helldivers 2--the game went on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-fastest-selling-playstation-game-ever/1100-6523423/" data-ref-id="1100-6523423">smash sales records</a> and become the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 overall best-selling game of 2024 in the US.</a> It recently came to Xbox, and, along with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">new update</a>, has seen a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">huge surge in popularity.</a></p><p>In August 2024, Sony launched the multiplayer game Concord. It had such a dismal performance out of the gate that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-now-being-removed-from-psn-accounts/1100-6526385/" data-ref-id="1100-6526385">Sony quickly took the game offline and refunded all players</a>. Its developer, Firewalk, was later closed. At the end of 2024, Sony confirmed that it canceled multiple projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">live-service God of War and another live-service title from Bend.</a></p><p dir="ltr">It was reported in 2023 that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan, who left Sony in 2024, had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-playstations-most-important-people-connie-booth-has-left-the-company-after-30-years/1100-6518727/">mandate that Sony's teams should make more games-as-a-service titles</a>. A number of PlayStation developers were reportedly upset with this, and the blame was said to have fallen not on Ryan but Connie Booth, one of the most important and veteran PlayStation developers, leading to her eventual departure.</p><p dir="ltr">Another former PlayStation boss, Shuhei Yoshida, recently said the chance of finding success in the competitive live-service market was "small," but his replacement, Hermen Hulst, was given the resources to fund both single-player games and live-service titles at the same time. However, had Yoshida stayed in that role, he said he would have <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/" rel="nofollow ">"tried to resist"</a> the push into the live-service market.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In July the United Kingdom's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Online Safety Act</a> came into effect, requiring that any form of online services feature age verification checks if these services contain content that could be deemed "harmful to children." This law has affected a range of websites, including social media sites like X, as well as sites that contain adult, 18+ content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-will-require-age-verification-beginning-in-2026-for-the-uk/1100-6533499/">even Xbox will require age verification in the UK come next year</a>. Now, Valve has introduced its own age verification process that requires users in the UK to register a credit card to their account in order to view certain games.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed on a new <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6" rel="nofollow">Steam support page</a> titled Age Assurance Under the UK Online Safety Act, Valve explains, "In order to access Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs, you need to be logged into an active user account and explicitly opt-in through the account settings page. For UK users, this opt-in process requires age verification. Your UK Steam user account is considered age verified for as long as a valid credit card is stored on the account."</p><p dir="ltr">Valve says that it uses this process as Ofcom, the UK's regulatory and competition authority, has said that credit card checks are very effective forms of age verification due to the fact you must be 18 to obtain one. GameSpot can also confirm that a UK debit card will not work in place of a credit card--in the UK children as young as 11 can get a debit card, which is likely why this is not offered as an option.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the Steam support page doesn't specify what constintutes a "mature" game--GameSpot can also confirm that games with violent and occasionally sexual content like Baldur's Gate 3 and Kingdom Come Deliverence 2 are still viewable, as well as controversial titles like Postal 2. Games where sexual content is a main feature appears to differ from title to title.</p><p dir="ltr">Steam isn't the only digital game storefront that has put restrictions in place regarding the Online Safety Act. <a href="https://itch.io/t/5133739/our-update-on-the-uk-online-safety-act" rel="nofollow">Itch.io has made it so that affected pages will be entirely unavailable in the UK</a> until it implements a third-party age verification process.</p>

                <p>The next big chapter in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> saga is now live--with detailed patch notes to boot--and with the armies of Super Earth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-xbox-trade-exclusives-today-with-helldivers-on-xbox-and-gears-on-ps5/1100-6534266/">being joined by new Xbox recruits</a>, it's time to explore uncharted territory. Into the Unjust will see Helldivers venture into subterranean Terminid lairs, hostile territory that cuts troopers off from their usual Super Destroyer support unless they find a gap in the structures. Just what secrets lie behind the mysterious Gloom shroud that has been seen on several Hive Worlds? You'll have to find out for yourself, but at least there's some neat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/">new armor and weapons you can equip</a> to help you in your fight.</p><p>As for the update, this will include the usual selection of gameplay tweaks, bug fixes, and new content. Hive Worlds with randomly generated cave systems will be introduced here, giving players a chance to discover "disgusting flora and fauna" amidst advanced Terminid species. These planets also feature acid lakes that you don't want to take a swim in, destructible walls in the cave systems, and dark zones where multi-legged horrors will be hiding.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Dust Devils Warbond Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>One of the new gameplay modes will also task you with taking control of a mobile oil rig to siphon the mysterious oily substance from these worlds, and for the new enemy types, developer Arrowhead is teasing four new Terminid breeds. Rupture Spewers can vomit a lethal substance on players, Rupture Warriors hide in the dark away to protect their organs from UV radiation, and Rupture Chargers can burrow through the ground to ambush Helldivers. Finally, Dragonroaches attack from the sky with an acid bombing run.</p><p>For the tweaks and fixes, Arrowhead has resolved the issue with one of the iconic Halo weapons in the ODST Warbond. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">The MA5C Assault Rifle was causing the game to crash</a> if a party leader had it equipped while on the bridge of their super destroyer, but this has now been patched. You can see the full list of patch notes below.</p><h2>Helldivers 2 PATCH 01.004.000 Notes</h2><h3>Hive Worlds</h3><ul><li>Randomly-generated giant cave systems</li><li>A new tactical challenge</li><li>Discover disgusting flora and fauna and advanced Terminid life</li><li>Hive World surface - acid lakes and advanced bug spires</li><li>Holes in the cave roof will allow stratagems to be called down</li><li>Destructible walls within the caves to navigate</li><li>Bring a flashlight!</li></ul><h3>Missions</h3><ul><li>Delve deep into the caves to destroy the Spore Lung and stop its infectious Gloom spread</li><li>Take control of the GATER mobile oil rig and siphon the mysterious oily substance from the surface of Hive Worlds</li><li>Undertake more missions to extract resources and destroy the enemy threat on Hive Worlds</li><li>Have Super Earth approved levels of fun!</li></ul><h3>New Enemies</h3><ul><li>Rupture Spewer; The foul Rupture Spewer bursts from the ground only to spew its undemocratic pestilence on the innocent.

Captured specimens prefer burrowing to open-air movement, a pattern indicative of subconscious shame at their own undemocratic ways.</li><li>Rupture Charger; When this armored beast senses the presence of Liberty, it buries itself underground to escape its light. Its Charger instincts compel it to tunnel through the ground at high speeds, emerging only to attack those who represent the Liberty that blinds it so.</li><li>Dragonroach; This oversized affront to Free skies everywhere circles its would-be prey, swooping down intermittently to bespew them with air-combustible acid. A spineless tactic befitting an exoskeletal monstrosity.</li></ul><h3>Balancing</h3><ul><li>Unified “non-explosive Orbitals” so they have the same projectile damage and destruction values as the Orbital gas.</li></ul><h3>Orbital smoke</h3><ul><li>Increased Projectile Damage from 0 to 300</li><li>Increased Projectile AP from 0 to 7</li><li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength from 30 to 50</li></ul><h3>Orbital EMS</h3><ul><li>Increased Projectile Damage from 250 to 300</li><li>Increased Projectile AP from 3 to 7</li><li>Increased Projectile Demolition strength from 30 to 50</li></ul><p>Unified Stun explosions work.
