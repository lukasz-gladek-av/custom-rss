                <p dir="ltr">2K and Firaxis Games are gearing up to add a whole new reality to the Civilization experience. Today, during the Civ World Summit livestream on the official Firaxis Games Twitch channel, the studios announced they will be bringing Sid Meier's Civilization VII--the latest installment in the strategy franchise--to virtual and mixed reality for the first time ever in Civilization VII VR for the Meta Quest 3 and 3S.</p><p dir="ltr">This new take on Civilization will position players above the playing area, which will be contained within a massive circular surface called the Command Table. Civ VII VR will support both single-player and online multiplayer modes, though online players will be limited to opponents also using a Meta Quest 3 or 3S.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4440558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4440558"></a><figcaption>The leaders seated around the Command Table.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Civilization VII VR will also support full virtual reality and mixed reality modes. With both options, players can give orders to their citizens from a far away, top-down perspective, or they can zoom in on the actions on the board by leaning forward while the little virtual citizens work on each project as instructed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full VR setting will see the player transported into a a massive museum, with the area outside of the museum tailored to that player's selected leader. Mixed reality, meanwhile, will place the surface of the Command Table onto a flat surface in the real-world physical space, transforming a kitchen table, for example, into an intense battleground.</p><p dir="ltr">Civilization VII VR is set to launch on Meta Quest 3 and 3S platforms in Spring 2025. It can be wishlisted now on both platforms via the Meta Store.</p>

<section><p>EA's predictions have been both eerily accurate and completely wrong in recent years. We're looking back at the past 10+ years to see how things have shaken out.</p></section>

                <p>Super Bowl LIX takes place this Sunday, February 9, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles duking it out for the title. EA Sports historically simulates the Big Game and releases the results of the match-up, and that continued in 2025 with EA's simulation predicting the Eagles will beat the Chiefs by a score of 23-21. The simulation also predicted that Eagles QB will be named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</p><p>Here are some further predictions from EA's Madden simulation of Super Bowl LIX, as written by EA:</p><ul><li><b>Final Score and MVP:</b> The Eagles edged the Chiefs 23-21 in a close back-and-forth game that came down to the final drive. Eagles QB Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</li><li><b>Early Game Dynamics:</b> The Eagles started strong with Saquon Barkley using his exceptional juking abilities to score the first touchdown. The Chiefs responded with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, but an interception by CJ Gardner-Johnson helped keep the game close.</li><li><b>Second Half Turnaround:</b> After the Chiefs led 14-10 at halftime, the Eagles took the lead in the third quarter on a touchdown pass from Hurts to A.J. Brown. A crucial defensive stand by the Eagles' line, particularly Jalen Carter, prevented the Chiefs from scoring on a fourth-down attempt.</li><li><b>Clutch Moments:</b> In the fourth quarter, Mahomes led a drive for a Chiefs touchdown, but the Eagles answered back with a field goal to regain the lead. The game came down to the wire with the Chiefs' final drive ending in a missed field goal, sealing the Eagles' victory.</li></ul><p>If you don't like this prediction or simply want to run your own, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/" data-ref-id="1100-6529306">download Madden NFL 25 on Game Pass today</a> and simulate the game for yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">EA's predictions in the past have been eerily accurate, like in 2015 when the simulation predicted the Patriots' comeback victory against the Seattle Seahawks--<em>and </em>the final score--along with the exact type of pass play that made it happen. It was spooky. But EA isn't always that accurate with its predictions. Sometimes, the simulation gets it very, very wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Big Game dominating the sporting world this week, we're looking back at the past 10 years of EA Sports Madden Super Bowl simulations and predictions. As you'll see, EA's track record for predicting the winner has been a mix.</p><p dir="ltr">EA got off to a hot start by accurately predicting the Super Bowl winners four straight years, from Super Bowl 38 to Super Bowl 41. Since then, however, the simulation never got it right more than two years in a row, but it also never got it wrong for more than two straight years.</p><p dir="ltr">What does it all mean? Looking at the past decade-plus, EA has accurately predicted the Super Bowl winner about 50% of the time, which is impressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Off the field, companies are spending <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" rel="nofollow ">as much as $8 million for 30-second advertisements on Fox</a>, which carries the game this year. This year, viewers can expect <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lot of ads about AI.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Here is a rundown of EA's Madden Super Bowl simulations over the past years, looking at what was predicted and then what actually happened in real life. Super Bowl 59 takes place Sunday, February 9, starting at 6:30 PM ET on Fox.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Madden Super Bowl Predictions Over The Years</strong></h2><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Super Bowl</th><th scope="col">EA Prediction</th><th scope="col">Actual Result</th><th scope="col">Right Or Wrong?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Super Bowl 59</p><p>Super Bowl 58</p><p>Super Bowl 57</p><p>Super Bowl 56</p><p>Super Bowl 55</p><p>Super Bowl 54</p></td><td><p><strong>PHI 23, KC 21</strong></p><p><strong>KC 30, SF 28</strong></p><p><strong>PHI 31, KC 17</strong></p><p><strong>LA 21, CIN 24</strong></p><p><strong>KC 37, TB 27</strong></p><p><strong>KC 35, SF 31</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>???</strong></p><p><strong>KC 25, SF 22</strong></p><p><strong>KC 38, PHI 35</strong></p><p><strong>LA 23, CIN 20</strong></p><p><strong>KC 9, TB 31</strong></p><p><strong>KC 31, SF 20</strong></p></td><td><p>Check back soon!</p><p>Right!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Right!</p></td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 53</td><td><strong>LA 30, NE 27 </strong></td><td><strong>NE 13, LA 3</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 52</td><td><strong>NE 24, PHI 20</strong></td><td><strong> PHI 41, NE 33</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 51</td><td><strong>NE 27, ATL 24</strong></td><td><strong>NE 34, ATL 28</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 50</td><td><strong>CAR 24, DEN 20 </strong></td><td><strong>DEN 24, CAR 10</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 49</td><td><strong>NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td><strong> NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td>Spooky Good!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 48</td><td><strong>DEN 31, SEA 28</strong></td><td><strong>SEA 43, DEN 8</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 47</td><td><strong>BAL 27, SF 24</strong></td><td><strong>BAL 34, SF 31</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 46</td><td><strong>NYG 27, NE 24 </strong></td><td><strong>NYG 21, NE 17</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr></tbody></table>
