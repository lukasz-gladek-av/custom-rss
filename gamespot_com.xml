                <p>A new God of War game is reportedly going to be released this year, and it's apparently a side-story involving Greece.</p><p>According to Giant Bomb's <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-new-god-of-war-side-story-project-set-in-greece-is-coming-this-year-its-claimed/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jeff Grubb</a>, the game is a brand-new title and not a remaster collection. It'll focus on Greek mythology rather than the Norse mythology found in God of War (2018) and Ragnarok. It's unclear what "side-story" means, but it's possible that it could be referring to a smaller kind of game that's too big to be standalone DLC. Examples include Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. God of War previously got several Greek-focused prequels, including two PSP games and God of War: Ascension on PS3.</p><p>The first three God of War games focused on Greek mythology. There <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-god-of-war-remasters-for-ps5-could-be-revealed-in-march/1100-6529692/" data-ref-id="1100-6529692">were rumors that a God of War remastered collection</a> was going to be announced for the franchise's 20th anniversary, but Sony clarified that no new games were going to be announced at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-wars-20th-anniversary-event-will-have-donuts-and-beach-towels-but-no-new-announcements/1100-6530004/" data-ref-id="1100-6530004">recent exhibition</a>. However, Sony did announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-gets-new-free-update-this-month-to-celebrate-the-franchises-20th-anniversary/1100-6530140/" data-ref-id="1100-6530140">Dark Odyssey cosmetic DLC</a> for the 20th anniversary.</p><p>A God of War TV show adaptation is also in the works, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">two seasons already ordered for Amazon TV</a>. Currently, it's unknown what developer Sony Santa Monica's next project is going to be. The studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-reportedly-working-on-a-new-ip/1100-6525531/" data-ref-id="1100-6525531">reportedly working on its first new IP</a> since God of War's debut in 2005.</p>

                <p>Palworld, the Pokemon-like game that became very popular in 2024 and led to a lawsuit from Nintendo and The Pokemon Company, has never been released for the Nintendo Switch. But could the game make its way to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>? We don't know, but Pocketpair's communications director, John Buckley, said in an interview that technical reasons are to blame for Palworld's absence on Switch so far.</p><p>"If we could make the game work on the Switch, we would, but Palworld is a beefy game," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is expected to have better specs, but Buckley said Pocketpair has not "seen those specs yet" for the upcoming console.</p><p>"Like everyone else, we're waiting," he said. "If [the Switch 2 is] beefy enough, it's 100% worth considering," he said. "We did a lot of optimization for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with. Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p><p>It's also an open question as to whether or not Nintendo would permit Pocketpair to release Palworld on Switch or Switch 2. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-launches-new-game-on-switch-in-middle-of-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6528719/#:~:text=Palworld%20developer%20Pocketpair%20has%20launched,tower%20defense%2C%20and%20roguelike%20elements." data-ref-id="1100-6528719">Pocketpair's Overdungeon launched on Switch earlier this year</a> amid the lawsuit against Nintendo and The Pokemon Company.</p><p>Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are suing Pocketpair for patent infringement related to mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD).</a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/huge-palworld-update-adds-cross-play-photo-mode-and-new-pal-storage/1100-6530211/" data-ref-id="1100-6530211">Palworld just got a huge new update that added, among other things, cross-play and a photo mode</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows hit shelves at a crucial point in Ubisoft's history, with some analysts going so far as to call it an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-is-bit-of-an-existential-moment-for-ubisoft-analyst-says/1100-6530208/">existential moment</a>" for the company. If reported player counts are any indication, Ubisoft's prayers may indeed be answered thanks to the Assassins Order's latest adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft itself reported two million players have entered the AC version of feudal Japan since the game's launch on March 20. While two million players does not equate to two million copies sold--Shadows is available to Ubisoft+ subscribers, for example--the social media post announcing the feat said that Shadows "surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey." Meanwhile, Christopher Dring of GamesIndustry.biz has reported that <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1903885728821674283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shadows is "comfortably ahead"</a> of Monster Hunter Wilds for biggest physical release in the UK this year.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🔥 2 MILLION PLAYERS! 🔥<br>We’re thrilled to celebrate this incredible milestone! <br>Assassin's Creed Shadows has now surpassed the launches of AC Origins and Odyssey.

This breaks the all-time concurrent record for a single Assassin's Creed game, which according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/franchise/Assassin%27s+Creed/?sort=peak_desc" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB's data</a> was previously held by Assassin's Creed Odyssey's 62,000 users when it launched in 2018.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has found itself in dire straits in recent months, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/">company stock sinking to its worst figure in a decade</a> after the underwhelming launch of Star Wars Outlaws last summer. Rumors have swirled regarding a sale of both the company and its individual franchises, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/">Microsoft, and EA</a> said to be in the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest in Ubisoft's popular historical-fiction series, Assassin's Creed Shadows follows the samurai Yasuke and ninja Assassin Naoe as they battle the Templar Order in 16th-century Japan. Players can switch between the two Assassins and their unique playing styles to complete missions, with swords, daggers, naginata, and more weapons at their disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
