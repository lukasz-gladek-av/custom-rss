                <p>During<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450"> Destiny 2</a>'s The Edge of Fate main story quest, you'll often find red chests around the new planet of Kepler that require in-depth knowledge of an unfamiliar language. This unfamiliar language is the Aeonian people's mother tongue, and during the early stages of being on their planet, you won't have any idea what they're saying. Your new friend Lodi has a basic understanding of their language, but there are location-specific abilities that you can unlock in order to further bond with them as well as open these chests.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532623" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532623"></a><figcaption>A locked chest needing the Rosetta upgraded.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532623-image.png"></figure><p>As you progress through The Edge of Fate's campaign missions, you'll be asked to <strong>meet with the Dean, Rebecca</strong>. She will send you on a short quest to take down a few enemies and gather some information. At the end of this task, you'll be rewarded with the <strong>Rosetta equipment</strong>. The Rosetta allows you to understand the Aeonian language on a surface level, as well as open the chests that were previously inaccessible.</p><p>As you progress further through the campaign you can complete some missions in any order you choose. To maximize the amount of these chests you can open, we recommend focusing on any missions that reward <strong>Rosetta upgrades</strong>. The more you upgrade the Rosetta, the more Aeonian language you can speak and understand, and the more secrets on Kepler you can uncover.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532624-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532624" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532624-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532624"></a><figcaption>A chest which can be opened after acquiring the Rosetta.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4532624-image%281%29.png"></figure><p>As you're adventuring through the new location, you might notice the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-kepler-destination-has-a-limited-time-activity-thatll-give-you-new-exotics/1100-6532892/" data-ref-id="1100-6532892">new time-limited activity</a>, or you may even manage to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">sequence break the game</a>--but don't worry, Bungie says that's intentional.</p>
