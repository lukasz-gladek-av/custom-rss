                <p dir="ltr">Season 4 is live in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>, bringing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/">new battle pass</a> and plenty of content to Call of Duty. Not all of the seasonal content has arrived yet, but dataminers are already showing off new bundles planned for the in-game shop, including this upcoming weapon blueprint with a must-see weapon inspection.</p><p dir="ltr">As leaked by <a href="https://x.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150" rel="nofollow ">Thund3r</a>, the "Combo Bash" Mastercraft weapon blueprint for Season 4's new FFAR1 assault rifle has a highly detailed weapon-inspection animation. The Combo Bash blueprint can be seen in the post below, which reveals a colorful, cel-shaded variant of the FFAR1 with an entire arcade fight scene taking place during the weapon inspection.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A whole ass fight scene with this new Mastercraft ðŸ”¥ <br>This is the Combo Bash Mastercraft blueprint and inspection for the FFAR 1 <a href="https://t.co/OScxzgJqMN" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/OScxzgJqMN</a></p>  â€” Thund3r (@thund3rCOD) <a href="https://twitter.com/thund3rCOD/status/1928208792518267150?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Call of Duty has featured such a wild and detailed weapon inspection, but these over-the-top animations are usually reserved for the weapon blueprints found in Call of Duty Mobile. One of the most notable gun animations from the mobile version is a mythic weapon blueprint with a gun inspection that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-mobile-weapon-inspection-is-an-entire-ww2-cinematic-experience/1100-6522802/">includes an entire WW2 cinematic experience</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to score Black Ops 6's Combo Bash weapon blueprint will need to wait until Season 4's "Tracer Pack: Arcade Champ Mastercraft" bundle hits the shop. Activision has not released the date or price for the pack, but this is part of an arcade-themed bundle with an operator skin for Toro as well as additional cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4's battle pass adds the new FFAR1 assault rifle and LC10 submachine gun, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/">more weapons will arrive in Season 4 Reloaded</a>.
