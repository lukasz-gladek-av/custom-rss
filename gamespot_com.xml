                <p>“Come on now, if we all pull together, we can lift up the weight of the world from your shoulders.”</p><p dir="ltr">This is a line from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ1N6aaKWiw&amp;pp=ygUZZnJhbmsgdHVybmVyIGdsb3Jpb3VzIHlvddIHCQnNCQGHKiGM7w%3D%3D" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the song "Glorious You"</a> by one of my favorite musical artists, Frank Turner, and it’s a lyric that constantly comes to mind as I play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach.</a></p><p dir="ltr">For those who haven’t played either of the games, you are, regardless, likely already familiar with the series' core concept: You play as a porter who delivers packages between outposts in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Ahead of the first entry's launch in 2019, game director Hideo Kojima stated that Death Stranding was to kickstart a new “Strand” genre. “By incorporating the concept of connection(strand), it's [a] totally brand-new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system),” tweeted Kojima earlier that summer.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">As I'm getting similar questions so I shall re-post. DS is not a stealth game. Could move subjectively but not a FPS shooting game either. By incorporating with the concept of connection(strand), it's totally brand new genre called action game/strand game(social strand system). <a href="https://t.co/1KaQUVH9zL" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/1KaQUVH9zL</a></p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1136074622711975936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2019</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">What that nonsense translates to in terms of gameplay is actually something quite unique. In order to help quickly and safely deliver all of your packages, you can fabricate a variety of tools and infrastructure: something as simple as a climbing anchor to swiftly rappel down the side of a cliff face, or something as extravagant as a long stretch of road between two outposts.</p><p dir="ltr">As you advance through the world and story, your constructs begin to seep into other players' experiences, aiding them as they progress through their own games. At the same time, the structures others build transform your world, too. You might approach a perilous edge and a climbing anchor is already there, having been placed by another player in their own game world. You could bring a slew of resources to a road-constructing terminal, only to find that you don’t need as many supplies as you thought you did because other players have already contributed a nice chunk of the required materials.</p><p dir="ltr">Not only does this save you a ton of time and help you get a leg up on your deliveries, but it incentivizes you into also paying into the system, knowing that when, for example, you place a zipline to rapidly descend down a mountain, that very same zipline will likely appear in another player’s game, ready for them to use.</p><p>The first game already expanded the tools and infrastructure on offer with the release of its Director’s Cut, which meant, of course, that Death Stranding 2 needed to develop those systems even further. However, this has resulted in numerous players feeling that the sequel is lacking a lot of the “friction” that made Death Stranding what it is. Some feel that, whereas the first game had a nice balance of systems in place to help you along the way, Death Stranding 2 literally paves over its cracks with too many apparatuses that overtly streamline the process of making deliveries.</p><p dir="ltr">I don’t disagree with this analysis. In Death Stranding, I absolutely was transporting--more often than not by foot--far fewer packages and materials, and had fewer options for helpful tools and infrastructure. In On The Beach, I’ve pretty much just driven around in my truck that not only can store a lot more stuff than my backpack can carry, but also protects said stuff from the environmental hazards and Timefall, the name for rain and snow in the game that rapidly degrades whatever it touches. And yes, that truck is battery powered, leading to <em>some </em>tension if I’m unable to locate a charging station while out and about. But fortunately, I’m usually never too far from a charging pole someone else has constructed.</p><p dir="ltr">The game tries to add some friction back into the experience with heightened dangers. You are more frequently asked to face off against enemies who now also have more tools and infrastructure of their own to confront you with, and the environment itself has become deadlier, with natural disasters like flooding and landslides. However, it still feels as if the additions to and changes from the first game greatly favor the player in the second.</p><p dir="ltr">But as the saying goes: more money, more problems. Just substitute chiral chrystals for dollar bills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533732"></a><figcaption>The road more travelled.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533732-ds2_sop2024_screenshot011.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the original Death Stranding, every task seemed monumental, especially as the game progressed and deliveries started to require you to transport a package within a limited time frame or without crossing over a certain damage threshold. The “strand” aspect of the game, in which you help other players and in turn they help you, became far less of a priority. When I placed a ladder down somewhere, it was because <em>I</em> needed a ladder there--and if that helped someone else out, great. I’d contribute to the creation of certain roads because I needed the last leg of my journey to go as smoothly as possible. If my actions helped complete a larger section of highway, fantastic, but that wasn't my objective.</p><p dir="ltr">In On The Beach, however, because I have so much potential to move more materials with greater ease, I’m finding myself compelled to complete the game’s highway and monorail systems for the sake of completing them. I’m finding myself more strategically deciding where to place a shelter in the wild that provides the most optimal point in the region to take a breather not only for myself and to mitigate any immediate "friction," but for every other player who might have that shelter pop into their game.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this was seemingly on the mind of the developers at Kojima Productions during production of the game, as Death Stranding 2 has an entirely new branch of side missions known as Aid Requests. While these include the familiar side cargo deliveries and pickup requests of the first game, they also include asks such as building a specific kind of infrastructure or placing a certain kind of tool in a particular location. The game doesn’t just want you to do deliveries; it wants you to fix the world. And in this there’s a new kind of friction to be found--one that takes the micro decision making of the first game and blows it up to a macro scale.</p><p dir="ltr">“I know you’ve been working, as hard as you can. To preempt the question, the expectation, and I understand.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4533738"></a><figcaption>Every little bit helps.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1773/17736682/4533738-gqampufweaaxjkd.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This overarching mission further incentivizes you to make additional deliveries, as doing so improves your standing with the various recipients, who will in turn allow you to take greater amounts of materials from their supplies. The game's new mining facilities and monorail tracks, which allow you to fabricate a large amount of materials and then deliver them via rail, also contribute this new goal, as they give you the ability to multitask and more quickly generate the means to help others.</p><p dir="ltr">But these stakes and transporting larger quantities of deliveries and materials come with inherent dangers too, as you are placing all your proverbial eggs in one basket. The terrain featured in the game feels even more dynamic than that of the first, requiring you to smartly navigate its, at points, treacherous paths. I have, on more than one occasion, been so reckless while trying to get somewhere quickly that my truck sustained enough bumps to severely damage my cargo, or in some cases, completely destroy it.</p><p dir="ltr">And when I <em>do</em> lose those materials, the sting is even greater, because now, I’ve not only let myself down, but myriad other players as well. It’s a feeling that resonates even harder thanks to the times we live in, where the institutions meant to help and protect us are either weaponized against us or being stripped for parts. It’s clear to me that the only path to a brighter future is one forged by individuals coming together to protect their loved ones and having empathy for complete strangers who are just trying to do the same. Death Stranding 2 brings that mission front and center, and when I fail it, I can’t help but be reminded of what happens if we fail in the same way in our own lives where, to me, failure is not an option.</p><p dir="ltr">“So don’t you worry. All things must end. There are sunlit uplands around the riverbend.”</p><p dir="ltr">While I agree that there might be less asked of the player in each individual delivery, I personally appreciate how the game has expanded on the foundation of the first Death Stranding. It pushes its various systems in appropriate directions that feel like a natural progression, placing additional emphasis and importance on its collaborative gameplay. I imagine that expansion felt like an expectation to the game’s development team, but I wonder if they expected that direction to stir up such feelings. Given Kojima’s track record of prescience regarding societal progression and understanding of the human condition, striking that chord of emotion was likely also a natural side effect of this destined gameplay evolution. In the narrative, even more responsibility to save the world is placed on the shoulders of its protagonist, which is then mirrored in the literal placement of even more objects on Sam’s back. But Death Stranding 2 makes it clear that if we all pull together, that weight can be lifted.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King is celebrating its five-year anniversary today, July 17, 2025. Below, we examine the ways the Paper Mario series has changed over the years, and how Origami King tried to recapture its early magic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Though Mario's platforming adventures are universally adored, the Paper Mario series has a much more mixed reputation. Its first two installments, Paper Mario for the Nintendo 64 and its GameCube sequel, The Thousand-Year Door, are widely regarded as Mario's finest role-playing outings, enchanting players with their imaginative storybook worlds and irreverent humor. As the series progressed, however, it gradually deviated from its RPG roots, shedding many of the elements that had made the first two games so beloved. While the series has never quite been the same since, its Switch installment, Paper Mario: The Origami King, is the only one that has come close to matching the heights of the original titles.</p><p dir="ltr">Paper Mario's identity crisis can be traced all the way back to 2007's Super Paper Mario. Originally announced for the Nintendo GameCube, this particular entry effectively began life as an offshoot of an offshoot--one last hurrah for the aging purple console spun out of repurposed assets and ideas from The Thousand-Year Door. By that point, however, GameCube sales had flatlined and a new generation was on the horizon, prompting Nintendo to move the title to the Wii, where it became many new players' introduction to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">As its moniker suggested, Super Paper Mario took a considerably different approach than its predecessors. Whereas previous games were turn-based RPGs with some platforming elements sprinkled in, Super Paper Mario inverted this formula; this entry was predominantly a platformer with some light RPG elements. Mario and company could still gain experience points for defeating enemies, which in turn increased their health, strength, and other attributes. But environments were largely laid out as side-scrolling stages, and the strategic, turn-based battle system of old Paper Mario games was gone; instead, players defeated foes by stomping on them in real time, a la the classic Super Mario Bros. games.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a stark departure from previous titles, though ultimately still an enjoyable one. Taken on its own, Super Paper Mario was a charming romp that retained the series' signature humor while contorting its gameplay in interesting ways. But it also signaled a shift in direction for the franchise, one that downplayed its role-playing qualities in favor of simpler stories and more immediate gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">This was borne out in the next installment, Paper Mario: Sticker Star for the 3DS. Although the game brought back turn-based combat, it removed party members entirely; this time, Mario faced off against foes solo, which completely changed the dynamic of battles. Moreover, many of the series' hallmark RPG elements were either streamlined or excised. Coins effectively doubled as currency and experience, while badges and Flower Points were replaced with stickers that were consumed upon use. It was a novel attempt at deconstructing RPG mechanics, but it further strayed from the elements that endeared the series to so many in the first place, and it would be largely dismissed by fans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4533665"></a><figcaption>Yes you are, little fella.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4533665-switch_papermariotheorigamiking_screen_13.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Part of this displeasure also owes to the game's unconventional structure. In an effort to tailor the adventure for a handheld system, Sticker Star divided up the interconnected world of previous Paper Mario games into a series of compact "levels," which were laid out across a world map like a traditional Mario platformer. These were generally roomier and more puzzle-oriented than the platforming stages of Super Paper Mario, but they made the world feel less convincing. Early Paper Mario games were so memorable because they whisked players through whimsical locales populated by unusual characters, which imbued each area with a distinct sense of place--something that Sticker Star's disjointed levels could never achieve.</p><p dir="ltr">Sticker Star's eventual followup, Paper Mario: Color Splash for the Wii U, refined some of its more divisive elements, making for an overall stronger game that was better received by fans. But it also retained a few of its predecessor's controversial qualities, namely its level-based structure and resource-centric battle system. The game was ultimately a step in the right direction, but it was nonetheless a vastly different experience from the series' earliest titles, which reinforced the perception that Paper Mario had changed permanently.</p><p dir="ltr">It's for these reasons that many fans greeted the announcement of Paper Mario: The Origami King with a mix of excitement and trepidation. As promising as the game initially appeared to be, the question of whether it would return to the series' roots or continue the divisive experiments of more recent Paper Mario games loomed over every marketing beat. The end result ultimately falls somewhere in the middle. While The Origami King still follows the action-adventure direction of its immediate predecessors, it also channels the spirit of earlier games with its vast setting and quirky cast, making it the series' best installment in over a decade--and a promising sign for Paper Mario's future.</p><p dir="ltr">This shift is immediately obvious in the game world. The Origami King eschews the level-based structure of Sticker Star and Color Splash for a large, interconnected setting--one that's much closer in scale and imagination to the first two Paper Mario games. Amid his travels, Mario visits a range of stunning and memorable environments, from the brilliant, red-and-orange papercraft foliage of Autumn Mountain to the opulent Shroom City--a gaudy oasis shining in the middle of a sprawling desert. Each area of the world is richly detailed and home to some hilarious denizens, which makes them feel much more like proper locales than the discrete stages of Sticker Star and Color Splash.</p><p dir="ltr">Crucially, Mario is also no longer traveling alone. The Origami King pairs the plumber up with a rotating cast of partner characters. While none of these companions quite match up to the beloved party members of the series' earliest titles (and are much more limited in battle), they add color to the world and a heartfelt touch to the story. The adorable Origami sprite Olivia is one of the series' more charming companions, playing a pivotal role in both combat and in moving the plot forward. Mario is also joined by several other characters at different points in the adventure, including an excitable Toad archeologist and even longtime nemesis Bowser, who spends much of the game helplessly folded up like a greeting card.</p><p dir="ltr">But most notable is Bobby, an amnesic Bob-omb who joins you during the game's second major chapter. Despite his nondescript appearance (unlike Bombette and Captain Bobbery from earlier titles, Bobby is just a standard-issue Bob-omb minion, albeit one curiously missing his fuse), Bobby quickly becomes one of the most memorable companions in the entire series thanks to his poignant character arc, which culminates in a genuinely shocking and moving scene. It's unexpected territory for a game about paper characters and office stationery to explore, which makes it all the more impactful.</p><p dir="ltr">The battle system, too, has once again been reimagined, and for the better. Moving away from the resource management of its two predecessors, The Origami King introduces a new panel-sliding system, which challenges players to rotate sections of the battle arena against a time limit and line up enemies for optimal damage. This makes every encounter feel like a rapid-fire micro-puzzle, and outside of the original turn-based battle system undergirding the first two Paper Mario games, it's the most thrilling battle system the series has yet devised.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain aspects of The Origami King still fall short of the series' best, but it's thanks to these elements that the game comes closer to recapturing Paper Mario's early magic than other recent installments. It remains to be seen if the series' next eventual title will follow in Origami King's footsteps or take inspiration from The Thousand-Year Door, which was also released on the Switch, in a lavishly remade form, in 2024. Whatever the future may hold, Paper Mario is in better shape than it's been in many years.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before Tony Hawk's Pro Skater shredded on to the video game scene in 1999, the man himself "had given up" on making a skateboarding game. Hawk revealed in a new interview that talks with various developers and console manufacturers about the concept were going nowhere in the mid- to late 1990s.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/07/17/tony-hawk-thps-3-4-remake-olympics/85205239007/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USA Today</a>, Hawk talked about how "it was kind of an uphill battle convincing anyone" to create a skateboarding game. He cited growing up on the medium as a reason for pursuing the idea, noting the Intellivision was the first console he owned. Later, Hawk had a Commodore 64, SNES, and then a PlayStation, and he also briefly did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bTcDO0Ab2A" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">video-editing work for the TurboGrafx 16</a> in the early '90s. But with multiple companies passing on his idea, Hawk noted in 1997 that he basically had thrown in the towel.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Activision, however, was working on a skateboarding game and reportedly heard about Hawk's desire to make such a title. "And so I went to Activision," said Hawk. "I saw a very early build of what became THPS (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater), and immediately, I knew this was the game. I could tell instinctively that this would be the most fun, that this would be the best one to be involved with, and with my connections and resources and experience, we could make this something truly authentic."</p><p dir="ltr">The pairing ultimately led to one of the most beloved video game franchises of all time--one that just saw the remake launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/1900-6418379/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. The series has spanned over two decades and a dozen games, with Hawk admitting that THPS games are what fans want to talk about when he meets them in public.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Hawk, he usually plays as himself in the games, though he does test out other skaters to check out their tricks. If he had to choose someone other than himself, "then I'm playing my son Riley," Hawk said.</p><p>Hawk is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-is-auctioning-his-gear-and-board-he-used-when-he-did-an-iconic-trick/1100-6532828/">auctioning off his skateboard that he rode for the first-ever officially recorded 900</a> performed, which happened in 1999--the same year the THPS franchise began. You can also see how Hawk has changed over the years in video game form with GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-comparing-all-original-skaters-to-their-2000s-versions/2900-6761/#1">comparison of the skaters in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> from the original games. But it's just not visual upgrades, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-has-a-whole-bunch-of-extra-levels-that-are-easy-to-miss/1100-6533117/">there are new levels to skate</a> as well.</p>
