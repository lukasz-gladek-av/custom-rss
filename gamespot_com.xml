                <p>Donkey Kong Bananza is now available, and it appears to be a hit for the Nintendo Switch 2. But longtime fans of other Nintendo platformers like Mario Odyssey may have noticed that something feels ... a little off? Out of place? You can't quite put your finger on it, but something is wrong <em>when you put your fingers on it</em>. It's the jump button.</p><p>For DK Bananza, the jump button has been uncharacteristically mapped to the A button by default on the Switch 2, as opposed to the more traditional B button. This is mainly so that the face buttons map to the directions DK punches: X button for upward, Y button for forward, B button for downward. It makes enough sense. But going back to the days of the Super Nintendo, the jump button has almost always been on the bottom of the "diamond" shape of face buttons. So if you just want jumping to feel normal again, there is a way to do that.</p><p>From the start menu, go to the fourth menu in a row--Options, with a gear icon--and scroll down to the "DK's Action Buttons" submenu. There you have the option to switch the B/A functions from "Punch downward / Jump" to "Jump / Punch downward." It's not full button mapping but it shows Nintendo recognized that some players might feel more at home with the traditional jump button placement. The downside is that the punch directions no longer correspond to their placements on the face buttons.</p><p>This has inspired something of a debate around the GameSpot offices, with some swearing by the default control scheme and others finding it too strange to get used to. Personal tastes will vary, so we won't tell you how to live your life. As the reviewer, I spent almost 20 hours with the default control scheme and it feels perfectly natural to me, but others say they changed the control scheme early and got used to not having the face buttons mapped directly to your punch direction.</p><p>No matter how you play it, DK Bananza is a raucous good time. "As part of the launch lineup for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo's signature substantial single-player adventures," I wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>. "But more importantly, it's an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo's best recent work."</p>

                <p>A lot of Fortnite's most memorable moments have come from the game's live events, where everybody playing is experiencing some kind of one-time-only content that you just had to be there for. The very first Fortnite live event, the one that started this whole awesome tradition, was the Blast Off event at the end of Chapter 1 Season 4--and, hey, guess what, it's coming for the end of Fortnite OG Season 4. The new version of this rocket party will go down on July 26 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET during any ongoing rounds of Fortnite OG. Check out the teaser.</p><p>The Blast Off event originally took place on June 30, 2018, when the mysterious Visitor launched a rocket that went haywire right in the middle of the battle royale matches that were going on at 10:30 AM PT that morning. The rocket took off, flew way out into space, then turned around and flew in toward toward Tilted Towers. But instead of landing, the rocket hit a rift--and that's when things got <em>really</em> interesting. You can watch the original version of the event in its entirety below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFB7k586Jm4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZFB7k586Jm4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not expected that the Fortnite OG version will be very different than it was when it first happened, but it also wouldn't be surprising if Epic threw in some new wrinkles, like a safe zone where players can watch the event without being threatened by other players.</p><p>The arrival of the Visitor on the Battle Royale island back in Chapter 1 Season 4 marked the beginning of Fortnite's story, though the plotline with the Seven--the Avengers-style group the Visitor belonged to--was largely discarded during Chapter 4. There's been some hope among folks who care about the story that the new version of the Blast Off event could contain some new detail that might tie it in with the current Fortnite plot.</p><p>Whatever the situation ends up being, the event will serve as the beginning of the end of Fortnite OG Season 4, which closes on August 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No other details about the game are known aside from its reported codename: FMC. While that doesn't seem like much, as noted by mp1st, the codename may give fans an idea of what could be coming next. The codenames for previous Dark Souls games and the more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/" data-ref-id="5000-577631">Armored Core 6</a> both featured the letter "F" as part of their internal codenames, while games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> used the codename GR. From Software's latest game, the standalone multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, used the internal codename CL.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not a lot to go on. However, based on the codenames, the report speculates that the project doesn't seem to be DLC for any existing From Software game, as the developer typically uses the same codenames in the files for DLC as in the base game. Since it's also reportedly multiplatform in nature, the codename also isn't believed to be referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/" data-ref-id="1100-6530560">The Duskbloods, From Software's multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> slated for next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the codenames for previous games, that leaves the Dark Souls and Armored Core franchises as strong contenders for the project. While it could potentially be a new entry in either series, there's also a strong chance, as noted by mp1st, that it could be a remake or remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-438502">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">From Software is certainly keeping busy, having released Armored Core 6 in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> last year, and Elden Ring: Nightreign back in May. It announced it was working on The Duskbloods in April as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">News that another From Software game is coming soon may put some fans at ease given the studio's recent pivot into multiplayer-focused games. However, From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said the studio is not abandoning single-player games</a>, and that it will continue to make games that "embrace our more traditional style."</p>
