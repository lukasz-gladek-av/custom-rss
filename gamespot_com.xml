href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-coming-in-2025-according-to-leaks-3179371/" rel="nofollow ">reported by Dexerto</a>, new Call of Duty leaks came from a Reddit post by someone named Bigbyy, who claimed they were part of a study group assembled by Activision to see what the average player might be excited about for the next Call of Duty game. The Redditor claimed the story is set in 2035 and will be a follow up to the Black Ops 2 campaign, bringing back the characters Woods and Mason. The campaign is reported to have "up to four player co-op" and an open world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the Call of Duty 2025 leaks provided by Bigbyy do align with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">original leaks from Insider Gaming</a>, and it also offers new details that suggest exciting news for Zombies fans.</p><p dir="ltr">The leaker claimed Zombies mode will have the "largest round-based map ever created," a remake of the Tranzit map from Black Ops 2, and feature a difficulty slider. As for the story details, the leaks suggest a focus on the original Zombies crew and "an exploration of the old timelines." Treyarch added Richtofen back into the Zombies storyline for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, but it's been several years since Dempsey, Nikolai, or Takeo were featured.</p><p dir="ltr">The multiplayer maps Bigbyy said were shown to the study group included many older maps from the Black Ops series, but they were ported into a new futuristic Japanese setting.</p><p dir="ltr">The post also reported that Call of Duty 2025 will continue to feature Treyarch's omnimovement in all game modes, in addition to a new wall-running mechanic. Call of Duty's "Carry Forward" program is rumored to return, which would transfer the weapons and operators from Black Ops 6 into Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">The original post from Bigbyy has since been deleted, and with this being leaked from an alleged study group, it's possible that any of this information could change prior to launch. We're probably a long way away from an official announcement from Activision, but until then, we have highlighted all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">rumors and details about Call of Duty 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, Call of Duty recently added the stoner duo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/">Jay and Silent Bob as playable operators in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>. Season 3 just brought back the OG Verdansk map, and it's been<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-just-hit-a-2025-record-on-steam-following-verdansks-return-to-warzone/1100-6530610/"> successful in driving players back to Warzone</a>.</p>

Players can simply drive into the question-box portion of the special vehicle with their kart to temporarily pilot it.</p><p dir="ltr">In GetMadz's case, that saw them driving into a large boat while exploring an ocean during the game's free-roam mode, after which it was explained that there are similar large vehicles that can be used to take out the competition on the game's land-based courses. While GetMadz got to drive the boat in free roam, they said it was also accessible during an actual race.</p><p dir="ltr">There's actually a glimpse of this in-action in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/mario-kart-world-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer-nintendo-switch-2/2300-6465858/" data-ref-id="2300-6465858">Mario Kart World's reveal trailer</a>, when Birdo drives into a semi-truck in the middle of a race and then proceeds to plow over some fellow racers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475846" data-ratio="0.56234718826406" data-width="1636" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4475846"></a><figcaption>A brief look at a truck in-action from Mario Kart World's reveal trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4475846-mariokartworldlargevehiclestruck.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear how many of these special vehicles there might be or if there will be one for each type of terrain.
