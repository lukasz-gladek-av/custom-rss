                <p>I've come to Sensei Takahashi to learn the way of the yari, but we are sitting on the edge of a cliff facing the ocean, painting sumi-e. Ghost of Yotei gives you plenty of opportunities to take a break from slaying ronin to partake in the East Asian painting style, but this is the first time it's been part of protagonist Atsu's training.</p><p dir="ltr">It makes sense, though. Sucker Punch's highly anticipated sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima tells the story of a woman warrior on a quest for revenge, and in between bouts of brutal killings, Atsu follows many of the same practices as the original game's protagonist, Jin Sakai. She meditates at hot springs, honors deities at shrines, follows animals to points of interest, and releases captive creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">But Atsu is even more connected to nature than Jin, and her affinity for the arts, coupled with her dogged, deadly determination, makes Ghost of Yotei a divine take on the power of femininity.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The warrior woman</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Astu, portrayed with impressive depth by actor Erika Ishii, is a complicated young woman. Though she is stubborn and rigid in her belief system (that the people who killed her family all those years ago must die by her hand, no matter what), there is a softness about her that she seems determined to hide from other people. When travelers come to sit by her campfire, she reflexively reaches for her katana--only when it's clear that they're someone in need, or a lover of the shamisen (Japanese string instrument), or a member of the Ainu (the indigenous people of Hokkaido), does she soften.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>That barrier is for her own protection, of course. Being a woman in 1600s Japan meant being obedient to your husband and other men. Women weren't permitted to travel alone, though working-class women were expected to work, either alongside their husbands or, if in urban areas, as hostesses at sake shops or as maids. Atsu has no husband, and she spent the majority of her life learning how to fight and roaming to earn money doing it, so any encounter with a stranger brings questions and incredulity.</span></p><p>"Like hell we will; she's a woman," a settler spits when his friend offers to pay Atsu to ride along with them for protection.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond incredulity, there's the ever-present threat of violence. A woman you meet along the way tells a story of how, for years, she hid amongst men, at one point silently sustaining a brutal branding for fear of revealing her identity. Another moment sees Atsu enter the private quarters of a samurai leader, just to find him undressed and expecting a sex worker. Later, she moves virtually unseen through a sake house because she has (reluctantly) worn a kimono. While playing a game of zeni hajiki (inspired by the Japanese children's game ohajiki), her opponent regales Atsu with a story of how a meek, demure woman came into his gambling den years ago and fleeced all the men who underestimated her. We later learn that it was Atsu's mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when it's not the center of the story or the cause of conflict, Atsu's womanhood is ever-present, like a paper-thin veil draped over the world. Will those men up the road try to attack, or offer to sell her their wares? Will this bloodthirsty despot accept the bounty she has brought him, or throw her in jail and subject her to horrors only women know?</p><p dir="ltr">Ecofeminists point to the problems that arise when we connect women to nature, just to subjugate both. At the behest of a mad leader known only as the Oni, fire-wielding Oni Raiders stalk a corner of Yotei, setting farms ablaze and destroying the landscape, black scars cutting through large swaths of the land. When a woman tries to escape their prison, those same men kill her and hang her body in front of the jail cells, a warning to any who dare resist.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu sees these people for what they are: a danger not only to her, but to any vulnerable creature or blade of grass in Yotei.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A force of nature</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu is most vulnerable around the creatures of Yotei and when she's exploring its forests, plains, and mountaintops, because she's at home there. She's safe there. It's there that she frequently stops to pull out her sumi-e tools and paint waves crashing against the bluffs, or bows in front of a small wooden sign just to be enveloped in Japanese fireflies, or plucks her shamisen while astride Shimaki, her horse.</p><p dir="ltr">She possesses a seemingly supernatural ability to connect with nature--whether it's finding and soothing runaway horses to lead them back to their owner, playfully wondering where a fox is leading her just to discover something spectacular, or summoning a wolf to her side with the strum of her shamisen. Atsu is a literal force of nature: a woman with the wind always at her back and wolves ready to be called, fangs bared, to dig into some man's flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">When Atsu relaxes at a hot spring, she'll often be joined by an animal friend or two: a massive snowy buck or a few chittering foxes. She prefers these friends to the ones who look like her. "Sometimes I wish I had people to talk to, but then people open their mouths and talk and talk and talk--and then I remember why I'm alone," Atsu says, neck deep in milky-blue water.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking to people, for Atsu, often ends with them at the end of her katana. "I don't hurt kids or animals," Atsu says. Instead, she hurts the men hurting animals, sometimes with those very same animals by her side. She is the personification of nature's rage, her sword piercing through armor like the icy wind atop Mount Yotei.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you could argue that Yotei is an extension of Tsushima's Shinto themes (an indigenous Japanese religion that believes gods are found in nature), Atsu's connection to the natural world is much deeper than Jin's. And when interwoven with the rumors swirling around Yotei that she is an onryō (a vengeful spirit refusing the afterlife until their revenge is doled out), Atsu's ties with nature grow even stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">She can summon this feminine, supernatural power to let loose an Onryō Shout, terrifying the men in front of her into submission--she pulls her arms inward, seemingly drawing in power from the air around her, before letting loose a blood-curdling scream that shakes the earth, flattens grass, and drops men to their knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu is a force of nature, and a soldier in the protection of it. Throughout Ghost of Yotei, we see her summon its power to mete out justice for men, women, children, and animals who have been mistreated by the men in power, by the people who would rather burn the land than watch it flourish. It's easy to root for her, to get sucked into playing just one more side mission where you slaughter wolf trappers or climb just one more rock face to bow at an altar resting at the mouth of the sky. She is nature's protector--a divinely dangerous woman--and we're just helping her along.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to announce an ad-based version of Xbox Cloud Gaming, according to a new report. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's sources</a> said Microsoft is now testing an ad tier for the streaming service, with employees trying it out now before it may launch publicly for everyone.</p><p>The report said the free ad-based tier for Xbox Cloud Gaming will allow players to stream "some" of the games they already own, along with select titles from the "Free Play Days" promotion that allows people to play select titles on weekends at no cost. Xbox Retro Classics titles may be included, too.</p><p>In terms of the ads themselves, the report said the current iteration has people watching two minutes of preroll ads before jumping into a game. The report also mentioned that there could be streaming limitations, including a cutoff of one-hour sessions each and up to five hours for free each month. It's possible things change before the ad-based program goes live, if it does at all.</p><p>The Xbox Cloud Gaming version with ads is said to be in the works for PC, Xbox, handheld devices, and internet browsers. Prior to this report, an industry analyst said Microsoft might look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">offering people the ability to play games for free in exchange for watching ads.</a></p><p>An ad-based tier is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-for-free-microsoft-is-experimenting-with-ad-views-for-access-to-hundreds-of-xbox-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox boss Tim Stuart first hinted at it some time ago</a>. In August this year, Xbox boss Jason Ronald teased an evolution of Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">saying on a podcast</a> that Microsoft was looking for a way to make the service "more affordable" and "accessible," and dropping the price to $0 is in line with that ambition.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">Xbox Cloud Gaming left beta and added more improvements.</a> Additionally, Microsoft announced that the highest-quality streaming, 1440p, will be locked behind the Game Pass Ultimate paywall, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">the price just went up to $30/month.</a></p><p>Back in 2012, Square Enix launched an ad-based streaming game service called Coreonline before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-kills-ad-supported-streaming-service/1100-6417195/" data-ref-id="1100-6417195">killing it off 15 months later due to a lack of uptake from players.</a></p>

                <p>So, you're bored at work, probably sitting in front of your computer scrolling nothing to look busy. (Did I just snitch on myself?) Maybe you'd rather be playing Sucker Punch Productions' new samurai fantasy sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a>, but you've got however many hours until you get home. Well, if you wanted to make the wait easier, you should definitely check out the recently released "Music from Watanabe Mode" soundtrack. It's a total vibe.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is the PlayStation 5-exclusive sequel to 2020's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Many things in Yotei are similar to Tsushima, but there are a few differences. One of them is the newly introduced Watanabe Mode, a collaboration with Samurai Champloo director Shinichirō Watanabe that features original lo-fi music created under his direction. You could only listen to these beats on your PS5 if you selected Watanabe Mode--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">one of three playable options</a> based on samurai film directors like Akira Kurosawa and Takashi Miike--but now, Sony has dropped the soundtrack on music streaming services.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_EoEz8oFso" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4_EoEz8oFso" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Released on October 3--one day after Yotei hit PS5--<a href="https://ghostofyotei.lnk.to/watanabe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "Ghost of Yotei - Music from Watanabe Mode - EP"</a> houses nearly 30 minutes of chill beats to kill (time) to. You can listen to it just about everywhere: Apple Music, Spotify, Amazon Music, Pandora, YouTube Music, and a streaming service I've never heard of called Deezer.</p><p>It's a real chill vibe. If you're familiar with Samurai Champloo and the artists Watanabe collaborated with for that legendary anime's soundtrack, then you know what to expect from this brisk but banging EP. It could fit right in with an episode of SamCham, and really brings that lowkey energy to Yotei's vengeful scenarios. It's a nice juxtaposition between the serious and the calm.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei launched on PlayStation 5 to generally favorable reviews from critics. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>, writer Richard Wakeling awarded it a 9/10, saying it "builds and improves upon its predecessor with a gripping story, rewarding exploration, and fantastic combat, with each aspect emphasizing the characteristics of a new protagonist." Now that it's finally out, we've been busting ass on a bunch of guides to make your time in 1600 Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido, Japan) easier. This includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-weapons-locations-guide/2900-7098/" data-ref-id="2900-7098">where all the weapons are</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-best-skills/2900-7091/" data-ref-id="2900-7091">the best skills to unlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ghost-of-yotei-wolf-den-locations/2900-7102/" data-ref-id="2900-7102">how to find all the wolf dens</a>, and more, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/which-ghost-of-yotei-mode-should-you-play/2300-6466416/" data-ref-id="2300-6466416">which mode you should play</a>. (You want my opinion? Play Watanabe Mode. It's perfect.)</p>
