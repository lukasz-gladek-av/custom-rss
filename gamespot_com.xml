<section><p>Donkey Kong Bananza makes Nintendo’s platforming formula louder and more chaotic.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Drop into the lagoon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, you need to chase Void Kong to the Earth's center to save the day, but maybe you just want to soak in some water-adjacent locales as you explore this new world beneath the surface. There are plenty of secrets tucked away in each level's hidden crevices. When you first hop in there is really only one thing to do: pick a direction and start smashing.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza takes Nintendo's hallmark sandbox exploration and pushes it somewhere the studio rarely goes--pure chaos. Bananza is not interested in the kind of precision platforming that defines Mario's visits to Peach's Castle, <a href="https://egmnow.com/super-mario-sunshine-is-nintendo-at-its-most-nintendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Delfino Plaza</a>, or outer space. It captures that same cheerful vibe, but lets players rip through it.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a long-running design idea at Nintendo that movement should feel good on its own. Shigeru Miyamoto once said he wanted players to enjoy moving Mario around an empty room. The reason Mario is so fun to control in Super Mario 64 is that Miyamoto and the small team behind the N64 classic spent months making sure he felt great to play, even if the only action possible was running around an empty space.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625299" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625299"></a><figcaption>Delfino Plaza from Super Mario Sunshine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625299-3744521-605064-super-mario-sunshine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combine that movement philosophy with tightly designed playgrounds and you get moments players never forget. There is nothing quite like triple hopping across the center square of Delfino Plaza, bouncing off an umbrella, and sliding into a chimney chute to grab a blue coin. It was fun just to jump around, which naturally encouraged exploration, which created a quick dopamine hit when a secret Shine Sprite appeared and the day literally got brighter.</p><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza taps into that same feeling, but in an entirely different way. I am not guiding Donkey Kong across rooftops with three perfect hops. I am plowing through debris, carving my own path, and uncovering collectible-packed caverns. It becomes easy to wander off the main objective and start exploring every crack and crevice of the planet's inner layers.</p><p dir="ltr">Platforming has always been a pillar of Nintendo design. Mario, Kirby, and Donkey Kong, along with other Nintendo icons, all focus on exploration through running, jumping, and a bit of flair. Donkey Kong Bananza keeps the flair, but adds a hefty serving of smash. It feels authentic because chaos is exactly what you expect from a rambunctious gorilla.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625302"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong is naturally destructive, according to Nintendo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4625302-img_7926.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has said before that playing as Donkey Kong should feel like an adventure through untamed spaces. Bananza producer Kenta Motokura echoed that idea in an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-1/?srsltid=AfmBOor5sKztcvT26_YMzI7y4OoXPoVNOSixNBQsaF6Qp3yvfzbIz4py">interview</a>, saying that with the goal of defining what 3D Donkey Kong should be and highlighting his strengths and new actions, the team felt the concept of destruction was the right fit.</p><p dir="ltr">In the end, Bananza succeeds because it embraces exactly what makes Donkey Kong special. It is loud, messy, and endlessly fun. The thrill is not just in reaching the core. It is in everything you smash, discover, and carve through along the way.</p>

That remains true over three years later with the Gen 2 model, which offers 40% better battery life--over 50 hours compared to 38 hours--and adds support for the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The free iOS and Android app lets you adjust audio settings and switch between over 200 custom sound profiles designed for specific games. Along with these 2.4GHz Wireless profiles, there are a handful of Bluetooth profiles, including Bass Boost and Focus, that come in handy when using the Nova 7 to listen to music.</p><p>The original Nova 7 worked with the SteelSeries GG desktop app for PC and Mac, but the mobile app is easier to use and allows you to adjust audio settings on the go. The Arctis Companion App was introduced in 2024 alongside the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0DFRX1Z35?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entry-level Nova 5 Wireless Headset</a>, and it only works with select SteelSeries audio gear.</p><p>If you own the first-generation Nova 7, upgrading probably might make sense if you take your headset with you during your daily commute or use it frequently for handheld gaming. But if Arctis Companion App integration isn't of interest to you, you'll want to stick with the original. But for everyone else, the Nova 7 Gen 2 is a terrific all-around gaming headset that remains my favorite in the $200 and under category.</p><p>SteelSeries designs the most comfortable gaming headsets on the market, and the Nova 7 is no exception. The adjustable elastic headband and lightweight, memory foam ear cushions are superb, and the sturdy steel frame holds up well. The custom 40mm neodymium audio drivers offer rich, high-fidelity sound; the audio is even more impressive and dynamic when using the custom presets created by SteelSeries. It has a retractable boom mic with AI noise reduction to block out ambient noise like keyboard and controller clicks.</p><p>Along with 2.4GHz Wireless with the included USB-C dongle, the Nova 7 supports Bluetooth and wired via a detachable 3.5mm audio cord. It also has simultaneous 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio streams, so you can stay connected and hear sound from two devices at once.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Nova 7 vs. 7P vs. 7X</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4628035"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7 (Gen 2)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4628035-steelseriesnova7.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, there are three versions of the Nova 7 Gen 2. In the past, SteelSeries has included green or blue accents on the headset to differentiate between the Xbox and PlayStation editions, but the Gen 2 looks the same across the board. The only tangible difference between the three is the dial on the right earcup. The Nova 7X and 7 have a game chatmix dial, but since the PS5 doesn't have this feature, the Nova 7P has a Sidetone dial for mic monitoring.</p><p>We typically recommend the Xbox version of SteelSeries headsets since it is the only truly universal option, but if you primarily game on PS5 and regularly chat with friends, the Nova 7P would be the better choice. All three versions support 360-degree spatial audio and Sony's Tempest 3D Audio with compatible devices.</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRPH94LH,B0FRP6CMZ5,B0FRPVTQBB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 (Universal)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPH94LH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP6CMZ5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPVTQBB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNHBVFY,B0FRPF7BPK,B0FRP537FV&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7P Gen 2 (PlayStation / PC)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNHBVFY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRPF7BPK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRP537FV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FRNR8Y11,B0FRNNXWNK,B0FRNPW7HS&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7 Gen 2 (PC / PlayStation)</a></strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNR8Y11?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNNXWNK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0FRNPW7HS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magenta</a></li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Deals</h2><p>The Nova 7 Gen 2 is the best SteelSeries gaming headset for <em>most </em>players, but it's not the highest-end model in the manufacturer's catalog.

Launched in late September for $600, the Arctis Nova Elite is far pricier than the other headsets in SteelSeries' lineup. Available in Obsidian and Sage/Gold, the Nova Elite is probably best described as a "luxury" gaming headset.</p><p>From a technical perspective, the Nova Elite is the most impressive wireless gaming headset I've tried. It supports 96kHz/24-bit high-resolution audio over 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth. The new carbon fiber drivers produce a noticeably fuller, cleaner sound, and the active noise cancellation is a step above the Nova Pro. The ANC isn't on the same level as similarly priced headphones designed for music, but it is the better at blocking out noise than any other gaming headset I've tried.</p><hr><p>The GameHub--the new name for the base station--can connect to three devices, and simultaneous audio is available for all three as well as Bluetooth. In addition to a retractable microphone, the Nova Elite has a second, stealth mic. Unlike the Nova Pro, the Elite is also compatible with the Arctis Companion App.</p><p>The Nova Elite is built almost entirely from steel and die-cast aluminum. The headband is wrapped in the same leatherette found on the improved memory foam earcups. The Elite also comes with a leatherette travel pouch with a magnetic enclosure and a zippered compartment for accessories and cables.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-mario-kart-world-bundle-holiday-deal/1100-6536599/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle Reportedly Discontinued - Save $50 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-gaming-pc-holiday-amazon-deal/1100-6536577/">ROG Xbox Ally Gaming Handheld Is On Sale For Only $489 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Mortal Kombat Cabinet Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-building-sets-optimus-prime-bumblebee-soundwave-best-deals/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Optimus Prime And Bumblebee Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>   </ul> </div>
