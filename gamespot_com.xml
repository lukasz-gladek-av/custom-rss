                <p>There's still a lot we don't know about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">the next Battlefield game</a>, but it looks like old-school destructible environments are making a comeback. Developer DICE shared an early look at the upcoming game's destructive capabilities with a brief video from a pre-alpha build in which a player brings down the side of a building. That allows the player to quickly enter the now wide-open structure.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1913249264488296827" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We’re back with another Battlefield Labs Community Update focused on destruction! Check out an early pre-alpha example of destruction that showcases the ability to destroy a wall to quickly traverse through the building.

The team's stated goal is to give players the ability to "reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage." The article notes that there will be visual and audio cues that let players know which environments can be destroyed. And while the demonstration only took down part of a building, it will be possible to "[take] down a building to take out an attacking squad."</p><p>Buildings and objects won't necessarily break immediately. Instead, they will "visually degrade" while taking persistent damage before starting to break down. Rubble from the destruction won't disappear from the battlefield, and players can even use it for cover during firefights.</p><p>For the current test, DICE is focused on how to let players differentiate between non-destructible and destructible environments. It's also examining how the destructible elements and collateral damage will affect the gameplay.</p><p>Despite players signing NDAs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">to participate in the Battlefield tests</a>, there have been a lot of leaks.

Earlier this month, Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland addressed the rumors about the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-sbmm-in-playtest/1100-6530889/" data-ref-id="1100-6530889">potential use of skill-based matchmaking</a> that likely originated from the play tests.</p><p>A previous report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-will-have-a-free-to-play-battle-royale-report/1100-6521440/" data-ref-id="1100-6521440">the next Battlefield game will arrive in October 2025</a>. However, EA has yet to formally set a release window for the upcoming title.</p>
