                <p>The breadth and depth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-canceled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">Microsoft's latest layoffs</a> continue to come into focus, as a report now claims that Call of Duty developer Raven Software and Forza Motorsport studio Turn 10 have been affected. This is in addition to the layoffs at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Sea of Thieves developer Rare</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Candy Crush studio King</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier</a>, "many" of the Xbox-owned game developers are facing layoffs due to Microsoft's broader push to cut 4% of its workforce globally. The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch. Raven also works on Call of Duty: Warzone. Turn 10 Studios, meanwhile, is known for its work on the Forza Motorsport series, the latest entry of which came out in 2023 for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>In addition to cutting staff, Microsoft has canceled Rare's Everwild and an unannounced MMORPG from ZeniMax Online Studios. The <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Perfect Dark game has been canceled, too</a>, with its developer, The Initiative, closing up shop.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer claimed in a memo to staff that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">the cuts were necessary to propel Xbox forward to a healthy future.</a> "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," Spencer said in the wake of the cuts.</p><p>"We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities," he added. "We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years. After Microsoft closed its deal to buy Activision Blizzard, it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">laid off around 1,900 people</a>. An additional <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">650+ layoffs came later.</a> In May 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">closed four studios</a> that it acquired when it bought ZeniMax, including Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Games.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>
