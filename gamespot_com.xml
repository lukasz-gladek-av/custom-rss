                <p>Earlier this year, Krafton released the life-sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">InZoi</a> in early access with the promise of free DLC throughout the year. Now, details about the second DLC have been revealed, and it's coming later this month alongside InZoi's debut on Mac.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoD3q-qOVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uoD3q-qOVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new DLC is called Island Getaway, and it was inspired by the tropical locations in Southeast Asia. It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>
