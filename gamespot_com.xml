                <p>The next Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, arrives soon on August 14. Ahead of its release, Nintendo has uploaded a new gameplay trailer revealing more details and reminding players of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">upcoming Global Jam demo</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ls_NtQ0s8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ls_NtQ0s8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This will kick off on August 9 and runs through August 10, but the catch here is that you'll need an active Switch Online membership to access it. If you're interested, the demo will be available to download later today and the sessions will take place at the following times:</p><h2>Drag x Drive Global Jam playtest times</h2><h3>August 9</h3><ul><li>3 AM - 7 AM PT / 6 AM ET - 10 AM ET</li><li>5 PM - 9 PM PT / 8 PM ET - 12 AM ET</li></ul><h3>August 10</h3><ul><li>9 AM - 1 PM PT / 12 PM ET - 4 PM ET</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the new overview trailer also provided plenty of details on how to play Drag x Drive. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are used to control each wheel on the wheelchair via mouse controls, and you can swipe forward or backward to control your momentum and direction. While a table is probably best for using these controls, Nintendo added that "most" flat surfaces--like your legs--will do just fine in a pinch. I've also tried the mouse controls on my oblivious cat as he naps on my bed next to me, and his squishy body worked surprisingly well as an impromptu mousepad while creating art in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Drag x Drive is one of two big releases for the Switch 2 in August. An upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land launches on August 28, and it'll include a brand-new expansion alongside updated graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is also out in October, and Nintendo announced a new Direct livestream for July 31. The company says there'll be "roughly 25 minutes of information" on upcoming games to expect here, so it'll be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> gets a proper release-date confirmation.</p>

That included a pair of Ho-Oh and Luiga immersive art cards, except it appears that the art for the Ho-Oh card may have actually traced over some commissioned fan art from 2021.</p><p dir="ltr">The artist behind the fan art Lanjiujiu <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950044196842459644" rel="nofollow ">shared a comparison</a> between their art and the Pokemon TCG Pocket card, with the Ho-Oh looking nearly identical between them. In turn, The Pokemon Company has released a statement acknowledging the issue.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"It has come to our attention that there was a production issue regarding the illustration of Ho-Oh featured in the immersive card artwork for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star)," the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/notice-regarding-new-illustrations" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> explains. "After internal review, we discovered that the card production team provided incorrect materials as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards. As a result, both cards have been replaced with a temporary placeholder that the team is actively working to replace with new artwork as soon as it's ready."</p><p dir="ltr">It also notes that a "broader investigation" is underway to make sure that there is no other plagiarised art in the game. The cards are still available to pull in-game, but as <a href="https://x.com/spragels/status/1950470860118380792" rel="nofollow ">shown by some users online</a>, instead of any art there is just text that reads "New Art Coming Soon."</p><p dir="ltr">Lanjiujui also <a href="https://x.com/lanjiujiu/status/1950436692789514610" rel="nofollow ">released a statement</a> earlier today following The Pokemon Company's, thanking it for its "attentiveness and swift action in removing the image."</p>

That remains to be seen, but new commentary from EA CEO Andrew Wilson suggests it may not happen.</p><p>"We're not looking to make any changes on pricing at this stage," Wilson said during an earnings call, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ceo-says-no-80-games-for-now-were-not-looking-to-make-any-changes-at-this-stage" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. The executive added that EA already offers a "fairly broad pricing scheme" across its many releases, including free-to-play, paid, and deluxe editions.</p>

<p>"Our orientation is always to capture the full spectrum of pricing so that we can serve players in the best way possible and offer them the greatest value," he said. "We'll continue to look at opportunities to deliver great value to our players through various pricing schemes over the course of time, but no dramatic changes planned yet."</p><p>During EA's previous earnings call three months ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-reacts-to-80-games-isnt-planning-to-follow-suit-yet/1100-6531352/" data-ref-id="1100-6531352">Wilson said much the same thing when asked about $80 games</a>, so his new comments are no surprise.</p><p>A European leak recently suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6533386/" data-ref-id="1100-6533386">Battlefield 6's standard edition would cost €80 ($94 USD)</a>, but EA has yet to make any official announcements. If preorders do in fact open on July 31, we should find out soon.</p><p>To date, Nintendo is the only major company to offer a new game for $80; it did so when it launched Mario Kart World earlier this year. However, players can get the game at a perceived discount through a $500 Switch 2 bundle. Microsoft was set to follow suit with $80 games later this year, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">the company backtracked and canceled those plans. </a></p><p>According to one analyst, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">consumers are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, adding that every publisher in video games that believes it can raise prices will do so over time. As mentioned, that hasn't happened yet beyond Mario Kart World, but the average selling price of new games could be above $70 when things like deluxe editions are factored in. Beyond that, games make money through microtransactions, and it's expected that Battlefield 6 will have them, too.</p><p>Not every publisher is raising prices, though, as 2K Games will launch Mafia: The Old Country in August for $50. Parent company Take-Two said this decision was made to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-reacts-to-80-games-and-explains-why-mafia-the-old-country-is-only-50/1100-6531598/" data-ref-id="1100-6531598">help the game reach as wide an audience as possible</a>, while publisher 2K said the price point reflects how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">not open world and doesn't require a huge time investment</a>. "We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," 2K said.</p>

                <p>The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) has released a statement condemning the recent crackdown on games featuring adult themes on PC storefronts, calling for "greater transparency and fairness" in the moderation of adult games. The statement comes after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">both Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/" data-ref-id="1100-6533423">Itch.io caved</a> to pressure from payment processors--themselves targeted by anti-porn lobby group Collective Shout--and abruptly delisted or deindexed a number of games with adult themes.</p><p>While IGDA stresses that it is not defending the circulation of harmful material--which many of the delisted games would certainly qualify as--it says that the current enforcement of these policies is vague and lacks transparency, leading to "delisting and deplatforming legal, consensual, and ethically developed games, especially from LGBTQ+ and marginalized creators."</p><p>"Developers report games being delisted or hidden despite prior approval or longstanding presence on these platforms," the statement says. "The lack of transparency around enforcement criteria, sudden shifts in policy, and an absence of appeal pathways leave creators with no clear path to compliance or recourse."</p><p>"Further reports suggest that recent policy changes are driven in large part by pressure from payment processors like Visa, Mastercard, and others, who may threaten to withhold payment processing services from platforms hosting adult content," IDGA continues. "As a result, financial institutions are now influencing which stories can be told and sold in games, with minimal transparency or public accountability."</p><p>IDGA is calling for clearer guidelines from both platforms and payment processors to "distinguish prohibited content from lawful adult expression," saying it's important that games as an artistic medium can tell stories about "intimacy, pleasure, trauma, or identity."</p><p>IGDA is also calling on platforms to provide clearer communication and specific reasons to affected devs, including "structured appeals and revision pathways" when a game is found to be potentially in breach. It also recommends the formation of advisory panels made up of experts and marginalized creators, as well as regular transparency reports on what enforcement actions have been taken.</p><p>"This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games," the statement concludes. IGDA's statement calls on platforms, payment processors, and games industry leaders to come together in meaningful conversation on the issue.</p><p>The organization also provides contact details for Visa and Mastercard, urging people to get in touch with the major payment processors to make their concerns around financial censorship heard--and gamers have been doing just that. Gaming communities across social media have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organized campaigns</a> to put pressure on the two payment processors, flooding both companies with calls and emails registering their concern about censorship on gaming platforms.</p>

                <p>A big new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> is here, bringing with it several smaller but likely welcome tweaks, alongside a change sought after by many. In the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/~/how-to-update-mario-kart-world" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for version 1.2.0 of the game, which is available to download now, Nintendo noted that it has "increased the frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in 'VS Race' and wireless races." This has been a point of frustration for players, as many prefer to do a standard three-lap race as opposed to the new game's intermission races.</p><p dir="ltr">An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-latest-mario-kart-world-patch-is-driving-players-up-a-wall-in-a-bad-way/1100-6532749/">update last month</a> even made it harder to do three-lap races, so this tweak to make them more common again will probably go down well (as long as the likelihood of getting three-lap races has received a significant boost, anyway). In terms of other notable changes, while playing in free roam, when you manage to get all of the P Switches, ? Panels, and Peach Medallions, the "colors of the various numbers will now change." NPCs are also weaker in every mode apart from Battle, and those of you who rely on Triple Dash Mushrooms in a low position will be disappointed to know that the chance of getting that item has been decreased.</p>
