                <p>At the end of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar fired over 30 employees</a> at Rockstar North in the United Kingdom and contended that they were let go over "gross misconduct." The Grand Theft Auto developer has since been accused of union busting, since many of the fired devs were either members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain or organizing for it. Now, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Keir Starmer, and a member of Parliament, are keeping up the pressure on Rockstar.</p><p>"It's a deeply concerning case," said Starmer. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p><p>The case was brought up by Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP, Chris Murray, who met with Rockstar on behalf of the workers. Murray noted that Rockstar initially refused to meet with him unless an NDA was signed, but the company relented following his refusal. Murray also stated that he was unconvinced by Rockstar's account of the firings.</p><p>"Rockstar fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," said Murray. "The IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar, they failed to reassure me they are following law and I share concerns about union busting ... The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p>A subsequent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar fired the devs over messages on Discord</a> about the company's revised internal Slack policies. Over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">200 Rockstar employees have demanded</a> that the fired devs be reinstated, and there have been multiple protests at Rockstar offices in support of the workers. For now, the issue remains unresolved. </p>

                <p>An absolute classic is one of two Nintendo 64 games set to join the Nintendo Classics library this month. Rayman 2: The Great Escape and Tonic Trouble, both from Ubisoft, will be available to play for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers starting December 17.</p><p>Rayman 2 was originally released in 1999 for Nintendo 64 and PC, with ports on Dreamcast, PlayStation, and other platforms following in subsequent years. It was the first 3D outing for Ubisoft's mascot and received acclaim from critics, rivaling Crash Bandicoot, Banjo-Kazooie, and even Super Mario 64.</p><p>Tonic Trouble is also an Ubisoft original, though decidedly with a lesser reputation compared to Rayman 2. Designed by Rayman creator Michel Ancel, the action-adventure game depicts a mutated Earth with a ton of colorful and quirky character designs.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAVh2BgUkxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uAVh2BgUkxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rayman-2-the-great-escape-review/1900-2545068/" data-ref-id="1900-2545068">Rayman 2: The Great Escape review</a> from 2000 rewarded the title a 9.3 score, citing its "wonderfully humorous story, excellent game mechanics, and perfection in almost all other categories." Meanwhile, Tonic Trouble <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tonic-trouble-review/1900-2543716/" data-ref-id="1900-2543716">received a 3/10 review</a> from GameSpot in 1999, with the reviewer lamenting that it will be remembered as "the game that's not Rayman 2."</p><p>If these Ubisoft additions aren't doing it for you, at least the addition of Rayman 2 bodes well for a couple of first-party Nintendo games making it onto the service. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-sleuths-think-super-smash-bros-donkey-kong-64-and-more-are-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6532987/" data-ref-id="1100-6532987">online sleuths looked at blurry cover-art images</a> from a Nintendo video and deduced that five then-unannounced additions to Nintendo Classics were coming to the service.</p><p>Two of those five titles, one being Rayman 2 and the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sci-fi-shooter-forsaken-64-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online/1100-6534439/" data-ref-id="1100-6534439"> other being Forsaken 64</a>, have made it to Nintendo Switch Online since then, with the remaining games being Glover, Donkey Kong 64, and the original Super Smash Bros. The latter two have been glaring omissions, so Rayman 2's NSO debut should give hope to those waiting for some certified bangers on the service.</p>
