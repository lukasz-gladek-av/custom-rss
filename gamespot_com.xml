                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has announced that a demo for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will become available tomorrow, January 7. On top of that, your save data can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, meaning your lengthy adventure can start early for the RPG remake.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unknown how much content is in the Dragon Quest VII Reimagined demo to check out. However, Square Enix is promising <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that players will receive Maribel's Day Off Dress as a reward in the full game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Play the free demo for DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined starting January 7th on Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam!<br>You'll be able to carry over your progress into the full game when it releases on February 5, 2026. ⚔️ <a href="https://t.co/8sN8UeyFmP" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/8sN8UeyFmP</a></p>  — DRAGON QUEST (@DragonQuest) <a href="https://twitter.com/DragonQuest/status/2008298591597850979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">This is the second month in a row that Square Enix is offering up a demo for a big-name RPG. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/surprise-you-can-start-playing-final-fantasy-7-remake-right-now-on-switch-2-and-xbox/1100-6537002/">a demo arrived for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S</a>, with that full game set to release later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest VII originally came out in 2000 for PlayStation, followed by a North American release in 2001. The RPG has been remade before with a 3DS version in 2013, so Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is the game's second time for a glow-up. This time, Square Enix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-fixes-the-originals-painful-slog/1100-6536315/">hopes to address the original's "painful" slog</a>. For instance, the director has implied that this remake wants to get players into the action much more quickly, so this demo should give us a glimpse at that aspect of Dragon Quest VII Reimagined. </p><p>Set to launch February 5, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined will be available on PC, PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and Xbox Series X|S. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-preorder-guide/1100-6534719/">Preorders are up</a> for the game, including bonuses for doing so. In addition, this year marks the 40th anniversary for the Dragon Quest franchise.</p>
