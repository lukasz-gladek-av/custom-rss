                <p>A recent rating on the ESRB website could point to a fresh release of Resident Evil 6 on modern consoles, potentially bringing the polarizing survival-action-horror game to new audiences.</p><p>As seen on the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40367/resident-evil-6/" rel="nofollow ">ratings section of the website</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/new-esrb-rating-suggests-a-classic-resident-evil-is-getting-an-xbox-series-and-ps5-re-release/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-6/" data-ref-id="5000-82753">Resident Evil 6</a> has received an "M" classification for "Xbox Series" consoles, hinting at the game possibly heading to that console. Capcom rarely does platform-exclusive releases, so if the listing is accurate, Resident Evil 6 will likely get a PS5 release as well.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1714051388" data-promo-id="30782"

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-456-coming-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6435096/">as PS4 and Xbox One versions of Resident Evil 6 were released back in 2016</a>. The re-release came with all previously released add-on content, and in 2019, a Nintendo Switch version of the game was also released.</p><p>Resident Evil 6 is seen as the black sheep of the mainline franchise, as its attempt to be both a survival-horror and a survival-action game were met with mixed reception when it was first released in 2012. An over-reliance on distracting quick-time events and poorly executed scripted events did not sit well with audiences at the time, and over a decade later, the game still isn't fondly remembered.</p><p>Fortunately, Capcom's back-to-basics approach with the next mainline Resident Evil game helped kick off a new golden age for the franchise. Resident Evil 7 is still one of the scariest games in the series, while the remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3, and 4 were praised for bringing the classic games into the modern era.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-remake-review-stranga-stranga-now-thats-a-remake/1900-6418047/">The Resident Evil 4 remake earned a rare perfect score</a> at GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-village-review-shapeshifter/1900-6417672/">and Resident Evil Village received a highly positive reception</a> upon release.</p>

                <p>Epic's battle royale game Fortnite has introduced numerous licensed characters over the years, and the latest could be the classic Fox character Hank Hill from the animated series King of the Hill.</p><p>FNBRintel was first to report about the Fortnite X King of the Hill crossover that is said to be in the works, though a partnership has not been officially announced as of yet. King of the Hill was a popular show through its run in the late '90s and 2000s, and a revival of the show is coming to Hulu as soon as this year. As such, it makes a lot of sense that Hank could come to Fortnite in a cross-promotional effort.</p><p>Hank wouldn't be the first big Fox animated character to come to Fortnite, as Peter Griffin from Family Guy--the muscly version of the character, at least--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-peter-griffin-fortnite-leak-has-fans-thrilled/1100-6519637/" data-ref-id="1100-6519637">added to Fortnite in 2023.</a> Fox's most popular animated show, The Simpsons, hasn't had a Fortnite crossover as of yet.</p><p>Hank, voiced by Mike Judge, is the main protagonist of King of the Hill, which Judge created. Hank is a big fan of <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Strickland_Propane" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">propane and propane accessories</a> and <a href="https://kingofthehill.fandom.com/wiki/Alamo_Beer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">drinking Alamo beer with his friends.</a> He's a non-combative and subdued man, so it'll be interesting to see how he plays in Fortnite, if he is indeed coming.</p><p>Fortnite's latest crossover character is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">Godzilla, who is now in the game.</a> For more, check out GameSpot's breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">everything you need to know about Godzilla in Fortnite.</a></p>

A developer at the studio has now responded to the news, thanking fans for the outpouring of support and confirming that the team still wants to make "cool sh**."</p><p>"I'll keep this short," community manager Kevin McAllister <a href="https://x.com/vikingdad278/status/1880403782976307623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>. "Thanks for the love and support everyone, especially to those that have reached out. P.S.

Sony confirmed the game cancellations in a statement to<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Bloomberg </a>recently, saying the projects were scuttled "following a recent review."</p><p>Back in 2023, Sony management said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-is-halving-the-number-of-playstation-live-service-games-that-it-aims-to-launch-by-march-2026/1100-6519039/">would only go ahead with six live-service games in the near future, down from a dozen.</a> At the time, management said it was attempting to focus on quality over quantity. Plenty of games that begin development are never seen through to release; this is part of the normal creative process.</p><p>But what was <em>not </em>normal was Sony's high-profile shutdown of the multiplayer live-service game Concord and the closure of its developer, Firewalk. Sony pulled the plug on the game just after launch, going on to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">refund all players</a>.</p><p>Bend Studio's latest release was 2019's Days Gone, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">unlikely to get a sequel.</a> In June 2024, Bend said the studio was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/still-holding-out-hope-for-days-gone-2-time-to-move-on-sony-dev-says/1100-6524585/" data-ref-id="1100-6524585">making a new IP</a>, which could have been the canceled live-service game. In the absence of a Days Gone game sequel, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-game-days-gone-moving-forward-with-movie-adaptation-report/1100-6506677/" data-ref-id="1100-6506677">Days Gone biker movie is now in development.</a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">The upcoming Dino Crisis-inspired horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-violet/">Code Violet</a>, will not be coming to PC. Its developers at TeamKill Media say the game will be a PS5 exclusive to prevent modders from modding X-rated dino-based weirdness into their game.</p><p dir="ltr">"For those asking us about a PC version of Code Violet... The reason we are not bringing it to PC is we do not want anyone modding vulgar versions of the main character as well as other characters in the game," TeamKill Media explained in <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/1880780993813987541" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent tweet</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kzTotGJJQQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3kzTotGJJQQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">But it's not just the game's characters TeamKill aims to protect--the studio said that ensuring their game's voice talent felt safe played a part in the decision, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"We hold our voice actresses and actors with high regard, as well as our artistic vision for the game and story, and reject any form of destroying that with sexual mods," TeamKill wrote. "Making a joke out of our art and possibly tarnishing the reputation of our voice actresses and actors is not worth the extra money we can make [on PC]."</p><p dir="ltr">TeamKill hasn't made any comments regarding their stance on fan art, but one can assume that any NSFW Code Violet art won't be met with enthusiasm from the game's creators.</p><p dir="ltr">Code Violet launches on PlayStation 5 sometime in July.
