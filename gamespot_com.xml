                <p>So, you've found your clients with specific preferences in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> and want to know how to cater to them? We've got you covered with our full list of Schedule 1 recipes, mixing combinations, and other tips to ensure a happy client base at all times.</p><h2 id="Schedule_I_mixing_and_recipes_guide">Schedule I mixing and recipes guide</h2><p>To start, you'll need to unlock the Mixing Station. This happens automatically when you reach the rank of Hoodlum 1, or when you begin the Mixing Mania questline. You'll need to purchase the $500 Mixing Table from Dan's Hardware, and then install it in whichever property you're currently using as your manufacturing base.</p><p>From there, you add one product with one ingredient to produce a new blend. The properties of the strain of product and the ingredients used will have an impact on the effects of the new blend. There are base products in the game, but the names of the new blends they create when added to a Mixing Table are randomized. The original items and their properties are:</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col"> </th><th scope="col">Strain</th><th scope="col">Purchase Cost</th><th scope="col">Addictiveness</th><th scope="col">Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td> </td><td>OG Kush</td><td>$30</td><td>0%</td><td>Calming</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Sour Diesel</td><td>$35</td><td>10%</td><td>Refreshing</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Green Crack</td><td>$40</td><td>34%</td><td>Energizing</td></tr><tr><td> </td><td>Grandaddy Purple</td><td>$45</td><td>0%</td><td>Sedating</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Later on, Pseudo and Coca Seeds can be unlocked to create new products with increased potency, addictiveness, and quality. Pseudo can be bought from Shirley Watts, and is combined with Acid and Phosphorus to create Crystal. Coca Seeds can be bought from Salvador Moreno, and is combined with Coca Leaves and Gasoline.</p><h2 id="All_Schedule_1_ingredients_and_effects">All Schedule 1 ingredients and effects</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478952-ss_c792894199193adc8b04cf16b2fec45c5701b0f2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478952-ss_c792894199193adc8b04cf16b2fec45c5701b0f2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478952"></a><figcaption>A fully operational base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478952-ss_c792894199193adc8b04cf16b2fec45c5701b0f2.jpg"></figure><p>When combining the base products with ingredients you can create new strains and blends. The ingredients also have an impact on the final effects of the product created. While there are only four products available immediately, the remaining ones will unlock as you progress through the ranks.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Ingredient</th><th scope="col">Effect</th><th scope="col">Purchase Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cuke</td><td>Energizing</td><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>Banana</td><td>Gingeritis</td><td>$2</td></tr><tr><td>Paracetamol</td><td>Sneaky</td><td>$3</td></tr><tr><td>Donut</td><td>Calorie-Dense</td><td>$3</td></tr><tr><td>Viagra</td><td>Tropic Thunder</td><td>$4</td></tr><tr><td>Mouthwash</td><td>Balding</td><td>$4</td></tr><tr><td>Flu Medicine</td><td>Sedating</td><td>$5</td></tr><tr><td>Gasoline</td><td>Toxic</td><td>$5</td></tr><tr><td>Energy Drink</td><td>Athletic</td><td>$6</td></tr><tr><td>Motor Oil</td><td>Slippery</td><td>$6</td></tr><tr><td>Mega Bean</td><td>Foggy</td><td>$7</td></tr><tr><td>Chili</td><td>Spicy</td><td>$7</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>Bright-Eyed</td><td>$8</td></tr><tr><td>Iodine</td><td>Jennerising</td><td>$8</td></tr><tr><td>Addy</td><td>Thought-Provoking</td><td>$9</td></tr><tr><td>Horse Semen</td><td>Long-Faced</td><td>$9</td></tr></tbody></table><p>While this list of ingredients is full at the time of writing, you may notice that mixing and recipes are more complicated than just adding the ingredient with the desired effect and hoping to get the same product. Customers can have preferences such as Electrifying, which isn't listed from any single ingredient above. Therefore, it's important to know how to achieve such results. While the full list of all combinations wouldn't possibly fit on this page, we've used the handy <a href="https://schedule1-calculator.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 calculator</a> to check these, and confirmed them in-game.</p><p>We've found the best recipes for the most revenue for cocaine, crystal, and the original plant products, so you can utilize them in-game to make money quickly.</p><h2 id="Best_Schedule_1_cocaine_recipe">Best Schedule 1 cocaine recipe</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478955-schedule-1-mp%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478955" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478955-schedule-1-mp%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478955"></a><figcaption>Unlock new ingredients by progressing through ranks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4478955-schedule-1-mp%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>You'll need to mix the basic Coca Beans, Coca Leaf, and Gasoline to get the base product.

However, the publisher also said that the Switch 2 card can also be inserted into the original Switch. Regardless of which system the card is inserted in, the correct version will launch automatically.</p><p>It's unclear whether Switch 2 Editions of game cards of other games can be inserted in the original Switch or if this is a specific case just for Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma. Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-promises-switch-versions-will-still-work-after-upgrading-to-switch-2-editions/1100-6530633/" data-ref-id="1100-6530633">already confirmed</a> that players can continue the original Switch versions of Switch Editions will still be available after upgrading.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo to ask if any first-party Switch 2 Edition games will also work on the original Switch.</p><p>There's some confusion because previously, Switch 2 Edition games were thought to just be the original Switch card plus a download code for the upgrade pack. However, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-will-have-all-content-on-their-game-cards/1100-6530768/" data-ref-id="1100-6530768">clarified that Switch 2 Edition games have the complete game and upgrades on the card</a>. Thus, the game cards shouldn't be compatible with the original Switch due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 enhancements</a>.</p><p>Rune Factory: Guardian's of Azuma's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2864560/Rune_Factory_Guardians_of_Azuma/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> states that the game takes up 20GB of storage. One possibility is that the 64GB game card has the original and Switch 2 versions of the game, as hypothetically, a single game card could hold both of them.</p><p>The Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-nintendo-switch-2-edition-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6526172/" data-ref-id="1100-6526172">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma costs $10 more than the Switch one</a>, and players can expect higher resolution, faster frame rates, and Joy-Con 2 mouse functionality for the upcoming console. The game launches on May 30 for Switch and PC, as well as June 5 for Switch 2.</p>

                <p>Every year has that one sleeper game that people can't stop talking about, and in 2025, it's Blue Prince that's dominating video game discussions. If you've been looking to try out this roguelike puzzle game for yourself on PC, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Blue+Prince+And+Get+A+Free+Game+This+Weekend&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-04-18+09%3A24%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-18+09%3A24%3A09&amp;fnarticle_id=6530963&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblue-prince&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-on-blue-prince-and-get-a-free-game-this-weekend%2F1100-6530963%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get a nice discount on it through Fanatical</a>, but you'll want to move fast. Normally $30, this brand-new game is on sale for $25.49 until April 20, 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET.</p><p>A combination of mystery, architecture, and roguelike elements, Blue Prince will appeal to anyone who has a fondness for intricate details and elegant design. The core gameplay loop sounds deceptively simple, as you'll start each day in a mansion that the protagonist is hoping to inherit by finding the elusive Room 46 inside of it, and you'll have several choices to make as you "draft" your way to the other side. The end result is a game that marries video game influences with tabletop inspiration, creating a stately experience.</p><p>"Blue Prince is one of the most memorable video game experiences I have ever had. It is at once accessible and impenetrable, frustrating and euphoric. Like each of my dozens of permutations of the Mount Holly manor house itself, it is truly one of a kind," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/blue-prince-review-an-intricate-layered-roguelike-puzzle/1900-6418355/" data-ref-id="1900-6418355">Blue Prince review</a>.</p><p>It's worth pointing out that you can score a freebie with your purchase, as Fanatical's Level Up Sale offers a free Steam key if you spend $15 or more.

                <p dir="ltr">Starting May 1, Monopoly Go players might see some characters appearing from a galaxy far, far away. That's because the mobile game is getting a Star Wars collaboration that will see Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Darth Vader meeting up with Mr. Monopoly.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced at Star Wars Celebration Japan, the Monopoly Go crossover will cover the Skywalker Saga as well as The Mandalorian. Confirmed characters coming to the game (along with the previously mentioned) include Han Solo, R2-D2, Yoda, Anakin Skywalker, and Qui-Gon Jinn. There will be a Star Wars Go sticker album to unlock as well as special tokens, shields, and emojis. The Star Wars collaboration will run through July 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiQvlMOScAw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TiQvlMOScAw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Monopoly Go was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2023s-apparent-biggest-mobile-game-launch-is-not-what-you-expect/1100-6519222/">the biggest mobile game launch of 2023</a>, according to developer Scopely. The free-to-play game reportedly brought in over $2 billion in revenue after just 10 months of availability. In addition, Scopely apparently spent $500 million on marketing and user acquisition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monopoly-go-devs-spent-more-on-marketing-than-it-cost-to-develop-the-last-of-us-2/1100-6521930/">which is more than The Last of Us Part II reportedly cost to develop</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Scopely might sound familiar, even if you don't play Monopoly Go. That's because the developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-set-to-be-acquired-by-saudi-arabias-scopely-in-3-5-billion-deal/1100-6530064/" data-ref-id="1100-6530064">acquired Pokemon Go studio Niantic last month for $3.5 billion</a>. Scopely is owned by Savvy Games Group, headquartered in Saudi Arabia.</p><p dir="ltr">Another announcement from Star Wars Celebration Japan was the official unveiling of Star Wars Starfighter, starring Ryan Gosling. Fascinatingly enough, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-ryan-gosling-star-wars-movie-has-same-name-as-this-great-ps2-game/1100-6530960/">that name is the same as a PS2 game</a> from 2001. However, the film slated to arrive in 2027 takes place after Rise of the Skywalker while the 2001 video game was set during the prequel trilogy.</p>
