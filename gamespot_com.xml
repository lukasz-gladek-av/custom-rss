                <p>CES 2025 has kicked off, and amidst all of the new tech reveals, Hyperkin has unveiled a new Xbox and PC controller that appears to borrow heavily from the design of the PlayStation DualSense controller. Dubbed the Competitor, this is a wired controller that features some premium hardware inside of it, like Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers. Official pricing and a release date have yet to be revealed, but we'll update this post with preorder links as soon as Hyperkin makes those details public.</p><p>Like the DualSense, the Competitor features a similar layout of face buttons, symmetrical analog sticks, and a familiar placement of face buttons (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ces-2025-hyperkin-unveils-dualsense-style-xbox-controller-called-the-competitor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). The D-pad is also heavily influenced by the DualSense with its transparent buttons and placement, and for extras, two additional inputs on the gamepad's rear can be found. There'll be two variants available for purchase when it launches: a regular black Competitor controller and one with white face-plates to create a two-color tone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6rko8BbWgw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/k6rko8BbWgw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the Competitor looks like a DualSense controller, it remains to be seen if it'll <em>feel</em> like one. The overall ergonomics look almost identical to its primary inspiration, but the DualSense does feature nuanced haptic feedback features that aren't present in an Xbox controller.</p><p>While it can be used on a PC as well, so can a DualSense controller. The caveat here is that accessing DualSense features in a PlayStation game ported to a PC typically requires the controller to be tethered to your PC via USB-C, whereas on a PS5 console, you can still experience these features wirelessly. Anyone looking for something with more of a retro flair can also check out a previous collaboration between Hyperkin and Xbox, as the peripherals manufacturer revived the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Controller-Windows-Anniversary-Limited-x/dp/B09FYJF6XY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iconic Duke controller for modern Xbox systems</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, NetEase Games teased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-teases-four-new-heroes-coming-to-the-game/1100-6528615/" data-ref-id="1100-6528615">the debut of the Fantastic Four</a>, the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a>. Now, the trailer for Marvel Rivals Season 1 has arrived, and it reveals that Marvel's first family of superheroes are facing an unexpected battle with the Lord of the Vampires, Count Dracula. It also appears that the FF may be among the few heroes left who can oppose him.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg2ea9O95bA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xg2ea9O95bA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, Dracula has personally taken Dr. Strange out of the picture. More alarmingly, Avengers Tower has fallen, and the familiar A logo on the side of the building has been turned into a V. Each member of the Fantastic Four is also showcased as they push back against Dracula's influence, but the FF won't have to hold back the darkness alone.</p><p>The story seems similar to Marvel's recently concluded Blood Hunt crossover, which also left the world enshrouded by darkness as vampires attempted to take over. In the game, Dracula and Doctor Doom achieved this result by disrupting the moon's orbit. New York City has already fallen, and the remaining heroes will stand "together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science."</p><p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10. And while Dracula doesn't appear to be playable, the FF will be added to the Marvel Rivals roster with more characters coming in the future.</p><p>Before the launch of Season 1, NetEase is giving away a free in-game chibi Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>. NetEase has also promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-will-have-cross-platform-progression-just-not-anytime-soon/1100-6528510/" data-ref-id="1100-6528510">cross-platform progression is in the works</a>. As part of the game's Winter Celebration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-introducing-jeff-centric-mode-and-new-skins-during-its-winter-celebration/1100-6528501/" data-ref-id="1100-6528501">Marvel Rivals added Jeff's Winter Splash Festival</a>--a 4v4 Arcade Mode. More recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-apologize-after-banning-players-for-false-cheating/1100-6528619/" data-ref-id="1100-6528619">NetEase apologized to Marvel Rivals players</a> for mistakenly banning them for cheating.</p>

                <p>Today is a big day for the WWE, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwes-monday-night-raw-is-moving-to-netflix-in-2025/1100-6520526/" data-ref-id="1100-6520526">Raw officially moves to Netflix</a> with tonight's show from Los Angeles. It also marks an end of an era for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k23-review-head-of-the-table/1900-6418048/" data-ref-id="1900-6418048">WWE 2K23</a>. As of now, 2K Games has taken down the game's servers permanently.</p><p>2K Games said it was giving WWE 2K23 its "final takedown" <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/33035089436307--WWE-2K23-SERVER-SUNSET" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">last September</a>. The game and its DLC was removed from PlayStation and Xbox's digital storefronts at the beginning of November. Now that the servers are also down, WWE 2K23 will no longer have any online functions, including player-to-player matches or even the Community Creations that allowed fan-made characters to be downloaded.</p><p>However, WWE 2K23 will still be available to play offline for anyone who purchased it prior to its removal. This game's fate foreshadows what will eventually befall its successor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/" data-ref-id="1900-6418191">WWE 2K24</a>. That game reintroduced the special referee mode and featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k24-cover-stars-new-match-types-and-release-date-revealed/1100-6520486/" data-ref-id="1100-6520486">40 Years of WrestleMania</a>, which allowed players to recreate several famous matches from "the showcase of the immortals."</p><p>2K Games hasn't officially unveiled WWE 2K25 yet, but if the game holds to the previous titles' release window, it should arrive sometime early this year. WWE superstars have also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-new-wwe-finishers-have-a-small-touch-wrestling-fans-will-appreciate/1100-6525270/" data-ref-id="1100-6525270">crossed over with Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite in the past, so the next WWE 2K game may not be the only place to find your favorite wrestlers in 2025.</p>

Notably, both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/loba-guide-apex-legends/1100-6502747/" data-ref-id="1100-6502747">Loba</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mirage-guide-apex-legends/1100-6465033/" data-ref-id="1100-6465033">Mirage</a> are getting substantial improvements to their kit--especially Loba--and changes to hop-up attachments are sure to make the already frenetic combat even faster. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/titanfall-2/" data-ref-id="5000-406168">Titanfall 2</a> fans have a reason to tune in as the EPG-1 grenade launcher from that game is joining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> through the Rift Relics in casual play.</p><p dir="ltr">Loba is definitely the biggest adjustment with this update, however, getting massive buffs to her existing kit that align with the substantial improvements enjoyed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/newcastle-guide-apex-legends/1100-6503265/" data-ref-id="1100-6503265">Newcastle</a> and Lifeline at the start of Season 23. Those changes are detailed below:</p>

      </div>
<h3 dir="ltr">Season 23 Mid-Season Loba Changes</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Loba's tactical ability (Burglar's Best Friend) is getting a second charge by default and the toss and recovery time are both increasing.</li><li dir="ltr">Loba's ultimate ability (Black Market Boutique) will be available immediately, will deploy faster, will be able to be remotely packed up, and can pick up small meds and ally banners for free.</li><li dir="ltr">Black Market Boutique will be able to steal from Explosive Holds and Vaults once again, and stealing from Vaults won't destroy the Black Market Boutique (alarms still go off)</li><li dir="ltr">Loba will be able to pick the locks on Vaults as an interaction</li></ul><p dir="ltr">In addition to these changes, Loba's in-match upgrade paths have been overhauled with one now focused on stealing more items for teammates while the other amplifies her Burglar's Best Friend tactical ability so that she behaves a bit more like a Skirmisher with escape options (akin to Wraith or Alter).</p><p dir="ltr">Mirage is also getting an update but it's not quite as major as the adjustments that Loba is getting. Mirage's passive ability, Now You See Me..., is being improved so that now the holographic trickster will always cloak while he's healing, and while cloaked after a successful revive, Mirage will get a temporary speed boost to aid in repositioning. He's also getting an interesting addition to the second stage of his in-match upgrade track, gaining a choice to access all class-based consoles, bins, beacons, and package scans to become the only character in the game that can transform into an all-rounder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592" data-ratio="0.50966936993138" data-width="1603" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422592"></a><figcaption>Mirage is transforming into Apex Legends' first jack-of-all-trades character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422592-s0_wraithmirage2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I spoke to the Apex Legends dev team about why these changes to Loba and Mirage are coming so late in Season 23--as opposed to being included in the initial seasonal patch--lead legend designer Devin McGuire told me there are "a couple different reasons."</p><p dir="ltr">"Generally we wanted to not throw all our eggs in one basket because support characters will naturally just compete for each other's spaces and some will hit the limelight and others won't. So by splitting it up, we ensure that everyone gets their time and gets to focus in on what the new hotness is. And then by the time the mid-season comes in, we can tip that up and there's something new to look forward to, there's new angles to play off of this support meta once it's been learned. The [legends] that we chose [to get updates] at the start [of Season 23] are simpler to understand legends.</p><p dir="ltr">"And then [Loba and Mirage] are the more nuanced support legends. [Loba] plays off of teleporting and looting up, which are a different way of supporting than just shielding and healing. And then Mirage, who is a very strange one, plays off of cloaking and deception in order to get off more supportive angles and options."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594" data-ratio="0.54414784394251" data-width="1461" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422594"></a><figcaption>Loba is getting huge buffs in the mid-season update, making her a substantially better thief.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422594-s5_loba3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In response to how dominant Gibraltar, Newcastle, and Lifeline have become in Apex Legends' meta in response to the Season 23 changes--all three can keep their allies up and fighting extremely easy if they're carrying a gold knockdown shield--the mid-season update is nerfing that combination a bit to give opposing legends a fighting chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"Both Lifeline and Newcastle ballooned out to a pretty crazy extreme," McGuire said. "We expected them to do that. Lifeline was already at the top of the pick rate and a revival of her amidst already being that strong is not going to bring her down by any means. So I think that these [mid-season] changes will settle them a little bit, just the way that when we made the gold knockdown change early on, it brought both of those characters a little bit closer in line. I don't think we'll see a major shift from them being super high in the meta until we tamper down on the season of support as a whole."</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the playable legends, weapons are getting several adjustments as well. The scariest adjustment is the return of the Select Fire weapon attachment, meaning the fully automatic Prowler submachine gun is once again a threat in Ranked play. The attachment is also, surprisingly, now being allowed on the Charge Rifle as well, the game's second-slowest-firing sniper rifle. With this attachment, the Charge Rifle can now go automatic, firing continuous piercing lasers at an increased fire rate (thankfully, in this mode, at 60% of normal damage).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595" data-ratio="0.56263121063681" data-width="1429" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422595"></a><figcaption>The mid-season update is making minor adjustments to both the Mastiff and Peacekeeper shotguns as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422595-s7_horizon.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese told me that the devs have wanted to add an automatic sniper rifle to Apex Legends for a while now but repeated attempts resulted in something akin to a marksmen rifle. With the Select Fire attachment returning to the loot pool, the team decided to--instead of making a new gun--try using the attachment to give an old gun the option of a faster fire rate.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's still methodical," lead battle royale designer Eric Canavese Canavese clarified when I asked how an automatic sniper rifle could possibly be fair in terms of power. "You still have some time to calibrate and think between shots. Because it represents so much power, we still needed to have a fair amount of recoil--because with snipers you really want them to be able to settle back down before you fire again. So that meant we needed to keep it a bit slower in the fire rate. It's not the same fire rate as the Rampage [light machine gun], but it's like how you would look at the relationship between a Spitfire and a Rampage. This is a slow but automatic version of a sniper."</p><p dir="ltr">The Charge Rifle's projectile size and range are also increasing (the range is going from 200m to 300) while the effects of gravity on projectiles and the recoil while firing are both decreasing, which should make it significantly easier to land shots with what's been a powerful but unwieldy weapon for several seasons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596" data-ratio="0.58733624454148" data-width="1374" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4422596"></a><figcaption>Lifeline has enjoyed a severe spike in pick rate since the start of Season 23, as developer Respawn intended.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4422596-s0_lifeline5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside the return of the Select Fire, a new Ultimate Accelerator attachment is being added to the game that automatically comes equipped with the Nemesis assault rifle, G7 Scout marksmen rifle, and C.A.R. submachine gun. This new attachment increases the rate by which you charge your shield and ultimate ability while dealing damage or knocking targets with these weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it's basically accelerating your gameplay--you're leveling up a bit faster if you're using these weapons," Canavese said. "[The Ultimate Accelerator] is all about pushing that high-octane gameplay, putting it on faster weapons to sort of align with that fast style of gameplay. It's got some cool stuff where if you have an accelerated weapon in your load-out and you get a knock, we actually reward you with a chunk of ultimate charge. It's really good if you're running one of these weapons, it's much easier to reset your ultimates after fights to get ready for the next fight."</p><p dir="ltr">Both the C.A.R. and the Nemesis have never supported hop-up attachments before, making this their first. "We're always looking to flesh out the roster in that way," Canavese said. "For the most part, the C.A.R. is sort of underperforming in the SMG category, so this is an opportunity for us to see if we can boost a weapon's relevancy by giving it utility versus just giving it raw damage. And we think that that's a really fun experiment to be trying."</p><p dir="ltr">Apex Legends Season 23 has shown considerable attention to the support class, so it remains to be seen if this mid-season update is the last major adjustment to the meta we'll see ahead of Season 24 and the next major patch. Season 24 will also mark the six-year anniversary of Apex Legends, kicking off in mid-February.</p>

                <p>A newly unsurfaced and translated interview reveals more information about how the Mario franchise's iconic pipes came to be, and there is a pretty simple explanation for it.</p><p>Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto told Game Maestro in 2000, and translated more recently by <a href="https://shmuplations.com/miyamoto2000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shmuplations</a>, that although the first Mario Bros. game established Mario as a plumber, the idea for pipes didn't come until later. Miyamoto said he was walking down the street in Kyoto one day and "saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall." This helped Miyamoto solve a design challenge, and thus the iconic warp pipe was born.</p><p>"Due to the way the screens worked, enemies that went to the bottom had to re-appear at the top of the screen. So that got us thinking, OK, we need a path or some way for them to get back up there. Then one day I happened to be walking through the streets of Kyoto, and I saw a plastic pipe sticking out of a wall," he said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-mario/marios-iconic-pipes-only-exist-because-shigeru-miyamoto-happened-to-see-a-plastic-pipe-sticking-out-of-a-wall-while-wandering-the-streets-of-kyoto/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_content=gamesradar&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Miyamoto also discussed how a logical setting for the original Mario games was an underground tunnel, in part because it's where turtles, crabs, and flies--enemies in the game--tend to live. He envisioned a place like New York with its extensive underground tunnel system, though Miyamoto hadn't ever been to New York at the time.</p><p>"I guess we should say Mario Bros. takes place in a New York-ish kind of place, really," he said.</p><p>This wasn't the last time Miyamoto discussed the origins of Mario's iconic pipes. In 2009, he said in an <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wii/nsmb/0/2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iwata Asks interview</a> that he was walking through a residential area on the way home from his office when he said an area that had "a number of drainage pipes coming out of it."</p><p>"I thought: 'I can use those!' (laughs) It's well established that something will emerge from a pipe and then go back into it," he said.</p><p>But why make the pipes green? Miyamoto said he couldn't recall the exact reason, but explained that video games at the time couldn't support all that many different colors.</p><p>"Blue was very bright and beautiful.
