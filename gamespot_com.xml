                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG has had a consistently solid player population for months, the mode has been overshadowed by both Reload and Blitz--and so it's only to be expected that Epic would try some new stuff to shake things up. This past weekend's live rocket event has seemingly ushered in the first of these changes, which could be taking the island in a new direction with the mysterious red rifts. And with this latest patch, OG got a retro matchmaking mode with no skill-based matchmaking and no bots.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">OG Duos just went Expert mode!<br>Wanna put your skills to the test? Expert mode has old school matchmaking rules where anyone and everyone could be in your lobby! Good luck ;)</p>  â€” Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>To try out this new version of OG, just select the standard OG mode (<em>not</em> Zero build), and click the group-size dropdown menu, where you'll find a new option at the bottom for Duo (Expert). And don't worry: the regular Duo mode is still available for folks who don't want to wade into this sweatfest.</p><p>While the removal of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) will be celebrated by some, the net effect of its removal is that people who just started playing Fortnite could be matched against pro gamers--which is the reason pro gamers often clamor to get rid of SBMM. This dynamic tends to be less thrilling for normal players, though, who have a better time when they're <em>not</em> constantly being matched with players who have a much higher skill level than they do.</p><p>In this case, however, the removal of SBMM and bots is actually more of a nostalgia play, because Fortnite didn't have either of those things during Chapter 1. So this sort of matchmaking change brings OG more in line mechanically with what it really was back in the day.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is easily one of the best-looking games of the year, and it looks like it's convincing enough to fool Reddit and Discord's age-checking programs. Over in the UK, new online safety rules went live and now require several platforms to verify the age of its various users there. Brits have been getting around that system using a variety of tricks, and as one Dany Sterkhov noted, pretending to be Sam Porter Bridges is a reliable way to trick the system.</p><p>Like other PlayStation first-party games, Death Stranding 2 has a robust photo mode that allows you to easily and quickly strike a pose with the game's protagonist, who is played by actor Norman Reedus. Game director Hideo Kojima used a sophisticated photography rig made up of dozens of cameras to capture every minute detail of the real-life people who provided their likeness for the game's characters, and with photo mode open in Death Stranding 2, simply pointing your smartphone at your display is enough to bypass the security systems.</p><p>What makes this even more impressive is that even if you're asked to make certain facial expressions, you can do that in Death Stranding 2's photo mode easily. As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Discord and Reddit use their own separate age verification systems, and fooling both of them was remarkably easy. Meanwhile, the UK Government is facing quite a bit of criticism over the introduction of these measures, and it refuses to repeal the Online Safety Act even in the face of petitions that have almost 400,00 people calling for it to be rolled back (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/the-uk-government-say-it-has-no-plans-to-repeal-the-online-safety-act-in-response-to-380-000-strong-and-counting-petition/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>In other Death Stranding 2 news, more interesting details were revealed about the game and player behavior. Kojima tweeted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/" data-ref-id="1100-6533497">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>--got to get those five-star SSS connections!--and that people really loved to rescue kangaroos in the post-apocalyptic outback.</p>
