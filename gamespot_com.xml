                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>

                <p>Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7RLpcD_jU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0i7RLpcD_jU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and "wannabe rocker" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.</p><p>Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.</p><p>According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, a game that's gone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">almost two decades without a sequel</a>.</p><p>Agefield High: Rock the School is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> now. Refugium Games estimates that the game will be released in 2026 Q2.</p>

                <p>EA and developer Full Circle have released a new blog post that speaks to feedback since the early access game Skate launched in September, and the developer is not shying away from owning up to some issues.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Full Circle said "a lot more" people than expected turned up to play Skate. "And with that came bugs, glitches, progression locks, and performance issues," the studio said.</p><p>As a thank-you to fans for sticking with Skate, Full Circle is giving everyone 2000 Tix and 500 SVBs. Players must log in to Skate between now and the end of Season 2 on December 2 to claim the freebies.</p><p>As for addressing Skate's ongoing issues and bugs, Full Circle said it has identified key details about the "softlock" issues that are preventing some people from progressing. "Unfortunately, each of these issues is unique and requires a different solution," the team said.</p><p>Full Circle said addressing these softlock issues is a "top priority" for the studio.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Full Circle said it recently delivered a patch that should help with issues related to daily tasks. "You should see fewer errors now," the studio said. "But there still may be a few slip ups."</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle said it continues with its effort to tune the progression and rewards system for players so that "they just feel right."</p><p>"That will mean different things to different players - new players, experienced players, casual players, and to those who skate all day. Rip Chips, Tix, and XP are part of that tuning and it's all a delicate balance. We appreciate your patience as we dial this in to make our in-game economy and reward system fun, fair, and sustainable," the developer said.</p><p>Changes to the progressions system are coming in December with Season 2. Here's a rundown of what's changing, as written by Full Circle:</p><ul><li><strong>Premium item value</strong>: We want you to feel good about what you’re spending your SVB on. So we're working to make Premium items feel even more unique and valuable, and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed.</li><li><strong>skate.Pass tiers:</strong> We're tweaking skate.Pass so it will be less of a grind to complete. You’ll also see more tiers going forward - all future Seasons will have around 90 tiers.</li><li><strong>Earning more SVB through skate.Pass:</strong> We’re increasing the amount of SVBs granted through the combined Standard and Premium tracks of the skate.Pass to 500 SVB.</li><li><strong>More branded and licensed items in skate.Pass:</strong> We’re actively working with our partners to include more branded items in future seasons. While they won’t arrive in time for Season 2, you’ll see an update as soon as we have new items to report.</li><li><strong>Event currency surplus</strong>: Having a surplus of event currency after Skate-o-Ween has been an issue, so, we’re tuning our event economy. You’ll see changes starting with the 7-Ply Maple Harvest event later this month.</li></ul><p>Finally, Full Circle said it "went a bit overboard" with Tix allotments so that some players are "overflowing" with Tix, even after using them to unlock the content they want. To address this, Full Circle said leftover Tix purchased with SVB will roll over to the next season. However, Tix acquired without spending SVB will not totally roll over; instead, only a "portion" of them will. As such, Full Circle said people should spend their Tix to avoid losing some when the next season drops.</p><p>"Let us know how this feels through early access and we'll continue to improve the way we roll over Tix from season to season," the studio said.</p><p>Overall, Full Circle said it promises to make Skate a better game over time during its early access period leading up to 1.0. "We're truly grateful for your patience as we improve, grow, and evolve skate," the studio said.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 and the battle royale game Redsec are getting a new update on November 11, featuring a number of quality-of-life updates and bug fixes. Included in the patch notes is the removal of one of the game's most infamous exploits.</p><p>Update 1.1.1.5 launches on Tuesday, November 11 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET. The biggest change may be the removal of a bug that allows players to stand on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone and ascend into the air by smashing it with a sledgehammer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Riding on top of a drone in this way</a> allows players to access unintended areas and shoot at people from places where foes wouldn't expect, and it's going away soon.</p><p>This has been an ongoing point of frustration for players, who have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1orlew2/patch_the_drone_exploit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made their concerns known for a month now</a> in places like Reddit and elsewhere.</p><p>Another major change in 1.1.1.5 is that Battlefield Studios has fixed a problem where Lock-Guided Missiles would fail to be properly countered by things like flares. Additionally, vehicles would spawn in the wrong places on Breakthrough and Conquest maps, but that should be fixed with this update. As for Redsec changes, the developer said it has fixed multiple "issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and End of Round transitions."</p><p>Battlefield 6 launched at the beginning of October and has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">more than 10 million copies so far.</a> That is a big number but it will not be enough to topple Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when it launches on November 14, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">experts have said.</a></p><p>Redsec, meanwhile, launched on October 28 as a free game supported by microtransactions. The game has a "mixed" user score on Steam, with people complaining about all kinds of things, including the lack of a solo playlist, the microtransactions, and other issues.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint to firing in ADS.</li><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would incorrectly scale with movement speed and always assume the player is moving at maximum movement speed for the stance.</li><li>Tuned landing animation to reduce excessive camera and weapon movement when aiming down sights, improving visual stability during and after landing. This update also resolves instances where the ADS aim could be displaced when sliding.</li></ul><p><strong>VEHICLES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Lock-Guided Missiles did not get countered as expected when met with enemy countermeasures such as flares.</li></ul><p><strong>GADGETS:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS &amp; MODES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where vehicles did not spawn correctly in Breakthrough and Conquest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where matches sometimes would start with all sectors and objectives active at the same time.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Strikepoint on Siege of Cairo where destruction did not reset at halftime.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue in Vehicle Customisation locked Anti-Air Vehicle presets did not display their unlock criteria as intended.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the shotgun weapon challenge “Kill 5 Enemies With a Shotgun Without Reloading” did not complete properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where progress for the “Engineer Specialist 3” Assignment did not save correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>PORTAL:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where “SpawnLoot” would not spawn Ammo or Armor.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players with community creations privileges set to Block could still access user-generated Community Experiences when the party leader hosted a match.</li></ul><p><strong>AUDIO:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where activating the BF PRO Radio Channel through the Commorose did not play any sound.</li></ul><h2><strong>Redsec 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Battle Royale (Quads) matches did not end after the last team was eliminated.</li><li>Fixed an issue where being killed immediately after a mobile respawn completed could result in the squad being eliminated instead of reviving remaining teammates.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could become stuck in a top-down view of the map after redeploying.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players retained their Second Chance after redeploying and did not transition to the End of Round screen after their next elimination.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where all squad members displayed the same highlighted stat on the Squad Placement screen.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the “Battle Royal Master Challenge 4” did not track progress correctly.</li></ul>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a> first exploded onto the scene during the pandemic. The co-op ghost-hunting and investigation game was a hit when many people were spending more time at home but still seeking social experiences, and it's continued to grow and evolve in the years since. Its latest major update adds Nell's Diner, an Americana-infused map that pairs a desolate stretch of highway out front with an eerily familiar greasy-spoon setup inside. I recently took an early tour of the diner, and I was delighted to see how it hints at the future of what is surely one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-multiplayer-horror-games/2900-7149/" data-ref-id="2900-7149">best multiplayer horror games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner, Phasmophobia art director Corey Dixon told me, is full of unique assets, many more interaction points than a typical map in the game, and several Easter eggs. Back when the game was developed by a single person, Daniel Knight, his expertise was in programming, not things like art direction, which is why today Phasmophobia still mostly uses some generic assets for things like furnishings, vehicles, and even the feared ghosts themselves. But as Phasmophobia turns a corner and heads toward its exit from 1.0, the team is looking to overhaul its visual identity. That's been the thinking behind recent map makeovers like the run-down Grafton Farmhouse or its more lavish cousin, the Bleasdale Farmhouse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_z3_9n4YtU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_z3_9n4YtU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In the future, this also means things like character models are getting a re-do and a cosmetics shop is on the way, but before any of that comes Nell's Diner, a brand-new map that looks quite unlike anything else in the game. Out front, the neon sign hazily buzzes through the fog, luring passersby who might've pulled off the road amid a tiring trip. When ghost investigators in Phasmophobia arrive on the scene, it'll be after <em>something</em> has gone on, which Dixon said is intentionally left for players to determine. A police vehicle is left out front with its lights still spinning, and indoors, some kind of ruckus has clearly occurred, with stools overturned and the kitchen left in a messy state.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like the cash register, various cooking supplies such as a mixer, a whipped cream dispenser, a functioning TV that plays a John Denver movie, and a classic-looking jukebox by the front door all give off a distinctly different feel from places like the residential Tanglewood Drive or the decrepit Sunny Meadows asylum. For one, they're all interactable; in some cases, they do one thing when players toy with them and another when a ghost does. But they're also bespoke assets chosen for the diner map. No longer is the team relying on asset packs from webshops that could turn up in other games--which, I'd add, helps Phasmophobia stand above its many copycats. It's more colorful, and because of the divide between customer and employee, it displays a few looks depending on where you are in the building.</p><p dir="ltr">Though no timeline is ready for sharing, Dixon told me the team would like to one day rework all the old maps with a similar eye to how they tackled the two farmhouses: major visual overhauls with some added focus on remapping the space when gameplay reasons call for it. They want the maps to feel lived in and genuine, not something too video gamey. In the diner, this manifests as the team including a hiding space that amounts to tucking behind a vending machine that's been pulled away from the wall for repairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The team is also giving more attention to its lore, especially now that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/" data-ref-id="1100-6532047">Phasmophobia movie is on the way</a>. Dixon told me that Kinetic Games has decided to make lore a focal point as of late.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got a backstory that we're hoping to weave into the game in subtle ways--in Easter eggs for certain ghosts, and even hints about the company the ghost hunters themselves are working for. Some of the maps may take on additional meaning and significance, too." He added that, across the whole game, there's "more going on than it seems on the surface." Some of those Easter eggs are to be discovered on the Nell's Diner map, Dixon said. "We’re sure it won’t take players long to figure out where to look, and when they do, they’ll love the surprises that are in store."</p><p dir="ltr">We played three rounds on Nell's Diner, giving me a firsthand look at things like its manager's office, multiple arcade cabinets showing off clever in-universe video games, the walk-in freezer with its persistent cold temperatures acting as a red herring ready to fool any newcomer into thinking they've found some evidence of ghost activity, and several looping opportunities, including the interior itself basically being a big loop. It features doors on either end of the customer area leading to the employees-only section out back. I asked if Nell's Diner has any secrets for players to find, and though Dixon didn't want to spoil anything so openly, he did confirm a keen eye will be rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">For players who love maps like Tanglewood and other residences, Nell's Diner offers a space similar in size but aesthetically unlike anything to date. It's a "small" map, according to the dev team's own designation, and though it's certainly a fair label compared to the game's more expansive settings, it does well to illustrate the big plans the team has for the future of Phasmophobia.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner launches soon in Phasmophobia, as part of a free update on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

It also shows one of the mission types and abilities players can expect to play in Black Ops 7's post-campaign content. Here is everything players need to know about how to unlock and play the campaign's endgame.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inK3eFlCIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/inK3eFlCIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch confirmed there are a total of 11 campaign missions, and there will be a conclusion to the story, but completion of the story unlocks a twelfth mission as "endgame content." This is designed to add replayability and post-launch story to Black Ops 7's campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame grants access to Black Ops 7's full Avalon map. This allows for open-world gameplay with up to 32 players dropping into PvE matches inspired by Modern Warfare 2's DMZ mode and Modern Warfare 3's Zombies mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame can be played solo or in a squad of up to four players. Treyarch confirmed that only one player needs to beat the campaign to earn access to the content, and they can be the party host and invite others who haven't completed the campaign yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can choose one of the main characters from the Black Ops 7 campaign or select a completely different operator to customize. Players can customize their operator in the endgame with the skills and abilities featured in the campaign, such as grappling hooks and the cloaking ability of Active Camo. There are also unique abilities featured in endgame. In the video, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discussed the endgame's Shadow Break ability, which allows the player to create an area-of-effect blast that warps nearby enemies into the sky and kills them. Players can combine the abilities with other tech and gear to create unique moments in the endgame.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924"></a><figcaption>Endgame character customization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Avalon map includes several points of interest from the Black Ops 7 campaign, as well as locations from Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and last year's Black Ops 6. The map features areas with four tiers of difficulty, and players will need to level up and progress to become powerful enough to fight through the higher-tier zones of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to extraction shooters, the endgame is designed around high-risk and high-reward missions, and players will need to survive and successfully exfiltrate from Avalon at the end of a session. If a player dies, they lose everything and will need to start over.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time Call of Duty is launching a game with full progression, as endgame allows players to level up, earn unique camos, and make battle pass progression all while playing the game's campaign content.</p><p>Treyarch's recent Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.

In order to launch in China, Blizzard has had to make some changes to the dark fantasy world of Sanctuary in order to abide by Chinese government regulations regarding the depiction of skeletons and blood.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Diablo 4 is filled to the brim with blood, gore, and bones (including an entire Necromancer class that summons skeleton armies), Blizzard had its work cut out for it. Players in China are now beginning to participate in the game's beta, in the process revealing some of the creative solutions Blizzard has come up with in order to release Diablo 4 in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">As highlighted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, blood in the Chinese version of Diablo 4 is instead depicted as a brown-orange mist that comes out of enemies when hit. For a game where massive groups of enemies explode in a cloud of red, having what looks like dust burst out from enemies instead is definitely a major difference that is noticeable from the game's opening moments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928" data-ratio="0.76640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4's Wandering Death world boss looks a bit different in China (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we don't yet know how Blizzard reimagined Necromancers' skeletal minions, one prominent skeleton enemy, the Wandering Death world boss, may offer a clue. Instead of a colossal-skeleton spirit, the Chinese version of Wandering Death is a giant collection of rocks that Western players would have a hard time guessing is even the same enemy. It remains to be seen if Blizzard has taken a similar rock approach to all skeletons in the game, but it certainly makes for a much different vibe.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some ability icons have been changed. The Rogue ability Penetrating Shot, which in the Western version of Diablo 4 uses an icon depicting an arrow passing through two skulls, is similar in the Chinese version but somehow more unsettling. Instead of skulls, the Chinese ability icon depicts two creepy masks skewered by an arrow.</p><p dir="ltr">There will no doubt be plenty other noticeable differences once the game is out in full. However, all the changes are expected to be cosmetic only, with the game playing the same as it currently does in all regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In the West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11</a> will launch on December 9, just a few days before the game's arrival in China. Season 11 will bring updates both big and small to the ARPG, including major changes to systems like Masterworking and Tempering as well as smaller quality-of-life tweaks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-will-finally-unlock-waypoints-from-the-start/1100-6536097/" data-ref-id="1100-6536097">Waypoints being unlocked from the start</a>.</p>
