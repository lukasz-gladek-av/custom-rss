                <p>In 2021, PUBG publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-developer-krafton-acquires-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds/1100-6497553/" data-ref-id="1100-6497553">Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds</a>, the studio behind the critically acclaimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/subnautica-review-a-water-wonderland/1900-6416847/" data-ref-id="1900-6416847">Subnautica</a>. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-officially-announced-with-four-player-co-op-coming-in-2025/1100-6527239/" data-ref-id="1100-6527239">Subnautica 2</a>, began development roughly a year later. But last week, Subnautica director and designer Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founder Max McGuire were reportedly forced out the company alongside CEO Ted Gill. Now, Cleveland has shared a message for fans about his ouster and where Subnautica 2 currently stands.</p><p>In an extended post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Cleveland wrote "the events of this week have been quite a shock" in addition to recapping the history of Unknown Worlds, which began with a Half-Life mod called Natural Selection. Krafton's announcement of Cleveland's departure suggested <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/subnautica-studio-leadership-gutted-by-krafton-which-outright-says-that-subnautica-2-needs-renewed-energy-and-momentum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that Subnautica 2 isn't ready for early access</a>, an assertion that the director denies.</p><p>"We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you're ready to play it," said Cleveland. "And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Kraftonâ€™s hands. And after all these years, to find that I'm no longer able to work at the company I started stings."</p><p>"Our priority is, and has always been, to make the best damned game we can for the best community in the world," added Cleveland. "With your Gorge plushies and your hand-drawn fish fan-art, and yes, your hard-earned dollars, you've supported us in every way, in every season, cold and warm, since Half-Life modding was even a thing. And I also want you to know that this is not where the story ends."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/subnautica-2-studio-begs-rioting-fans-for-benefit-of-the-doubt-after-leadership-axed-by-owner-krafton-the-team-that-has-been-working-on-the-game-day-to-day-over-the-last-few-years-remains-completely-unchanged/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, some fans have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1lqzmon/boycott_subnautica_2_remove_it_from_your_wishlist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">called for a Subnautica 2 boycott</a> and urged others to remove the game from their wish lists. That led to <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a response from Unknown Worlds</a> which asks players for patience and notes that most of Subnautica 2's developers remain with the project.</p>

Duke Nukem and Tomb Raider's Lara Croft will be getting their own personalized tanks as they headline two separate Heroes' Paths chapters from July 10 to July 21. According the launch trailer below, Lara's chapter will have 30 stages while Duke's will have 40.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wmRci2g_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2wmRci2g_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Keeley Hawes is reprising her role as Lara Croft from a handful of Tomb Raider games that were released before the 2013 reboot, as well as Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light. Although Lara isn't known for using a tank, her vehicle of choice in this game is a Tier VIII U.S. versatile medium tank that comes with a lot of Lara's archeology tools including her hatchet, ropes, cables, a winch, and more.</p><p>Jon St. John--the original and only voice of Duke Nukem--is also stepping back into his iconic role for this guest appearance. Unlike Lara, Duke riding in a tank feels very much in character. His ride is a nuclear-powered TS-6, a Tier IX U.S. assault heavy tank. Understandably, it comes with a lot of Duke's heavy ordinance including laser machine guns, grenade launchers, and other "enhanced weapons systems."</p><p>Duke and Lara's stages will include several nods to their respective histories with returning characters, cosmetics, and collectibles. A new Lara Croft theme was created for this event, while Duke Nukem's Grabbag theme will be used in his portion of the game.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Lesta Games--the Russian studio behind Mir Tankov, an offshoot of World of Tanks--was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-studio-seized-by-russia-accused-of-supporting-ukraine/1100-6532140/" data-ref-id="1100-6532140">accused by Russia of illegally funneling money from its title to Ukraine</a>. Wargaming--the studio behind World of Tanks--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">hasn't hidden its support for Ukraine</a> in the war against Russia. However, Wargaming and Lesta Games are no longer tied together, despite the allegations.</p>
