The developer states that the game has "a more stable frame rate, lower loading times, and smoother gameplay" on the PC handheld. </p><p dir="ltr">Larian detailed what's included with hotfix 34 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/511843343389426278" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a> in a set of patch notes, with the spotlight on the Steam Deck-native build. But the developer pointed out this new portable version of Baldur's Gate 3 has led to "overall improvements to the way game models are streamed on all platforms, which should reduce framerate spikes in busy areas, such as the Lower City in Act 3."
