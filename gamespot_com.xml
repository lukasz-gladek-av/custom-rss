                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is clearly off to the races if its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-having-a-massive-debut-on-steam/1100-6535370/">domination of the Steam charts</a> are any indication. Over the course of its launch weekend, EA's latest and greatest multiplayer shooter put up remarkable numbers, cresting over 740,000 concurrent players regularly. And while the game is still pretty fresh, it has impressively retained a great deal of players at all times, rarely dropping below about 200,000 active players at any given point.</p><p dir="ltr">On Steam at least, Battlefield 6 boasts the most concurrent players of any entry in the franchise, and it has ranked among Steam's most played games the entirety of the weekend. It is also the #1 top seller on Steam, which is especially prominent given the fact that the base game is going for a whopping $70. I think it's safe to say that all that momentum Battlefield 6 has been enjoying has turned it into the series' first bonafide hit in a long while.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I think this Sunday will be good in terms of how many of you all are playing BF6! New record? I hope so!</p>  — David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1977395959446286661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Despite the momentum that Battlefield 6 had going into the weekend after its launch--a holiday weekend, no less--it wasn't able to beat out its peak of 747,000+ players, which it achieved right at release on October 10. Still, Battlefield 6's early Steam numbers are good enough to beat out Call of Duty's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/" rel="nofollow ">all-time high</a> on the platform, which is currently sitting at about 492,000, as well as other major shooters on the market like Apex Legends and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6's outstanding start isn't without precedent. A slew of leaks from the Battlefield Labs program, which invited select players to test the game out early and provide meaningful feedback, detailed many features that built up anticipation. Anticipation which eventually exploded around the game's full reveal earlier this summer, where the developers at Battlefield Studios teased inspiration from Battlefield's 3 and 4 (the darlings of the franchise) as well as a back-to-basics approach after Battlefield 2042's tumultuous launch.</p><p dir="ltr">An open beta in August seemed to crystallize the fervor around Battlefield 6, drawing in more than 500,000 players on Steam alone and proving to many that the franchise was in rare form after a series of misses. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/">review-in-progress</a> confirms as much, calling it "a return to form for the long-running series, delivering chaotic, large-scale multiplayer that's as familiar as it is uproariously fun."</p><p dir="ltr">I guess all that remains to be seen now is whether Battlefield 6 can maintain this good buzz and momentum moving forward, especially as competitors like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> inch closer to release.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Xbox underwent a massive internal shift resulting in a number of projects <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#1">getting canceled</a>, a great deal of employees <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">being laid off</a>, and at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">one studio closure</a>. Among the damage done was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/">cancelation of Everwild</a>, a third-person fantasy game that underwent a turbulent development cycle before having the plug pulled on it.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time of its cancelation, we'd only ever seen two trailers of the game. Details of the project outside of these atmospheric teasers were scarce and it seemed like we would hear very little after its untimely demise. Now though, it appears that screenshots of some early builds have leaked, at last giving players some idea of the game they'll never get to play.</p><p dir="ltr">First reported by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/screenshots-rares-everwild-featuring-ui-gameplay-details" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, the screenshots come by way of an artist that once worked on the title at Rare, and reportedly resemble a version of the game close to its cancelation. In these screenshots, you can make out the game's cel-shaded art style, as well as some elements of its menu and UI, which detail some kind of farming/survival mechanics.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vazou?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Vazou</a> Capturas de Tela do Cancelado Everwild da Rare 📸<br> As imagens mostravam (provavelmente) uma versão relativamente recente, de um pouco antes do jogo ser cancelado pela Microsoft<br>A interface nos lembra um pouco dos jogos da franquia Zelda modernos , embora tenhamos sido… <a href="https://t.co/7lMlrAUvXw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7lMlrAUvXw</a></p>  — Pastor Xbox (@PastorXbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/PastorXbox/status/1977745836097315011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In a seemingly early build of Everwild, we get our first glimpse at a menu that is divided into tools, seeds, and figments. The latter two appear to be consumables of some sorts, with Figments specifically looking like deployable critters of some sort that come in various types, while the toolbar suggests items that the player might use more regularly, especially if Everwild was to support some sort of farming element. Reportedly, the game was being developed as a third-person title with God game and survival mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">Another screenshot shows a more developed and artistically rendered version of the same menu, though this time it also features tabs hinting at other items the player could use such as mosaics and plants alongside tools, figments, and seeds. One even shows a bit of flavor text for an item called a shrub seed which pokes fun at the player's intelligence.</p><p dir="ltr">Among the leaked images is one showing off a number of Everwild's settings. Interestingly, MP1st notes that according to the website where the images were found, Rare was going to use player data from Sea of Thieves, its ongoing pirate live-service game, to inform its settings for Everwild, though specific examples of this philosophy aren't mentioned.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the remaining screenshots show off some glimpses at the game's environment, though they also give away painfully little. In one image, the player seems to stand before a structure in a sea of fog while another provides a blurry glimpse at a forested area. Even if the images are of an early build, Everwild sure was nailing the naturalistic ambience of its cinematics.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I expect these screenshots will be all we get out of Everwild for a long time. Still, I'm glad we got to see it at all, and now many can finally imagine a more concrete version of this regrettably axed title.</p>

However, you’ll want to prioritize any plant that doesn’t disappear upon harvesting it before too long. Generally, they’re more cost-effective, meaning that you’ll recoup your money and won’t need to buy and plant replacement seeds.</p><p>While single-harvest plants don’t normally give a good return upon sale, there are a couple of exceptions. Bamboo is the most plentiful plant with the best resale value. Buy as many seeds as you can afford in the shop whenever they replenish, then plant them in the corner of your garden and leave them there. Expose them to as many weather effects as you can so that they can get as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/" data-ref-id="1100-6534388">Grow A Garden mutations</a> as possible, then sell them for a fortune.

Completing this set of quests will reward you with a cooking kit and 5 silver common seed packs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575747"></a><figcaption>Occasionally, you'll get a plant that has a whole bunch of different mutations, each one buffing how much it's worth when sold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575747-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-mid-game.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mid_late_game_tips_for_making_money">Mid-late game tips for making money</h2><p>Once you’ve made your first million Sheckles, it’s time to use tools such as the shovel to dig up plants that are no longer needed. Any common, uncommon, and rare plants are taking precious space that you can better use for when you find or buy higher rarity plants. If you’re unsure what the rarity of your plant is, hover your cursor or face the direction of the crop and look at the color of its name. If it’s grey, green, or blue, then you can probably dig it up.</p><p>Bulky single-harvest plants, such as watermelons, or replenishable ones like apples that don’t give a lot of profit, should be sold as soon as possible. Instead, you should grow high-yield trees such as coconuts, mangoes, dragon fruit, and romanesco. Bamboo is still a good investment at the mid-game, because they grow quickly and are worth a fair bit when affected by many mutations. Eventually, you’ll be able to afford the most expensive plants and dedicate all your garden space to growing them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575751"></a><figcaption>Some mutations, such as Inverted, give an additional boost to pet XP, while others allow pets to give bonus mutations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575751-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-pet-mutations.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Mutate_your_rarest_pets">Mutate your rarest pets</h2><p>This is also the time when you should be investing in Grow A Garden pets. Focus initially on trying to get any event-exclusive pets that grant mutations that will disappear once a new update appears. They’re not worth much now, but hatching as many of them as you can gives you potential trades in the future. Don’t bother with any common or uncommon eggs from the shop. There are very few that are worth the hassle of hatching, while rare and higher rarity eggs can be game-changing.</p><p>As for mutations, a pet can only have one at a time, so choose carefully which one you want. To mutate them, feed them to level 50 and deposit them for 500,000,000 sheckles at the facility next to the pet shop. You can also give them a Golden Acorn from level 40 to give them a random mutation from one of the following options.</p><ul><li><strong>Shiny</strong> - provides an additional 15% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Inverted</strong> - provides an additional 30% boost to the pet’s XP per second.</li><li><strong>Windy</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 20.12% chance a nearby fruit gets the Windstruck mutation.</li><li><strong>Frozen</strong> - every 4 minutes and 47 seconds, there’s a 30% chance a nearby fruit gets the Frozen mutation.</li><li><strong>Golden</strong> - gives a big increase to the pet’s passive.</li><li><strong>Mega</strong> - pet is gigantic and has a 20% faster hunger rate. Gains an additional 10-40 XP per second.</li><li><strong>Tiny</strong> - pet is tiny and has a 20% slower hunger rate.

These can help you improve your pet’s abilities, water your plants more efficiently, and even change cleansing sprays into ones that give plants mutations instead. We highly recommend you save a Basic, Advanced, and Godly sprinkler to craft either a Lightning Rod or Tanning Mirror for 500,000 Sheckles. When you deploy them, they give nearby plants a higher chance to be affected by the Shocked or Sundried mutations during thunderstorms and heatwaves, respectively.</p><p>You can also craft unusual plants by combining seeds and plants like some kind of Frankenstein’s courgette. It’s frankly absurd as a concept, but if you want access to Lingonberries, Mandrakes, and all the other craftable plants, then you’ll need to invest some time, money, and resources into getting them for your garden.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575780"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575780-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-admin-abuse.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Participate_in_Admin_Abuse_events">Participate in Admin Abuse events</h2><p>Before loading up Grow A Garden from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox main page</a>, you’ll want to pay attention to the section below that tells you when the next event will begin. This is because, in addition to briefly describing what the event entails, it also states that an “Admin Abuse” will occur starting an hour before the update is released.</p><p>Yes, the name is rather unfortunate, but what typically happens during an Admin Abuse is that one of the main creators of the game will appear via big messages on the game screen, similar to the ones that tell you when the shop restocks. They will announce things such as when rare items are being added to the relevant shops, and warn players about certain Admin-only Grow A Garden weather events.</p><p>Having lots of plants with a high resale value in your garden before the Admin Abuse begins is key to making millions of Sheckles per plant. Fill your garden with plants like Bamboo or regrowable plants such as romanesco at least a couple of hours before the new event switchover time to guarantee that you have plenty of valuable crops to sell once the update is complete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575778"></a><figcaption>Picking up a Cooking Kit will allow you to make food, which is needed for complex crafting recipes and increasing your friendship levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575778-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-cooking.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Cook_plants_in_the_cooking_kit">Cook plants in the cooking kit</h2><p>To get a cooking kit, you need to either complete the Common, Rare, or Mythical tier achievements or buy one in the cosmetic shop for 1,000,000 Sheckles. Place it in your garden and have a plant in your hand to then put it into the pot for cooking. You can only put in five plants to make food, so make sure they’re high-value or ones with mutations to increase the chances of getting a food with those same bonuses. The mutation gauge on the cooking kit will increase the more fruits with these multipliers are used in the recipe.</p><p>The advantage of this is that they are worth more friendship points when you feed them to shop owners. Regular food is worth 2 points, while mutated food is worth a lot more for every mutation. Given that there is a 24-hour cooldown before you can feed a shopkeeper again, having many mutations on one plant is vital for ensuring your friendship level increases with as few plants as possible.</p><p>Crafting specific Grow A Garden recipes, such as Corndogs, is simplified because only the type of plant is taken into account when cooking. For example, the corndog requires one plant to act as the stick, one as the meat, and one as the batter. You can use many plants as the stick part, but only a handful are acceptable meats. The batter, in this case, has to be either violet corn or corn.</p><p>You should also have a few cakes on hand, just in case there’s an NPC birthday, as giving them a slice will hand you one of the rarer items from their shop for free. Here are all the NPC birthdays:</p><ul><li><strong>Eloise (Gear shop</strong>) - March 4</li><li><strong>Sam (Seed shop)</strong> - July 2</li><li><strong>Isaac (Cosmetic shop)</strong> - December 1</li><li><strong>Raphael (Egg shop)</strong> - October 30</li><li><strong>Orson (Ascension shop)</strong> - Unknown</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4575770-grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-merchant.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575770"></a><figcaption>Some merchants will only appear once every half an hour next to the Seed Shop.

                <p>In June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a> became Remedy's first self-published game as the company attempted to expand its shared universe that includes Control and Alan Wake. Remedy has previously disclosed that Firebreak's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-but-it-still-plans-to-turn-things-around/1100-6533852/" data-ref-id="1100-6533852">sales came in below expectations</a>, but the latest report indicates that the game will cost the company a very significant write down.</p><p>Ahead of Remedy's quarterly financial report on October 29, the company <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared an update</a> that it is on the hook for a €14.9 million loss or approximately $17,234,085. Remedy notes that this amounts to "a majority of the game’s capitalized development costs," before adding that the company's cash position hasn't been changed by this setback.</p><p>Firebreak ran into trouble out of the gate with 1,992 players on launch day, which turned out to be its peak. Those numbers <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have since drastically fallen</a> to less than 100 concurrent players per day. Remedy subsequently acknowledged that players were particularly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fbc-firebreak-update-will-address-the-game-frustrating-opening-hour/1100-6533265/" data-ref-id="1100-6533265">unhappy with the first hour of the game</a> and promised to rectify its shortcomings with a future update.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFx8yMOC67w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFx8yMOC67w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Remedy rolled out the Breakpoint update at the end of September, which included a playable tutorial for new players that walks them through the basics, while adding context for the game's world, including The Oldest House from Control. The update also made significant changes to how players pick their missions. However, Remedy noted in its report that the update has not met its' "internal targets" despite earning "improved player and sales metrics."</p><p>The company is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">on Control 2</a>, in addition to the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project alongside Rockstar Games. Remedy's October 29 report may include more details about those games.</p>

                <p>The details surrounding the first pack of paid DLC for Borderlands 4 have been revealed. Dropping November 20th, this narrative-based content--called Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day--will feature all new missions, enemies and legendary gear. </p><p>Developer Gearbox Software shared these details on October 11 during a panel at PAX Australia. Apparently, Mercenary Day (think Christmas) is being threatened by the Timekeeper’s Minister of Culture. It’s up to Rush and the vault hunters to show them the error of their ways using an assortment of guns, grenades, and all manner of skill-based attacks. </p>

      </div>
<p>Aside from the loot gained from completing missions and extra collectibles (like a new Drone Skin or Vault Hunter Style), players will also gain access to a Vault Card with unlockable rewards. There will be 24 cosmetic items to collect and 4 pieces of rerollable gear that can be earned multiple times, giving players a chance to roll each weapon with the “right” stats.</p><h3>The Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card loot:</h3><ul><li>4 rerollable weapons</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Heads usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>4 Vault Hunter Skins usable by Vex, Rafa, Amon, and Harlowe</li><li>5 Weapon Skins</li><li>5 Vehicle Skins</li><li>4 ECHO-4 Drone Skins</li><li>2 ECHO-4 Attachments</li></ul><p>Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day will be available for players who purchased either of the Borderlands 4 Deluxe editions. The bounty pack can also be purchased via a bundle (which includes all 4 packs) or as a single piece of DLC.</p><p>Gearbox also mentioned Borderlands 4's free seasonal content, including a new mini-event: Horrors of Kairos. From October 23 to November 6, players will be able to face tough world bosses in areas affected by blood rain. Each one will have a chance to drop new legendary loot. If that wasn’t enough, Gearbox is also planning to release new seasonal cosmetics through the use of SHiFT codes.</p><p>Then there’s the new endgame content coming in Q4, an early highlight being a tough boss called Bloomreaper the Invincible. Confronting this boss will be akin to starting a raid-like experience--players will have to adjust their builds in order to deal with Bloomreaper’s giant health pool and powerful attacks. Basically, Borderlands fans have a lot to look forward to.</p>
