A spokesperson for the studio confirmed this to <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/baldurs-gate-3-devs-shift-full-attention-to-their-next-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, adding that Larian will be on a "media blackout" going ahead.</p><p>[Larian boss Swen Vincke] and the team['s]â€¦ full attention is focused on crafting their next title," a spokesperson said.</p><p>Vincke also recently <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1877608305452892504" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to a documentary</a> about Larian titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjRzwdKlB3s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Larian Studios: From Bankruptcy to Baldur's Gate 3."</a> The feature digs into Larian's origins and goes over the team's history as a game developer, leading up to the launch and huge success of Baldur's Gate 3.</p><p>Vincke said watching the video made him feel "all nostalgic." He added, "It really has been a incredible journey so far. But the story ain't over yet. Stay tuned. Going to try to skip the dark night of the soul moment though if you don't mind."</p><p>As for Larian's next game, the studio is working on a title codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">"Excalibur."</a> There is no word on what this game actually is, though we know it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">won't be Baldur's Gate 4.</a></p><p>Beyond Larian's next game, Vincke is thinking even further out and has grand plans to create a "very big RPG" that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-is-working-toward-an-rpg-that-dwarfs-it/1100-6522051/" data-ref-id="1100-6522051">"dwarf"</a> any of Larian's previous releases. "It's an inspirational goal. That's it. I cannot say more, because it needs to stay in that dream-reality," he said.</p><p>While Larian will not make Baldur's Gate 4, Hasbro has said it is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">keen to expand the Baldur's Gate series with other teams. </a>"We're going to take our time and find the right partner, the right approach, and the right product," Hasbro previously said about the future of Baldur's Gate.</p>
