                <p dir="ltr">Obsidian's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a> is one of the better action-RPGs released in 2025. While it doesn't reinvent any particular wheel, it benefits from an engaging campaign, fun combat systems, and charming characters. Aside from the occasional bug--a common element of Obsidian's open-world games--and an overabundance of homicidal bears, I liked nearly everything about the game. That includes Avowed's most controversial game mechanic: enemy respawns, or the lack thereof.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to RPGs, players often think of a few key elements. Some sort of leveling system, quest-granting NPCs, obtainable loot that bolsters certain "builds" or playstyles--you know, the basics. One feature that's common but maybe not as notable, considering its use in other genres, is respawning enemies. Players often expect areas to repopulate with baddies whenever they return to a given location. Avowed isn't about that life though--at least, not entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is designed to respond to your actions in meaningful ways, and not just during key moments, where certain decisions can change the direction of the game's story. This also applies to Avowed's enemies. Essentially, most of the outlaws, walking mushrooms, and crazed bears you'll run into during your journey, won't return after being killed. Laid waste to a group of Xaurips while wandering through the forest? Don't worry. They'll still be dead on return trips. Slain a few dozen Spiderlings in an underground lair? They won't be resurrected anytime soon, either. Rinse and repeat--or rather, don't repeat.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, this aspect of Avowed's gameplay didn't sit well with everyone. Some didn't like how empty areas felt after a while. Others hated that they couldn't farm enemies for experience points or random loot--a shortcoming that exacerbated the irritating grind of upgrading gear before Avowed's day-one patch. In most cases, the complaints about this feature are reasonable. That said, I liked the idea of never having to face the same enemy twice. Not having to worry about battling the same group of skeletons on return trips to their camp was great, especially during those times when I needed to collect something I missed; returning for a chest that could only be opened with a specific key (or several lock picks) was a breeze.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626294"></a><figcaption>Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626294-8719650200-ss_8a.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>I also liked how my actions had consequences. If I made a place relatively safe for travelers to explore, it stayed that way. And conversations with NPCs would reflect how I was able to put down a group of bandits that threatened their town. Again, this sort of thing is common when dealing with story-based missions or important side quests. It's easier to role-play when everything you do matters, though. Even on a small scale, it's nice to feel like you're a meaningful part of Avowed's world.</span></p><p dir="ltr">The most notable reason this novel feature is a good thing has to do with farmable enemies. There aren't any, which in turn means that grinding for XP isn't a thing. Obsidian has created multiple combat systems that, when combined, offset the need to constantly hit certain levels. Yeah, there are places that are initially off-limits to new players. And seeing multiple enemies with skulls over their heads (indicating their threat level) could mean trouble. But thanks to the ability to upgrade weapons/gear, flexible build-crafting, competent AI companions, and a generous helping of XP whenever a quest is completed, I never felt under-leveled when trying to complete a story-based mission.</p><p dir="ltr">I've played enough video games over the years to know that grinding, while being a respected method of controlling the pace of certain activities, isn't always needed. I've also gotten to a point where I can better appreciate a developer's efforts to respect my time as a player; this is less "old person yelling at the clouds" and more "I no longer have all of the time in the world to play games." That's not to say that I didn't partake in side quests, bounties, and more--just that I was never made to feel like I had to do those things to progress.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed offered me a balanced experience throughout my entire playthrough. And part of that appeal came from Obsidian's deliberate efforts to allow players to play at their own pace. You could go through the game clearing all the camps, caves, and abandoned mines in hopes of min/maxing your character. You can also, for the most part, just stick to the main questline and still have a good time. Creating a game that doesn't allow for enemy respawns--which requires changes to the normal RPG grind-fest formula--works in Avowed's favor.</p>
