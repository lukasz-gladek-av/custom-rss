                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>

                <p>Plague Inc. developer Ndemic just dropped a surprise sequel to the smash hit Plague Inc. Instead of a pessimistic pandemic simulator, the sequel is a sunny strategy game about rebuilding after the end of the world.</p><p>After Inc. is set in the aftermath of Plague Inc.'s zombie scenario. It tasks you with running human civilization in the United Kingdom after a zombie apocalypse. Unlike its predecessors, After Inc. has an optimistic hue. The aesthetic is colorful and painterly, in contrast to the harsh UI of Plague Inc. or the cold satellite-map style of Rebel Inc., a previous follow-up about combating insurgencies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of After Inc. showing off the game's bright, lush aesthetic and friendly UI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png"></figure><p>In an interview with newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, game designer James Vaughn said, â€œI've tried to make a more happy and optimistic game this time." In each session, you play as the leader of a settlement. You combat zombies, search for resources, navigate communal disputes, and research new tech. Playing through a scenario lasts around 20 minutes and will unlock meta upgrades that affect future settlements.</p><p>After Inc. costs $2, the same price as Rebel Inc. and $1 more than Plague Inc. The store page claims this is a "special sale price" to mark the game's launch. Ndemic promises "no 'consumable microtransactions,'" meaning any content you spend money on will last in the game forever. The app store page promises that it will be "updated for years to come." You can pick up After Inc. right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndemiccreations.afterinc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> and on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/after-inc/id1631859420?platform=iphone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A PC version</a> will launch sometime next year.</p><p>Plague Inc.'s sales sky-rocketed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/plague-inc-sales-rise-after-coronavirus-outbreak-b/1100-6473051/" data-ref-id="1100-6473051">the start of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">Video games have traditionally been an expensive hobby, but thanks to the latest advances in cloud streaming, it's now easier--and more affordable--than ever to get into gaming. One of the best cloud gaming services is Amazon Luna, which lets users play some of the latest games in up to 4K quality directly on devices they already own--no expensive console or gaming PC required. If that sounds like something you're interested in, we've put together this comprehensive explainer for Amazon Luna so you can see how easy it is to sign up and get playing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What is Amazon Luna?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4406070"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4406070-lunadevices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna is a cloud gaming service that allows users to stream games directly from the cloud to various devices without needing a gaming console. You can think of it like the video game version of Amazon's Prime Video service, where instead of downloading and running games directly on your hardware, they're stored and played remotely via Amazon's Web Services (AWS) servers.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of benefits to cloud gaming compared to traditional console or PC gaming. For one, you can access your library of games from a long list of devices, including Windows PCs, Macs, Fire TV streaming devices, Fire tablets, Chromebooks, iPhones, iPads, Android devices, and select smart TVs. While you'll need a strong, stable internet connection for the best gameplay experience, cloud gaming can be much cheaper, too, since all you need is a Luna account, a controller, and one of the supported devices--many of which you probably already own. That means there's no need to buy an expensive gaming console or PC.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Much Does Amazon Luna Cost?</h2><p dir="ltr">Amazon Luna requires a paid membership to access most of its games and features, but multiple subscription plans and optional add-ons are available to suit your preferences.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ membership</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The primary plan is <strong>Luna+</strong>, which costs <strong>$10/month</strong> and gets you access to over 100 games that are playable at no extra charge, including a mix of AAA games like <strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong> and <strong>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</strong>, and indies like <strong>Overcooked</strong> and <strong>Guacamelee</strong>. Luna+ members can also sync their Ubisoft store and GOG accounts and play select games they already own from those storefronts over the cloud via Amazon Luna.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the game libraries, Luna+ members can also link their Twitch accounts and broadcast their gameplay live.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A <strong>seven-day Luna+ free trial</strong></a> is available if you want to try out the service.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Luna+ add-ons</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Luna+ members can augment their libraries with a couple of paid add-on channels.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">If you're a fan of <strong>Ubisoft games</strong>, you can play a large library of the publisher's games on Luna--including new releases and classic titles--by adding the <strong>Ubisoft+ channel</strong> to your membership for an additional $18/month.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>The Jackbox Games Channel</strong> is also available for an additional $5/month, granting you access to the popular series of <strong>Jackbox party games</strong>.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon Prime</strong> subscribers ($15/month or $139/year) also get access to an additional rotating selection of games, including popular titles like <strong>Fortnite</strong>, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, and <strong>XDefiant</strong>, that you can play even without a Luna+ membership. Separate from Luna, Prime members also get a selection of free games via the Prime Gaming service, some of which are also playable on Luna.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What Equipment Do You Need?</h2><p dir="ltr">As mentioned above, Amazon Luna works on various devices, and you can also play via Chrome or Microsoft Edge web browsers on PC or Safari on Apple devices. You'll need at least one of the supported devices and/or web browsers to use Luna.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Amazon devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Fire TV streamers and smart TVs running FireOS 5 and above, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-lite-latest-alexa-voice-remote-lite/dp/B091G4YP57?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick Lite</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=fire+smart+tv&amp;crid=2YJV9MKHPNCK9&amp;sprefix=fire+smart%2Caps%2C383&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FireOS smart TVs</a></li><li dir="ltr">Fire Tablets like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 11 Max</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BL5XPDR6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 10</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire HD 8</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/dp/B096WJFX8M?tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire 7</a></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Apple devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">iPhones running iOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">iPads running iPadOS 15 and above</li><li dir="ltr">macOS running 10.13</li><li dir="ltr">Safari 15 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Android devices</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Android OS 9 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 86 and above</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>PC</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">Windows 10 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Chrome version 83 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Microsoft Edge version 90 and above</li><li dir="ltr">Linux, Ubuntu, and Chromium OS are also supported.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Select LG and Samsung smart TVs</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">You can check the full <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ref_=hp_left_v4_sib&amp;nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;tag=gamespot-lunacampaign1-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">list of supported devices here</a>.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>A controller</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Along with one of the supported devices or web browsers, Luna also requires a Bluetooth game controller to play. Amazon offers its own Luna controller, which is essentially the same as most other modern gamepads, but features Luna-specific branding and buttons for navigating the Luna app UI. These functions are mapped to different buttons on other supported controllers.

Unlike traditional consoles and gaming PCs, where graphical quality and gameplay speed depend on your hardware setup, cloud gaming performance depends on how strong and stable your internet connection is.</p><p dir="ltr">While you can play Luna games at a maximum 4K resolution, gameplay quality may vary if your connection wavers. Amazon's minimum network requirements are 10Mbps internet speeds for 1080p gaming and at least 35Mbps for 4K. You'll also want to use a hardwired Ethernet connection whenever possible. If you play over Wi-Fi, you will want to use 5Ghz routers (though 2.4Ghz Wi-Fi is also supported).
