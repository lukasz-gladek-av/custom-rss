                <p>In February 2023, Wizards of the Coast closed an internal game development studio, and with it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">cancelled multiple unannounced titles</a>, one of them being Whimpact!, a "Pokemon meets Fall Guys" online multiplayer game. Rather than let it die, Leah Hoyer, who was at the time VP of creative for WotC, opened her own studio called Level Headed Games, acquired the rights to Whimpact!, and continued development--and it's set to release in early access soon.</p><p>Whimpact! drops players into the world of Whims, cute little creatures that pass along magical powers to those who collect and care for them. The more they're cared for, the stronger those powers will be. Up to eight players will be able to join together in co-op arena-style gameplay as they collect Whims, gather mystical energy called Starcane, and navigate obstacles while fighting hordes of robotic invaders trying to steal the energy for themselves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NWrbMVN84E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4NWrbMVN84E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608412,1300-4608413,1300-4608414,1300-4608415,1300-4608416" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608412-affixedattack.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608413-chaosmountain.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608414-exponpc.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608415-marketplace.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4608416-whimtile.jpg"></figure><p>There are seven different types of Whims to collect, each with six different color variants. The power each Whim gives the player will depend on its color, with powers including increased speed, increased strength, high jumping ability, longer jumping ability, and more. Players will be able to mix and match powers, including swapping Whims on the fly, during a match as well.</p><p>Both the player characters and the Whims can also be customized with cosmetics including clothing, weapon skins, and the ability to decorate a home base for their characters called a Home Tile. The debut trailer gives us a look at some of the items players will be able to equip, including clothes, hats, and a watermelon sword.</p><p>No official release window has been announced for Whimpact! as of this writing, but the game will launch on PC in early access when it does become available.</p>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive, which has a new game--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a>--coming out in March 2026, has commented on Rockstar's decision to delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> from May 2026 to November 2026.</p><p>IO CEO Hakan Abrak was asked by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-io-interactive-interview-hakan-abrak-on-james-bond-dispatch-and-the-gta-6-delay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> if he feels pleased that GTA 6 moved further away from 007: First Light. "It would be a lie not to say that obviously spring looks really good," he said of 007: First Light's release window.</p><p>The game launches on March 27, which was about two months before GTA 6's May 26 release date before Rockstar pushed the game to November 19, 2026.</p><p>While Abrak may be relieved to know 007: First Light now has much more space between it and GTA 6, he said, "GTA 6 is a welcome thing for the industry." That's because, he said, GTA 6 could help bring lapsed gamers back, which could then help lift the industry overall.</p><p>"I do believe a lot of gamers who maybe haven't played for a while will get into things again, and generally for the industry as a whole, I think that will be amazing," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be an enormous success, with one estimate saying it could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and bring in more than $3 billion during its first year alone</a>. Before this, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said something similar in that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-does-not-scare-ubisoft-ceo-says/1100-6520931/" data-ref-id="1100-6520931">he's not afraid of GTA 6</a> because the game will amount to a rising tide lifting all ships. Not everyone is as optimistic, though. Industry expert Joost van Dreunen said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">"naive"</a> to think that one big release like GTA 6 will help solve the industry's issues. "It won't," he said.</p><h2><strong>007: First Light is done</strong></h2><p>Also in the interview, Abrak confirmed that 007: First Light is "done," and is now playable from start to end. The team is spending time now polishing the experience and fixing bugs. "The whole game is done. It's been a long journey--six years almost--but I'm very proud that we are here," he said.</p><p>The executive also confirmed that IO funded 007: First Light totally by itself from the success of the Hitman series as opposed to taking external funding for it. The studio is, however, working with the 007 rights-holders on the project, but apparently not for funding purposes.</p><p>IO is also making a new multiplayer fantasy game, and Abrak teased that IO is "working with some partners" on this game, whatever it turns out to be. "But James Bond is fully funded by us. We are completely independent," he said.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">For the first time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cloverpit/">CloverPit</a> is available on console after surprise-releasing yesterday on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox Game Pass (Ultimate and Premium tiers). The slot machine roguelike takes inspiration from Balatro and Buckshot Roulette, even featuring Jimbo from the former in the new Xbox launch trailer seen below. Players are tasked with paying off their gambling debt from inside a disgusting cell, and if they can't, they take a terrible tumble.</p><p dir="ltr">CloverPit originally came out on Steam on September 26. It was one of the games that actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-demo-released-for-game-delayed-by-silksong/1100-6534469/">delayed its release to avoid Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> on September 4. CloverPit planned to launch September 3 initially. That change of course seems to have played out favorably for the roguelike, as publisher Future Friends Games and developer Panik Arcade have stated CloverPit has sold over 1 million copies on Steam so far.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEGZsVMdizs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gEGZsVMdizs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Panik Arcade teased new DLC for CloverPit in the Xbox launch trailer as well. <a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1991584781004353984" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the developer notes that the add-on will be named Unholy Fusion and will release on PC and Xbox. However, it's unknown at this time if it will be free or paid DLC.</p><p>CloverPit costs $10 on Xbox for players without Game Pass Ultimate and Premium. The roguelike's surprise-release was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-partner-preview-showcase-every-game-and-announcement/2900-7271/#1"> part of the Xbox Partner Preview event</a> earlier this week. Another notable indie title headed to Game Pass was announced at the presentation, too: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-vampire-survivors-game-crawlers-is-a-big-departure-will-launch-on-game-pass/1100-6536365/">Vampire Crawlers</a>. It's the follow-up from developer Poncle to Vampire Survivors, though this time, the game is a deckbuilding dungeon crawler.</p>
