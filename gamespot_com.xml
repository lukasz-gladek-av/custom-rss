                <p>From Software has issued an apology for the connection issues currently plaguing the Elden Ring Nightreign network test.</p><p>From Software's Japanese player-support account on <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_sp/status/1890361803944718443" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> said that the servers are currently congested, which is making it difficult for players to match with each other. The account suggested to continue trying and apologized for any inconvenience.</p><p>It seems like the PlayStation servers are being hit particularly hard. "Nightfarers, the Nightreign PlayStation servers are currently under maintenance," said the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1890375493611851834" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Elden Ring Twitter account</a>. "Work is ongoing to restore server functionality. Further updates will be provided. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p><p>The network test is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-playtest-invites-are-going-out/1100-6529387/" data-ref-id="1100-6529387">split into five different sessions</a> starting from today, February 14, until February 16. Each session is only three hours long, so the server issues really eat away a chunk of the available time that players have to try out Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches on May 30 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. It will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-launches-in-may-has-no-microtransactions/1100-6529408/" data-ref-id="1100-6529408">not have any microtransactions, but will have a one-time purchase DLC</a>.</p><p>For more Elden Ring Nightreign coverage, make sure to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-talks-about-attacking-friends-for-their-own-good-and-other-new-elden-ring-nightreign-ideas/1100-6529380/" data-ref-id="1100-6529380">interview with director Junya Ishizaki</a> as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">preview impressions</a>.</p><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds beta test also experienced network issues last weekend, although that was PlayStation's fault as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psn-is-down/1100-6529341/" data-ref-id="1100-6529341">PSN was down for nearly 24 hours</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Los Angeles and surrounding areas were ravaged by devastating wildfires. At the time, Pokemon Go developer Niantic assured fans that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-gos-unova-tour-in-la-will-go-on-but-niantic-is-monitoring-wildfires/1100-6528751/" data-ref-id="1100-6528751">Pokemon Go Unova Tour - Los Angeles event</a> would go on as scheduled in February.
