                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/" data-ref-id="5000-654217">A Game About Digging A Hole</a> is the aptly named new game from indie developer Cyberwave, and it is, you guessed it, about digging a hole.</p><p dir="ltr">For what Cyberwave describes "costs as much of a coffee, but is fun for longer," A Game About Digging A Hole sees players buy a mysterious house for an "unbeatable price." That house just so happens to have buried treasure in the backyard, leading players to start digging to discover the riches underneath.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Ys4PRZxsw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P-Ys4PRZxsw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's a simple premise with an even simpler gameplay loop. Players will dig, find treasure, sell those treasures, use the money to upgrade their digging tools, and keep digging deeper. The game's announcement trailer teases there may be something more sinister lurking in the deep, dark depths, but that will be for players to discover, as Cyberwave teases a "big secret" hidden beneath the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">An eye-catching and hilariously straightforward name definitely seems to be part of the game's marketing strategy. In a blog post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Cyberwave asks players to help make the "quirky" project "go viral" so that it's "the game everyone's talking about."</p><p dir="ltr">The original idea for the game came during the development of Cyberwave's upcoming floating island survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solarpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-559930">Solarpunk</a>. It was experimenting with voxel-based terraforming, only to eventually ditch the idea. One of the game's artists, inspired by the tech and the game Motherload, then put together what would become A Game About Digging A Hole in just 14 days of his spare time. Solarpunk itself is not out yet and is planned for a 2025 release, but Cyberwave emphasized that A Game About Digging A Hole didn't take a single day from Solarpunk's development.</p><p dir="ltr">A Game About Digging A Hole doesn't have an exact release date or price just yet but is slated to arrive in 2025 for PC.</p>
