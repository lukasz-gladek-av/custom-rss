what exactly it counts in this engagement metric. While Dragon Age: The Veilguard's underperformance disappointed the company, EA claims that a "majority of the change" in net bookings comes from Global Football--and more specifically, the release of EA Sports FC 25--not meeting expectations during Q3.</p><p>EA did not share specific player engagement numbers for EA Sports FC 25, simply explaining that it underperformed following two years of growth for the franchise. EA appears to have faith in the recovery of its Global Football efforts, with Andrew Wilson praising EA Sports FC 25's recent Team of the Year update.</p><p>Both Dragon Age: The Veilguard and EA Sports FC 25 received generally favorable reviews from critics, sitting at aggregated <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scores of 82</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76 on Metacritic</a>, respectively.</p><p>We'll learn more about the implications of each game's underperformance when EA holds a conference call about its Q3 financial results on February 4. If you want to play the games in question for yourself, EA Sports FC 25 is available for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch, while Dragon Age: The Veilguard is on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X.</p>

                <p>Several popular gaming-related subreddits are banning posts that link to social media site X (formerly Twitter). Among those issuing the ban are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1i7f9br/rsteamdeck_will_no_longer_allow_links_to_x/?share_id=iV0qYi-9g5id_e-aHsrW9&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/SteamDeck</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1i7ideu/x_twitter_links_are_banned_from_rmonsterhunter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/MonsterHunter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1i7ivkr/posts_linking_to_twitterx_are_now_banned_in_rwow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/WOW</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/PCGaming,</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1i73hne/rnintendo_joins_other_subreddits_in_banning_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Nintendo</a>.</p><p>These bans are part of a larger movement on Reddit to ban X content. Since the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/esatdedezade/2025/01/22/x-ban-spreads-across-reddit-as-communities-react-to-musks-gesture/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">influx of blacklisting</a> began, there have been a number of posts made across various subreddits raising the question of if the respective subreddit should follow suit. Currently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/1i6y5cw/should_rhalo_ban_or_restrict_xtwitter_posts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Halo</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1i7d4mj/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/RPG</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ValorantCompetitive/comments/1i6ozcd/proposal_to_ban_xcom_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/Valorant</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1i7c49p/proposal_to_ban_x_links/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">r/AnimalCrossing</a>, and several other prominent subreddits are in discussions, with the majority of subscribers currently in favor of a prohibiting content pulled from X. The extent of the bans vary from subreddit to subreddit, with r/Nintendo and r/SteamDeck allowing screenshots while r/WOW is prohibiting images as well.</p><p>The official reasons for the ban vary, though many cite Elon Musk's recent actions as the primary motivation. Musk, who owns X, recently attended President Trump's inauguration and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/21/the-gesture-speaks-for-itself-germans-divided-over-musks-apparent-nazi-salute" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was seen doing a Nazi-like salute</a>. However, different forums have also cited X's lack of moderation and "increasingly hateful" content as reason to blacklist the website.</p><p>"This is something that we've been contemplating for a little while now," r/PCGaming moderator Shock4ndAwe <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1i6v0j5/as_of_today_rpcgaming_has_added_xcom_to_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. "X has become increasingly hateful, toxic and less and less moderated. This has, in turn, made us less comfortable with letting our subreddit link it to other people. Not to mention the distasteful things Elon Musk has done recently."</p><p>r/WOW, a World of Warcraft forum boasting over 3 million members, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1i6mjqc/rmagictcg_and_the_website_formerly_known_as/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stated</a> that a combination of "recent political events" and X's declining reliability as a news source contributed to its decision. r/MagicTCG, a subreddit dedicated to Magic the Gathering, confirmed that its users were "overwhelmingly in favor" of a ban due to "Nazi behavior from the owner."</p><p>Though some news outlets and citizens continue to debate if Musk's gesture was a Nazi salute, German and Jewish communities alike have expressed their belief that the gesture was antisemitic. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, condemned Musk, stating that while "everyone can say what he wants, even if he is a billionaire, what we do not accept is if this is supporting extreme right positions."</p>

Through the first three games, voice actor Doug Cockle portrayed the previous main character, Geralt of Rivia, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">he will reprise his role in the sequel</a> as well. But Cockle is far from disappointed about taking a backseat this time, and he's eager to see Ciri get the spotlight.</p><p>"I'm really excited," Cockle told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-decision-to-go-with-ciri-as-protagonist-for-the-witcher-4-a-really-interesting-move-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-geralt-actor-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I think it's a really good move. I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because... I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done."</p><p>Cockle also related that CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">gently admonished him</a> for sharing his theories about Geralt's presence in the game.</p><p>"I was never really out of their good books," said Cockle. "All developers are like this. They want to keep their surprises and I actually didn't know anything, so I was just making guesses at things and stuff like that. And probably one of their requests was to just to stop guessing, 'Doug, you might be right. You might not be right. It doesn't matter if you are talking me. Doug, who plays Geralt, whatever you say is going to be taken as something.' So it was a very, very light slap on the wrist. It wasn't really a big deal."</p><p>Cockle is reprising his role as Geralt in Netflix's upcoming animated film, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-faces-a-war-between-the-land-and-the-sea-in-the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep/1100-6528810/" data-ref-id="1100-6528810">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a>. That will premiere on Netflix on February 11, while The Witcher Season 4 is expected to arrive later this year. As for The Witcher 4, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">ramped up production</a> at the end of 2024, and the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Captain Blood, a pirate-themed action-adventure game that was supposed to launch in 2010 but has been stuck in development hell since then, will finally come out on May 6.</p><p>Captain Blood is an Xbox 360-era action-adventure game through and through, following a pirate captain on a quest to save a damsel in distress after other, more evil, pirates kidnap her. To accomplish that, the titular antihero needs to punch, slash, and shoot his way through anyone who gets in their way, completing the occasional quick-time event or fighting powerful enemy bosses. It looks like a throwback to action games on consoles like PS2 and Xbox 360, which makes sense as that's the era of gaming Captain Blood is actually from.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvC9RGxq68w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DvC9RGxq68w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/age-of-pirates-captain-blood" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Development on Captain Blood</a> reportedly began as far back as 2003, as Russian developer Akella planned to make a game based on a novel by author Rafael Sabatini. A game titled Captain Blood was first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/04/22/1c-announces-e3-line-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teased at E3 2004</a>, but it switched teams and restarted development multiple times before the project settled with publisher 1C Company around 2008. GameSpot even went <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/captain-blood-hands-on/1100-6192241/" data-ref-id="1100-6192241">hands-on with Captain Blood</a> around this time, already lamenting that it had "been in development for several years now." While a release was supposed to happen by 2010, it kept getting delayed and ended up never releasing due to parties involved with the game going bankrupt and other legal challenges surrounding the game.</p><p>All of that meant Captain Blood was left stuck in development hell after 2010...until now. In 2024, video game publisher SNEG Ltd. acquired the rights to Captain Blood and began working on an offical release. After one last small delay from late 2024 to 2025, we finally have a concrete release date for this action-adventure game. While we have no idea whether or not the game itself is any good, it's impressive that a game that seemed cursed to never release is finally coming out.</p><p>Captain Blood launches for PC, Steam, Mac, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on May 6, priced at $25.</p>

                <p>Thus far, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest gaming story of 2025, and there's barely been any definitive word on the subject aside from the announcement video earlier this month. Nintendo hasn't even disclosed any upcoming games besides <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">an apparent Mario Kart sequel</a>. Now, online retailer Newegg has kicked off another round of speculation by listing new Mario and Zelda games coming this year as well.</p><p>Newegg is selling <a href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop gift cards</a>, which includes a brief list of some of Nintendo's upcoming titles. Some of the games--including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-trailer-shows-off-the-remasters-switch-glow-up/1100-6528711/" data-ref-id="1100-6528711">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>--were already confirmed and announced. However, putting titles down like "New 3D Mario, New Mario Kart, [and] a Legend of Zelda remake/remaster" is going to attract attention.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't confirmed that a new Mario game or a Zelda remake/remaster are on the way, and it's likely their inclusion here was either a mistake or guesswork. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/super-mario-odyssey-review/1900-6416795/" data-ref-id="1900-6416795">Super Mario Odyssey</a> was one of the first big games on Switch, and it seems very probable that Nintendo will have the next AAA Mario game for Switch 2. It also stands to reason that another Legend of Zelda won't be far behind. Whether either or both projects are real and ready to arrive this year remains to be seen.</p><p>Although more information about Switch 2 will be revealed at the Nintendo Direct on April 2, the company has shared a new video that reveals <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-video-reveals-how-snappy-joy-con-removal-works/1100-6528933/" data-ref-id="1100-6528933">how the snappy Joy-Con removal works</a>. Meanwhile, a Switch developer has offered his breakdown of the Switch 2 reveal to explain <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-significantly-more-powerful-according-to-a-game-dev/1100-6528921/" data-ref-id="1100-6528921">the sheer power of the new system</a>. Nintendo hasn't revealed a more specific release date than 2025 for Switch 2 yet, but some are predicting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-some-believe-the-switch-2-may-not-launch-until-june/1100-6528854/" data-ref-id="1100-6528854">a June launch</a>.</p>
