First <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-debuts-trailer-and-release-date-for-next-expansion/1100-6528201/">unveiled in early December</a>, Agents of Sabotage brings loads of content to the table, including a new property for purchase called The Darnell Bros Garment Factory, new missions, and of course, new wheels.</p><p dir="ltr">"After purchasing the legendary Darnell Bros Garment Factory, players will head underground to take on Los Santos’ super-rich and the military-industrial complex in a series of multi-part high-stakes scores employing the latest clandestine technology," Rockstar said of the expansion's plotline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4413279-gtaonline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4413279-gtaonline.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4413279"></a><figcaption>This update is sure to bring out your inner sneak-thief.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4413279-gtaonline.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new factory, the Agents of Sabotage expansion also includes the following features:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Brand-new property:</strong> Players can purchase The Darnell Bros Garment Factory, but what's in the factory is the real treat. It's equipped with a Mk. 2 Weapon Workshop, Personal Quarters, a safe for passive income, 10 storage slots for player vehicles, and a garage with a basement that provides access to the Los Santos' underground tunnels, allowing players who own the factory to travel to and from different areas with ease.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The FIB Files:</strong> The FIB Files include four new multi-stage missions for players to complete in return for rewards. Tasks include downing an IAA-protected aircraft, lifting military tech from Fort Zancudo, recovering a missing piece of art (without being seen), and accessing Maze Bank’s secret slush fund.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Dispatch Work: </strong>Agents of Sabotage introduces two new Dispatch Work missions, which see players lending a hand to Vincent Effenburger of the Los Santos Police Department.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Benefactor Terrorbyte Upgrades: </strong>The Terrorbyte's upgrades include a Collectible Scanner (for the collectible-hunter in all of us), a Master Control Terminal (to keep track of players' business stock, supplies, vehicle storage, and cargo), a Missile Lock-On Jammer (preventing enemies from locking on), and Silent Running mode (which hides the vehicle's radar blip).</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>New Wheels</strong>: Several new vehicles have been added to the game, including the Banshee GTS (which is free to claim for GTA+ Members through January 8), the Chavos V6, the Dinka Jester RR Widebody, and law enforcement versions of the Canis Terminus Patrol and Vapid Caracara Pursuit.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Heist Challenge rewards:</strong> Players who completed an eligible Heist Finale from November 7 - December 4 will earn the NOOSE Outfit. Meanwhile, the Police Predator boat is available to claim (via Warstock) by all players until December 15.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Quality-of-life improvements:</strong> Payouts for Drift and Drag Races have been improved, and will now automatically grant Body Armor when launching (and relaunching) missions. Additionally, players can now toggle through siren options when driving law-enforcement vehicles.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Rockstar, there's more new content heading to GTA Online in the near future. Upcoming features include holiday events, new Stunt Races celebrating the Lunar New Year, new Drift Races, the new El Strickler Military Rifle (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players only), and additional Transform Race tools for the Rockstar Creator.</p><p>GTA Online's free Agents of Sabotage expansion is available now on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.

                <p>Several first-party PlayStation games have found their way to PC over the past few years, and now’s your chance to pick them up for cheap. A handful of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CBNN7BP1,B0CZPM4KLZ,B0CBNQPBCY,B0CLYZD4X2,B0CLYZ1FCP,B0CBNPMX7P&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Studios PC games are discounted at Amazon</a> ahead of the holidays,<strong> all of which are offered as digital Steam keys</strong>--making this a great time to pile a few more games into your ever-growing Steam library. The only caveat? Most of these deals are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime</a> members. Consider signing up to cash in on the deals, however, as you’ll also gain access to free shipping, the impressive Prime Video catalog, monthly free games via Prime gaming, and tons of other benefits.</p><p>The best deals in the bunch include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sackboy: A Big Adventure</a> for $12.59 (was $60), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> for $27 (was $60), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-War-Standard-Online-Game/dp/B0CBNQPBCY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War</a> (2018) for just $20 (was $50). If you pick up God of War (or have already played it on PS4 or PS5), the Steam version of the sequel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/God-War-Ragnar%C3%B6k-Standard-Online/dp/B0D8M459CW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">God of War: Ragnarok</a> is also available on Amazon, and while it's not on sale, it's worth adding to your shopping cart if you want to continue Kratos and Atreus’ journey.</p><p>One of the newest games on sale is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HELLDIVERS-Standard-Online-Game-Code/dp/B0CLYZ1FCP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Helldivers 2</a>, as you’ll find it for just $32 (was $40). The popular cooperative shooter tasks you and three friends with repelling aliens, robots, and other evil creatures from inching their way toward Super Earth. Its player count isn’t anywhere near its all-time high from earlier this year, but you’ll regularly find around 20,000 others online--making it easy to find a crew for your next mission. For a jumpstart, consider springing for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HELLDIVERS-Standard-Online-Game-Code/dp/B0CLYZD4X2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Citizen Edition</a> that’s on sale for $48 (was $60). Along with the base game, you’ll get various cosmetics, such as an armor set and cape, plus a premium Warbond with additional unlockables.</p><p>You'll find a list of all the discounted PlayStation Studios PC releases listed below. It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CBNN7BP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart's</a> discount is the only price cut that is available to all shoppers; the rest require an Amazon Prime account to access the deals.

Luckily, you can snag a long list of DualSense colors at big discounts, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSenseTM-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CQKLS4RP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard white model</a> for $54 (was $75) or flashier options like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-DualSenseTM-Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CJTCQRNL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sterling Silver edition</a> for $59 (was $80).
