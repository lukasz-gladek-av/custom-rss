                <p>Microsoft recently cut thousands of jobs as part of its latest round of mass layoffs, and as part of the drawback, the company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">canceled the new Perfect Dark and closed its developer, The Initiative.</a></p><p>The studio's top boss, Darrell Gallagher, has now written a eulogy of sorts for Perfect Dark and The Initiative, while also confirming his own departure from Microsoft.</p><p>"After an incredible journey, my time at Xbox has come to a close with the wind-down of Perfect Dark and The Initiative. I couldn't be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead," Gallagher said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373350179040714752/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. "Together, we set out to reimagine an iconic franchise and poured creativity, craft, and dedication into every step of the way. The public reception and excitement for what we were building has been inspiring and deeply appreciated by all of us."</p><p>Gallagher said the "spirit, talent, and achievements" of the developers will live on "well beyond the project."</p><p>"I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what's next--both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with. Here's to new adventures and to celebrating the journey we've shared," Gallagher said.</p><p>Gallagher has worked in the video game industry for decades, having spent time at Rockstar Games as a lead artist, then at THQ as studio art director. He later joined Crystal Dynamics and was the art director and later head of studio before being promoted to become head of product development and studios at Square Enix. He joined Activision in 2016 and was a senior vice president and head of development for various Call of Duty games. In 2018, he joined Xbox to establish The Initiative and kick off work on the reimagining of Perfect Dark.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite co-developer Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development. GTA parent company Take-Two apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-almost-got-a-second-chance-at-take-two-report/1100-6534419/" data-ref-id="1100-6534419">almost stepped in to save Perfect Dark</a>, but a deal didn't come together in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by the latest wave of layoffs at Microsoft. The Initiative was the only studio that was closed, but other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software also saw layoffs</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> was also canceled.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 boss Randy Pitchford is encouraging people to request refunds if they aren't enjoying the newly launched game, and now one publisher known for being cheeky has weighed in and offered up an alternative.</p><p>Devolver Digital said anyone who gets a refund for Borderlands 4 can spend that money on one of its games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mycopunk</a>, which launched in July and costs $15. The game bears some stylistic resemblances to Borderlands 4, and, like that game, is also a co-op shooter set on an alien planet.</p><p>You can buy Mycopunk from GameSpot sister site Fanatical.</p><p>Devolver is known for capitalizing on wider games industry talking points to promote its own games. For example, the publisher has maintained that it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">intentionally launch a game the same day as GTA 6</a>, something the company re-committed to after GTA 6 was delayed to May 2026.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Pitchford has been posting non-stop since Borderlands 4 launched on September 12. He's involving himself in the discussion about Borderlands 4's PC version, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">calling people "4K stubborn" and disputing reports of performance issues.</a> In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">one highly publicized post</a>, Pitchford said, "Please get a refund from Steam if you aren't happy with it."</p><p>Exactly how many people are getting Borderlands 4 refunds is unknown. As of September 17, the game remains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's No. 1 best-selling game in the US.</a> It's also in the top 10 for most-played games on Steam right now, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exceeding 200,000 peak concurrent users today.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 has a "mixed" aggregate rating on Steam. Developer Gearbox has sent out an alert about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-new-borderlands-4-bug-may-steal-all-your-skill-points/1100-6534784/" data-ref-id="1100-6534784">a bug that may erase all of your skill points</a>. Gearbox has also noted the PC performance problems <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/having-borderlands-4-pc-issues-or-crashes-gearbox-has-some-advice/1100-6534674/">and offered several suggestions for players</a> to manage them.

The Switch 2 port will be released on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">During last week's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix surprised Dragon Quest fans with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-remake-announced-after-months-of-speculation/1100-6534696/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, a remake of the classic PlayStation RPG from the year 2000. It seems Square Enix was not done with the surprise Dragon Quest reveals, as today the company announced Dragon Quest Smash/Grow, a roguelite RPG for mobile devices that will enter a closed beta test next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow tasks players with fighting hordes of enemies at once, "smashing" through their ranks in order to "grow" their characters with experience and loot. Once powerful enough, players can then unleash powerful Coup de Grace attacks in order to finish the enemy armies off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3mPefOfho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6U3mPefOfho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The roguelite mechanic in Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is called Blessings, which are chosen from randomly generated options throughout the course of a run. Each run will depend on the Blessings made available to a player throughout the adventure; as is typical with roguelite games, no two runs will feel exactly alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow will be available for both iOS and Android devices. A closed beta test for Dragon Quest Smash/Grow has been announced for October 14-21. Players can pre-regiser for the beta test on iOS using TestFlight, Android via the Google Play Store, and at the <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt" rel="nofollow ">game's official website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been busy with reveals over the past few months across many of its RPG franchises. Along with Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Smash/Grow, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade was confirmed for a January 22 release on Nintendo Switch 2, while Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales were both announced over the summer.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>If you've played any PC or console games over the last 12 months, there's a good chance that at least one of them was a remake or a remaster. That's according to new research, which found that not only have these games been popular with the people they polled for this research, they've also been "desirable" diversions.</p><p>Specialist strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) polled 1,500 people--750 people each in the US and the UK--who play games regularly. "Our report shows that there is a strong appeal for remakes and remasters, but it's a tight balancing act for studios to get right," said Martin Bradley, head of gaming at MTM. "Many of these games are far out-selling their original release."</p>

<p>MTM also revealed that 85% of the people who played a remaster or remake in the last year had not even played the original version of the game, so this wasn't entirely a case of nostalgia guiding their choices. That being said, MTM added that nostalgia is still a powerful influence, even when gamers understand that they might be missing out on fresher and novel gameplay experiences by choosing reimagined games over newer titles.</p><p>It hasn't been difficult to find a remastered game either, as publishers have focused their efforts on reviving classic games in addition to new projects. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">one of the best-selling games of the year so far</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the House of the Dead 2: Remake were all released this year, and looking ahead, remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-remake-sounds-like-its-still-a-long-ways-away/1100-6532621/">Persona 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">Splinter Cell</a> are also on the way.</p><p>Nintendo has also been keenly aware of the value of its older games for years now, and while it has produced several remakes and remasters, it's even going a step further this year by remaking its flop Virtual Boy console--sort of.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/">Virtual Boy functionality is coming</a> February 17, 2026, to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, and to play these games, you'll need a new accessory modeled after the original console that you can slot your Switch or Switch 2 device into.</p>

                <p>EA's new Skate game, the first in 15 years, launched this week and put up big numbers on Steam for its early-access release. The launch hasn't gone over totally smoothly, however, as players encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-server-queues-lead-to-complaints-about-always-online-requirement/1100-6534790/" data-ref-id="1100-6534790">server issues and other problems</a>. Another issue people are reporting is a "softlock" problem that prevents people from accessing certain points in the skateboarding game.</p><p>"We've seen a lot of reports on getting softlocked in various points--the Isle of Grom Tutorial, various Missions and/or Challenges," the developer <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/skate-bug-reports-en/softlock-mega-thread/12581740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wrote in the game's forums</a>. "The Full Circle team are working to identify the cause of the issues and get a fix out as soon as possible, but we need some info."</p><p>EA is asking people to <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/skate-bug-reports-en/softlock-mega-thread/12581740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply to this thread</a> if they're softlocked--which is to say, they cannot complete a mission, challenge, or the tutorial. Players should submit information like what platform they're on, what specific mission or challenge is affected, and their username.</p><p>"Thanks for your patience. We're on it," EA said.</p><p>Skate is a free-to-play, always-online game, and the servers ran into issues on launch day. There was an "ongoing outage" overnight that prompted EA to conduct maintenance--and <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968127349284811247" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that's now resolved.</a></p><p>The version of Skate people are playing now is unfinished and known to include bugs and other issues, which is pretty standard for early-access games. EA and Full Circle have said they will examine feedback to try to make the full release better whenever it's ready.</p><p>Skate is out now for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. The game reached <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 80,000 peak concurrent users today on Steam</a>, and that's just on one platform.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mutant-football-league-2/">Mutant Football League 2</a> developer Digital Dreams has announced that the game will officially launch for PC and console on <strong>December 10</strong>. Originally launching in early access last year on PC--and in February 2025 on Xbox Series X|S via Game Preview--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-isnt-the-only-football-game-you-can-play-to-get-hyped-for-the-super-bowl/1100-6529297/">the NFL Blitz meets Evil Dead sports game</a> is the successor to the 2017 cult-classic football game, with the franchise first kicking off in the '90s under creator Michael Mendheim.</p><p>Like EA's popular Madden series, Mutant Football League 2 is focused on the rough-and-tough sport, but it's arguably better because you can tackle the opposition so violently that they can explode into a gory cloud of pink mist. The game mixes a dark sense of humor with 8-vs-8 arcade-style action between teams of Orcs, mutants, undead skeletons, and murderous robots. To make things even more ultraviolent, each arena is packed with deadly traps and sinister hazards like buzzsaws and giant mutant worms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mutant Football League - Official Release Date Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Basically, if you're looking for an anti-Madden football game, this will probably appeal to you as you'll have to guide a team of rookies to the top of the Mutant Football League through its single-player season, Dynasty Supreme franchise mode, and online multiplayer.</p><p>Some of the big features in the sequel include 36 MFL teams to choose from, buildcrafting to power up your team's abilities with legal performance-enhancers like Skillroids, and the opportunity to create your very own stadium loaded with deathtraps.</p><p>"Mutant League is my bastard child that I've loved since its inception in the early nineties. And now, against all odds, our small team of passionate and dedicated developers has managed to resurrect it for a new generation," said creative director Michael Mendheim. "At its core, it’s fun, hard-hitting, and unpredictable--easy to pick up and play, yet layered with depth and strategy."</p><p>If you're interested in scoring a few vicious touchdowns, you can pick up the game on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>
