                <p>Are you wondering about how long it takes to beat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538"><strong>Hell Is Us</strong></a>? This action-adventure offering from Rogue Factor combines sci-fi elements and a bit of dark fantasy horror on the side. Apart from facing ferocious foes, you also have to contend with a bunch of brain-teasing puzzles.</p><h2>How long to beat Hell Is Us - Campaign length and main missions</h2><p>On average, it should take you around <strong>12 to 20 hours</strong> to complete Hell Is Us' campaign. You might be curious as to why there's a huge gap in the estimates. Well, that's because you can tweak the game's difficulty while you're playing. These include lowering the health, base damage, and aggressiveness of enemies. So, if you feel like focusing more on exploration instead of combat, then encounters against hostile foes shouldn't present too much of a challenge.</p><p>That said, if you're more of a completionist, then trying to find every single item, upgrade, and secret in Hell Is Us could take you anywhere from <strong>25 to 35 hours</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556327"></a><figcaption>The Lymbic Forge is where you need to place your Keystones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg"></figure><h2>Hell Is Us main missions list</h2><p>These are the main missions in the campaign:</p><ul><li>Family Reunion</li><li>Family Legacy</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Terror</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Rage</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Ecstasy</li><li>[REDACTED]</li></ul><p>The Family Legacy and Family Reunion arcs comprise the game's first act. From there, the campaign opens up into a longer second act where you search for artifacts known as Keystones. Each individual arc has an investigation that leads to two or three zones as well.
