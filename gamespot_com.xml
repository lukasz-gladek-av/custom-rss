                <p>Few games pack the technical punch of Cyberpunk 2077, making it an interesting proposition for Nintendo's shiny new handheld. While the Switch 2 is a significant upgrade to the original, Cyberpunk 2077 is considered one of the most hardware-intensive games in recent years. Despite this, CD Projekt Red's ambitious Switch 2 port is a commendable one that makes the most of the console's power, but with some noticeable drawbacks.</p><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 for the Switch 2 offers a performance mode and quality mode for both docked and handheld play, with the key difference between the two play styles being resolution. While docked, Cyberpunk 2077's resolution ranges between 540p and 1080p. In quality mode, it shouldn't fall below 720p. Handheld play, depending on the graphics mode, scales between 360p and 810p. This sounds rough, but given the screen size and DLSS, Cyberpunk 2077 looks pretty palatable on the Nintendo Switch 2. Post-processing effects help offset this low resolution and the Switch 2 screen boasts a clean image, especially at a standstill. The quality can vary depending on what's happening on screen, though. If you're speeding through Night City or in the heat of combat, the resolution may plummet, but most players probably won't be able to tell.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520143"></a><figcaption>Johnny Silverhand looking at V with Night City in the background captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520143-01_cp2077_mousecontrols.mov.00_28_23_18.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quality mode targets 30 frames per second and performance mode targets 40. The caveat is that performance mode while docked only works with 120Hz TVs and monitors, meaning that not every display can utilize the frame rate boost. However, in my testing, the frame rate boost seemed pretty negligible when compared to quality mode. This is largely due to the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 does not support variable refresh rate while docked, meaning the frame rate dips are noticeable. Fortunately, the quality setting appears to be more consistent. The frame rate can fluctuate depending on where you are in the world and what's happening. Thanks to the Switch 2's built-in VRR screen, performance mode feels pretty solid while playing handheld. That said, Dog Town--the new district added in the Phantom Liberty DLC--appears to be particularly taxing on the Switch 2. It's far from unplayable, but it does run slightly worse than other parts of the city. This shouldn't come as a surprise considering Phantom Liberty never made it to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One due to technical limitations. That makes its inclusion on the Switch 2 all the more noteworthy.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to get Cyberpunk 2077 running on the Switch 2, the visuals have noticeably been pared back. While it doesn't feel as extreme of a downgrade as The Witcher 3's 2019 Switch port, those who played Cyberpunk 2077 on a high-end PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5 will definitely see the difference. Draw distances are reined in, textures aren't as detailed, and the lighting isn't as crisp. That said, it does appear to outpace last-gen consoles--perhaps not in every way, but I'd much rather play Cyberpunk 2077 on my Switch 2 than my creaky old Xbox One. For me, the most notable differences are the smaller crowd sizes and emptier roads. At times, especially in the downtown areas, Night City feels a bit empty. Concessions had to be made, and I understand why this was chief among them, but wandering around a quiet city center can take me out of the experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520144"></a><figcaption>The hacking menu on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520144-04_cp2077_frameratemode.mov.00_18_25_088.still002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cyberpunk 2077 isn't just a straightforward port to the Nintendo Switch 2. CD Projekt Red has leveraged the console's hardware to add in some new ways to play. The most interesting of the bunch are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/">mouse controls</a>. This lets you use a Joy-Con as a mouse in order to aim, and it works well. Once I tweaked the sensitivity, I had no trouble lining up headshots and gunning down enemies from afar. It's a little awkward maneuvering with mouse controls outside of combat, and the default button layout took some getting used to, but it feels like more than just a gimmick. I could see myself playing for dozens of hours with mouse controls turned on. However, the gyro controls <em>do</em> feel like a gimmick. Using a Pro Controller or Joy-Con, you can aim using motion; it's not quite as imprecise as it sounds, but it's certainly not the ideal way to play Cyberpunk 2077. The more approachable, middle ground is to use the gyro controls for subtle adjustments while aiming. You can control your camera with the right stick, but when you need to make a slight adjustment you can use the motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, CD Projekt Red has added touch controls to the experience. This primarily lets you navigate menus with your finger. As someone who has put in over 250 hours into Cyberpunk, navigating the menu with analog sticks is muscle memory at this point, so I've largely ignored this feature (I also don't like getting fingerprints on my screens). However, the touch screen controls are intuitive and could alleviate some of the inventory management issues that newer players might experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4520145"></a><figcaption>V holding a pistol outside of Night City captured on the Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4520145-02_cp2077_gyrocontrols.mov.00_06_48_15.still003.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Quite possibly the coolest feature in the Switch 2 version is cross-progression, letting you transfer your saves between PC and console. This isn't new for Cyberpunk or CD Projekt Red, but it makes this package considerably more inviting. After I completed Phantom Liberty for the first time in 2023, I've been slowly chipping away at a 100% playthrough, and cross-progression makes that even more attainable. The Witcher 3 for Switch eventually got cross-play, but for that functionality to work on day one with Cyberpunk 2077 is commendable.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've never played Cyberpunk 2077 and the Switch 2 is your only means to do so, then it's an easy recommendation. The base game is excellent and the Phantom Liberty expansion is phenomenal. However, if you've already played Cyberpunk 2077 and don't feel an itch to return to Night City, then this may not be worth your time. The Switch 2-specific features are a nice touch--and it's great to see CD Projekt Red embracing the hardware--but they don't elevate Cyberpunk 2077 beyond its already impressive pedestal.</p>

                <p>IO Interactive has partnered with Moon Publishing to create Hitman: The Board Game. In it, up to four players can try their luck at taking down contracts using a variety of items and weapons pulled directly from past Hitman games. Hits will take place across the globe, as the game's various boards allow for a number of familiar locations to make an appearance. However, traps, different entry and exit points, and other obstacles should keep infiltrations feeling fresh. It looks like it’ll be a ton of fun, if Moon’s upcoming Kickstarter is successful.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWJkaRKSaFM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWJkaRKSaFM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moon Publishing is known for creating solid table top experiences, including one based on Ghost Ship Games’ Deep Rock Galactic. That game came with several mini-figs, dice, and more, and even got an expansion. Based on the trailer, Hitman: The Board Game will potentially be just as be involved.</p><p>Already Moon released a few weeks back showcased different characters and boards, and a successful Kickstarter could mean more of both; it would be cool to get additional packs of high-profile targets and/or expansions offering iconic environments from the games.</p><p>Agent 47 has been on the move as of late. Even going so far as to target a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">James Bond villain</a> in a recent Hitman: World of Assassination update. This Hitman: The Board Game, however, could mark a new first for the iconic assassin. Fans looking to make this a reality can head over to Moon Publishing's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moodpublishing/hitman-the-board-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a> and hit the “notify me on launch” button.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fast-fusion/" data-ref-id="5000-671284">Fast Fusion</a> has the distinction of being one of the few Switch 2-exclusive games available now, and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/fast-fusion/critic-reviews/?platform=nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">people seem to like it quite a bit so far</a>. Not content to rest on its laurels after the game's release, developer Shin'en is releasing a free content update later this week for the game that includes three new racetracks.</p><p>As originally reported by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/exclusive-fast-fusions-first-major-update-arrives-this-week-with-three-new-tracks" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>, Fast Fusion's update will launch on June 26 and will include three new tracks, significantly expanding the game's offerings. From screenshots, these tracks will explore both urban and more natural areas, and will feature various types of weather.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XB5Hf2HIroc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XB5Hf2HIroc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this content drop, the update will also bring some tweaks and changes to help improve the game's performance. Shin'en is adding a "Pure" graphics mode that turns off upscaling and renders the game at 1440p dynamic resolution while docked and 1080p while handheld, in an effort to reduce any graphical blurriness caused by DLSS. The studio is also fixing some bugs and making progression slightly easier. You can check out the full patch notes below.</p><p>Fast Fusion is the third entry in the Fast series of hovercraft racing games, and it boasts 4K/60FPS gameplay (enabled by DLSS). In addition to being one of the few exclusive games to the new console, it's also very accessible, costing only $15. Check out the launch trailer above to see the game in action.</p><h3>Fast Fusion Update 1.3 Patch Notes</h3><ul><li>Added Carbium Cup with three new tracks.  <ul><li>Alpine Trust</li><li>Sunahara Plains</li><li>Zenshoh Habitat</li><li><em>These tracks are based on FAST RMX tracks but with all new graphics and changed track layouts to allow to be played perfectly with the new Hyperjump feature.</em></li></ul></li><li>New PURE rendering mode without any upscaling, rendering at 1440p docked, 1080p handheld (dynamic resolution).</li><li>New GPU particle system for snow.</li><li>Two new jukebox entries.</li><li>Easier progression (lower price for 3rd cup).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode.</li><li>Stability and performance improvements.</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/team-fortress-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3069">Team Fortress 2</a>'s Mann vs. Machine PvE mode is getting a "much-needed" update, according to developer Valve, and the studio is asking the game's community to help make content for it.</p><p dir="ltr">The mode, first released as part of a major update in 2012, sees players team up to defeat hordes of robots attempting to carry a bomb. Destroyed robots drop cash that can be used to purchase class upgrades. According to the <a href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_game_modes#Mann_vs._Machine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Team Fortress 2 wiki</a>, there are currently 29 missions and five operations (groups of missions played in sequence) for Mann vs. Machine.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, 13-years-later, Valve is looking to update Mann vs. Machine with the community's help. Valve, in the signature comedic style it always uses when writing about Team Fortress 2, is asking players to submit Mann vs. Machine maps and missions by August 27 for possible inclusion in the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Valve's tongue-in-cheek <a href="https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=247188" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> clarifies that the update, or at least a portion of it, will be arriving right before Halloween, but that the submitted maps do not need to all be Halloween-themed (though some of them could be, Valve later states).</p><p dir="ltr">"The king of the fictional land where this all happened (ancient Greece), decreed on stone tablets that even though the update was dropping right around the ancient Greek candy-harvest festival of Halloween, the maps did not need to all be Halloween-themed (first tablet) and in fact shouldn't be (second tablet)," Valve writes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Valve has asked for help to create new Team Fortress 2 content. The class-based FPS received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-gets-14-new-maps-as-part-of-major-summer-update/1100-6515934/" data-ref-id="1100-6515934">14 new community-made maps</a> as part of a major summer update in 2023. Valve earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2s-source-code-is-out-fan-made-games-may-be-next/1100-6529588/" data-ref-id="1100-6529588">released Team Fortress 2's entire source code</a>, giving the community the power to "change, extend, or rewrite TF2."</p><p dir="ltr">One of Team Fortress 2's most popular mods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-classic-coming-to-steam-this-year/1100-6529710/" data-ref-id="1100-6529710">Team Fortress 2 Classic</a>, is set to officially be released on Steam later this year. The mod returns the game to how it was in 2008, albeit with new weapons, modes, and quality-of-life features.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being nearly 20-years-old, Team Fortress 2 still has a strong following on Steam and is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-steam-games/2900-5335/" data-ref-id="2900-5335">best free games on Steam</a>. Over the past six months, the game has maintained anywhere from around 40,000 to 56,000 concurrent players, and actually reached a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-which-was-released-16-years-ago-just-broke-a-player-record/1100-6515946/" data-ref-id="1100-6515946">concurrent player peak of over 250,000</a> in 2023 following the release of the previously mentioned summer update.</p>
