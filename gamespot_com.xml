                <p dir="ltr">Firaxis is focused on quality-of-life improvements with Sid Meier's Civilization VII, resulting in a previously announced in-game event being pushed back to a future date. As such, it's not included alongside the new patch rolling out today, which brings UI improvements and the reintroduction of cross-play between PC and consoles to the strategy game.</p><p dir="ltr">Called Update 1.1.0, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" rel="nofollow ">the Civilization website</a> notes that the planned Natural Wonder Battle event has been "postponed to a later update." Instead, Firaxis is using this patch to address player feedback. That includes "UI adjustments," major alterations to "the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory," and a "balance pass on several Mementos." The Bermuda Triangle will also be a new discoverable natural wonder.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/">Civilization VII quality-of-life fixes have been targeted</a> by Firaxis even before the strategy game's full launch (there was an early-access release). Last month, the developer released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-civilization-7-patch-takes-aim-at-text-issues-and-war-hungry-ai-opponents/1100-6529386/">a patch that took aim at text issues and missing leader portraits</a>. Looking ahead, it's currently scheduled for Civilization VII to receive Update 1.1.1 on March 25, featuring further UI improvements as well as AI adjustments regarding scouting and settling.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review/1900-6418332/">Civilization VII review</a>.

                <p>Acclaim, an iconic game publisher from the 1990s behind series like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-jam/" data-ref-id="5000-2852">NBA Jam</a>, has been revived as an indie-game publisher.</p><p>Acclaim was founded in 1987 and made a name for itself in many ways. It was known for licensed games, ranging from NBA Jam to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/justice-league-task-force/" data-ref-id="5000-16280">Justice League Task Force</a>, being the console publisher for arcade classics like Mortal Kombat, and its wild marketing stunts promoting games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/turok-evolution/" data-ref-id="5000-4168">Turok: Evolution</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/shadow-man-2econd-coming/" data-ref-id="5000-3729">Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</a>. After several high-profile flops like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bmx-xxx/" data-ref-id="5000-4220">BMX XXX</a>, Acclaim filed for bankruptcy in 2004 and had been defunct--until now.</p><p>Companies like Striker Entertainment, Ridge Partners, Global Force Entertainment, VaynerFund, and JET Management have all come together to revive Acclaim as a game publisher that will "support indie developers and reignite classic franchises." It plans to provide funding, marketing, and PR support for any independent developers it works with. This new version of Acclaim is following in Atari's footsteps; Atari has also revitalized itself in recent years and reimagined classic titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-revisits-an-arcade-classic-with-breakout-beyond/1100-6529212/" data-ref-id="1100-6529212">Breakout</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-and-polybius-creator-are-reimagining-the-rare-arcade-game-i-robot/1100-6529425/" data-ref-id="1100-6529425">I, Robot.</a></p><p>It's unclear what specific franchises this new version of Acclaim has ownership over, as this initial announcement is more focused on confirming members of its new leadership team, like CEO Alex Jose. That also includes Jeff Jarrett, a Hall of Fame wrestler who worked with the old version of Acclaim on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwf-attitude/" data-ref-id="5000-2348">WWF titles</a>. "Resurrecting Acclaim is an opportunity to impart the same degree of passion and love to a new generation, and I'm excited to be involved," Jarrett said of the revival in a press release.</p><p>No new games were announced alongside this revival of Acclaim, although Josef teased that the company has "already signed some incredible titles, which we'll be revealing soon."</p>
