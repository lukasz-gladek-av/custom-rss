<section><p>Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties, and there’s no reason it should be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Over the course of its 26-year history, the Silent Hill series has built up a reputation for offering deep dives into the more psychological side of the survival horror genre and giving players complex stories and experiences that often resonate more deeply than those found in the genre’s action-focused contemporaries. This complexity, however, doesn't mean the series is without formula. By and large, this formula generally consists of taking a tortured or doubting protagonist, placing them in the titular town covered with fog, and allowing the monsters of their mind (or cults) to envelop them to help them discover or face their transgressions. It’s a setup that’s worked time and time again for Konami, and it’s what gamers have come to expect from the beloved series.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, I find that Silent Hill works best when it takes more risks with that established formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Take, for example, the premise of the fourth entry, Silent Hill 4: The Room. The game saw players take on the role of Henry Townshend, another "tortured or doubting protagonist" forced to confront their own internal distress. But while this part of the equation remained the same, gone was the titular town. Gone was the cult that played a large presence in the first and third entries. Gone was the series' trademark fog.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, Townshend spends the game trapped in a nightmarish version of his apartment--one that players are forced to thoroughly explore before being sent to a hellish landscape and undergoing a perspective shift. What The Room offered was a different take on the psychological horror story that, while similar to Silent Hill 2, brought with it new gameplay ideas that involved shifting perspectives and escort missions. It was taking expectations for a Silent Hill game and throwing them out the window in pursuit of new ideas that could move the series forward and redefine what a Silent Hill experience is.</p><p dir="ltr">Then all went quiet for a few years, and we got more traditional (and far less interesting) entries such as Silent Hill: Origins, Silent Hill: Homecoming, and Silent Hill Downpour. The series hadn’t fully stagnated just yet, but none of these entries felt like they were moving the series forward in any meaningful way. Instead, they felt like they were trying to mimic the aesthetics and story delivery of the original three games. They had the town of Silent Hill, tortured male protagonists and perspectives, and copious amounts of fog.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588693"></a><figcaption>A disturbing figure waits at the end of a hallway in this grainy still from P.T.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588693-2644397-5dfnrgv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Then in 2014, P.T. came along, and was seemingly the creative shot in the arm that Silent Hill needed. Directed by Hideo Kojima, P.T. had players traverse and down the same hallway over and over uncovering a story about family murder, discovering a bloody fetus in the bathroom sink, and encountering a ghastly creature named Lisa. Not long after its release, however, P.T. was revealed to be a small look at a cancelled game titled Silent Hills. Yet despite the teaser being both cryptic and cancelled, it arguably pushed Silent Hill into new, uncomfortable territory for the franchise, and provided players with a small taste of something that could never be.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, the series was dormant, without a mainline entry for over a decade.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2024, however, Konami resurrected Silent Hill, delivering a full remake of Silent Hill 2 that expanded on some elements from the original. But while this remake was well-made and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">critically-acclaimed</a>, it ultimately was treading territory that the series had seen before. It became clear that if we wanted something truly <em>new </em>from Silent Hill, we'd be waiting a bit longer. Fortunately, it didn't take long for Konami to deliver.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Silent Hill f spoilers to follow--read at your own discretion.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Enter Silent Hill f, which launched just this past month. The newest entry in the series, SHF takes Silent Hill out of the titular town and sets it instead in 1960s Japan. Its setting alone is a far cry from the Twin Peaks-esque view of middle America that the series is usually known for, trading hotels, diners, and record stores for schools, shrines, and awe-inspiring temples. The newest entry also adopts a “Silent Hill is a state of mind” approach, engulfing its small Japanese town setting in the trademark fog giving it the tension-filled sense of directionlessness. It feels familiar but strange all at once.</p><p dir="ltr">That feeling carries over to the narrative as well. Being set in 1960s Japan the game tackles topics of misogyny and the expectations for women at the time to be obedient housewives who must give up large parts of their identity in the pursuit of serving their husbands. Hinako is expected to marry a partner that’s preselected for her, taking away her free will and bodily autonomy. Whereas previous Silent Hill protagonists are psychologically tortured because of actions and choices they’ve made, Hinako is thrust into a situation she had no say in that drives her to near madness.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Silent Hill series has featured a female protagonist before, its feminist themes have never been quite this prominent. SHF and its various endings show the outcomes of not merely Hinako's "bad" choices, but all of the bad choices made for her. From being driven to murderous madness, drug addiction and acceptance, and even an ending in which she reclaims her free will to pursue a relationship naturally, Silent Hill f demonstrates how the series doesn't need to hone in on guilt, shame, and sin to pack a punch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4588694"></a><figcaption>Hinako kneels on bloodied ground in Silent Hill f.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4588694-4571359-silent-hill-f-is-back-with-a-trailer-and-brand-new-images-cover67d35b74a7d13.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to new themes, the game also dives into the more ethereal elements of the series by having segments set in the spirit world. While this is not a first for the series, Silent Hill f gives it a unique spin by spotlighting Japanese folklore, shrines, and temples, giving the entire experience a more eastern religious feeling. This is a far cry from the way religion has been depicted in past entries, which have traditionally leaned into cults and other satanic-inspired entities.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill is a horror game series where the possibilities are endless. And while Konami has a tried-and-true formula established that has carried the series throughout most of its life, Silent Hill truly shines when it takes risks with the established formula. Silent Hill has always been about overcoming psychological terrors in the face of real world anxieties and life expectations. There’s no reason it should always be beholden to a singular setting or formula.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has further detailed its plan to break apart or be sold. In a news release today, the media giant that owns the developers of Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter games said it has received "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties already to acquire the entirety of the company or just Warner Bros.</p><p>These parties were not named outright, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg recently reported</a> that Paramount submitted a $20/share bid for WBD, which the company rejected. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported</a> that Netflix and Comcast might be in the mix, too. Netflix already is invested in the gaming space and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">continues to ramp up its efforts</a> after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">some previous setbacks. </a></p><p>WBD said its board will "evaluate a broad range of strategic options" moving forward as it relates to the company's previously announced plan to sell the entire company or break it up in multiple sales or spin-offs.</p><p>CEO David Zaslav said he's trying to find a buyer or multiple buyers to help "unlock the full value of our assets." WBD board of directors chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. added, "We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value," but that it's important as well to "broaden" the scope of potential transactions to find a deal that pays the company the most possible money for its assets.</p><p>WBD did not set a deadline or a timetable for when it will complete this newest strategic review for these "strategic alternatives" to the previously announced separation plan. That plan, meanwhile, is booked to be completed by mid-2026, if it happens at all.</p><p>Also today, WBD announced <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-max-prices-increases-plans-2025-1236557671/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another price hike for HBO Max, and it's the third in three years.</a> WBD's stock price is soaring today, up more than 10% so far.</p><p>As for WBD's gaming efforts, the company has said it will focus on core franchises going forward with the highest potential of making money back. Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285"> full sequel</a> to Hogwarts Legacy. The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.</p><p>One we do know about is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-691445">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which launches in 2026 from developer Traveller's Tales. As for the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is coming October 30, but it's published by Atari, not Warner Bros. A project that is not coming to market is Wonder Woman, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">WBD canceled the game and closed the studio, Monolith.</a> The company also closed Player First Games and WB San Diego earlier this year.</p><p>WBD management said the breakout success of Hogwarts Legacy gives the company the confidence that it can "get back to producing high-quality games built for long-term consumer engagement." The company said it expects its video game division to return to profitability in 2025 with the games division looking to become a "more significant contributor to growth in the years ahead."</p><p>WB's longtime gaming boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he is leaving the company but will stay on for the time being to help with the transition process.</p>

                <p>Lovecraftian survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/">The Sinking City 2</a> has been delayed to 2026, as Frogwares says that the ongoing war in Ukraine and its ambitious design goals for the sequel will have necessitated more development time. While a concrete release date hasn't been set yet, the studio says it is aiming to have the game out in the first half of 2026.</p><p>"Developing a game during a war isn’t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning."</p><p>Lead game designer Alexander Gresko also added that The Sinking City's 2 shift toward a full-fledged survival-horror direction has also slowed the team down, as it has to learn a "completely different kind of design thinking" for the game. To make up for the delay, the studio revealed 13 new screenshots for The Sinking City 2, showing off more of the game's setting and enemies that players will encounter. Frogwares also plans to reveal a fresh look at the game soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

                <p>A new report has shed light on Electronic Arts' use of AI, revealing a company that's implementing the technology in everything from game development to performance reviews. EA's position? Employees should view AI as a "thought partner."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report from Business Insider</a>, EA's top brass over the past year has urged its nearly 15,000 workers to use AI for everything from coding and concept art to scripting conversations around performance reviews and promotions. Internal documents Business Insider obtained showed some workers are not just expected to take multiple AI training courses, but also use AI daily to expedite work, with the idea that the tech is a "thought partner."</p><p>The company's in-house chatbot, ReefGPT, is one of the tools EA is pushing onto its workers. However, people Business Insider spoke to on the condition of anonymity said this chatbot produces flawed code and other hallucinations, creating more work that clogs production. Other people Business Insider spoke to said EA is expecting creative staff to train AI on their work, instilling a fear that the company may then facilitate a downsizing that could cut talent such as artists and level designers.</p><p>A laid-off Respawn Entertainment senior quality-assurance designer told Business Insider that AI basically did his job--reviewing and summarizing playtesters' feedback--which is why he believes he was cut from EA this spring, along with nearly 100 others.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">EA warned of "legal and reputational" risks</a> around the industry's mass adoption of AI, saying consumers could "lose confidence in our business and brands" if the technology isn't managed appropriately.</p><p>The company was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased (pending regulatory approval) by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">one of the largest sales in the business sector</a> that--much like EA's AI use--raises some ethical questions.</p>
