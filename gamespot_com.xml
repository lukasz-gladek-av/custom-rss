                <p>More news about Star Wars Eclipse could be on the way, but it has at least been confirmed to make a showing at an event in 2027 2027, with its official Twitter account confirming an appearance at a future event.</p><p><span>The Star Wars Eclipse </span><a href="https://x.com/StarWarEclipse/status/1914063551834034237" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Twitter account said</a><span>, "Hey there, it's been a while," as its first post, fueling speculation that there could be some sort of grand reveal soon. It then followed up saying to sign up at the game's </span><a href="https://www.starwarseclipse.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a><span> to keep up with updates.</span></p><p>With the 2025 Star Wars Celebration event wrapped up this past weekend in Japan, it was confirmed that the next one will be held in Los Angeles from April 1-4, 2027. The Star Wars Eclipse account <a href="https://x.com/StarWarEclipse/status/1914104221571649561" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that the game will make an appearance there.</p><p>Right now, Star Wars Eclipse is reportedly targeting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-shooting-for-2026-launch-report/1100-6515546/" data-ref-id="1100-6515546">late 2026 release window</a>. It's unclear whether the game has been delayed internally, as it seemingly wouldn't make sense for the game to show at a 2027 event after already launching. Star Wars Eclipse developer Quantic Dream became <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantic-dream-ends-25-years-of-independence-sells-itself-to-netease/1100-6507008/" data-ref-id="1100-6507008">a subsidiary of NetEase</a> in 2022, and the latter company had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">major shakeup earlier this year</a>.

Star Wars Eclipse will be similar and feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-eclipse-will-feature-the-fundamental-elements-of-a-quantic-dream-game/1100-6507588/" data-ref-id="1100-6507588">strong stories, action, and multiple choices.</a></p>

                <p>Amid a flurry of leaks and rumors, Bethesda has now announced that it will make some kind of announcement on April 22 pertaining to "IV." Combined with an image of a character with a shielded face, many are taking this to be a reference to the heavily rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster. This seems like a pretty safe bet, especially considering images and details about an apparent Oblivion remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-info-and-screens-leak-apparently-releasing-next-week/1100-6530870/" data-ref-id="1100-6530870">recently leaked on developer Virtuos' website.</a></p><p>Whatever it is, we'll find out on April 22 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET.</p><p>A remake of Oblivion has been rumored for years, dating back to when it was first mentioned in the court documents that came out of the FTC vs. Microsoft case. It was initially rumored that an Oblivion remaster could have a shadowdrop on April 21, but that's apparently not going to happen.</p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

                <p>EA Sports has announced a partnership with the legendary band Metallica. The "For Whom The Band Tolls Competition," as it's called, will see EA Sports and Metallica come together to give one collegiate marching band the chance to record the CFB theme song and a Metallica song for a future CFB title.</p><p>The existence of this competition is pretty much all we know so far. The announcement stated that the winning marching band will get to record a Metallica song for a future version of CFB, and given that this is only just being announced in late April, it would seem the song wouldn't be ready until the inevitable CFB 27 in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">CFB + Metallica = The Ultimate Marching Band Competition!<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EASPORTSCollege</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Metallica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Metallica</a> are joining forces to give one college marching band an opportunity to take the field and get in the game: The Division 1 winner of the For Whom the Band Tolls! competition will not only… <a href="https://t.co/WPzVwawFmb" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WPzVwawFmb</a></p>  — EASPORTSCollege (@EASPORTSCollege) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For CFB 25, EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-sights-and-sounds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Torsten Staley recorded every team's fight song</a> in Nashville with a group of musicians made up of students and alumni from schools like Oklahoma, North Texas, Vanderbilt, USC, Auburn, and Tennessee. The CFB theme song was also recorded in Nashville with a house band--check out a recording below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_8BD_3ZN4KI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_8BD_3ZN4KI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For what it's worth, CFB 26 hasn't even been officially announced yet, though EA has said fans can expect another entry this year. EA is paying student-athletes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-will-pay-student-athletes-1500-to-appear-in-cfb-26-more-that-double-last-years-rate/1100-6530192/" data-ref-id="1100-6530192">at least $1,500 to appear in the game this year</a>, which is more than double last year's rate.

EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p><p>CFB 25 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 2 best-selling game overall in the US</a>, trailing only Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
