                <p dir="ltr">Agent 47 has met several famous faces--and even killed a few of them--throughout his journey in the World of Assassination, but for his next mission, he'll be taking on one of the greatest rap artists of all time: Slim Shady. To be specific, the new Elusive Target mission coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-3/">Hitman</a> will see Agent 47 tasked with killing Eminem's younger alter-ego by none other than Eminem himself. We promise we're not making this up.</p><p dir="ltr">Thanks to Slim Shady being a separate--and violent--entity, the real Eminem is fearful that his creation will eventually come for him. It's up to Agent 47 to step in and take down Slim Shady so that the real Eminem can keep on rapping till he collapses.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qk6wSOEqMHU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qk6wSOEqMHU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>If you're new to them, Elusive Targets are one of the more interesting challenges in Hitman. Your targets don't show up as a red glow when you use 47's instincts to search for them, as you'll have to rely on intel and surveillance to keep track of your mark. You usually get one shot to take down an Elusive Target--as bungling a mission does have consequences--but IO has brought several of these popular contracts back in the past.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bruce-lee-enters-the-world-of-assassination-in-new-hitman-level/1100-6535009/">The last Elusive Target mission saw 47 team up with late martial-arts legend Bruce Lee</a> to take down a shadowy syndicate, and this new mission will go live in Hitman: World of Assassination soon.</p><p>IO Interactive's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/">007: First Light</a>, will be released in March 2026. As its release date draws closer, the studio has been sharing more details on the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-some-of-the-biggest-levels-that-hitman-dev-has-ever-built/1100-6534477/">its world</a>, and how it has crafted an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-will-star-patrick-gibson-as-legendary-super-spy/1100-6534458/">original James Bond story</a> that shows how the rookie MI6 earns his 00 status. A new trailer for the game debuted during the Xbox Partner Preview Showcase, and it showed off the new state-of-the-art Aston Martin Valhalla that Bond will use in his travels.</p>

                <p>Anyone planning to get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on Switch 2 will likely have to do some housekeeping in their system storage settings--the Square Enix release will take up 90 to 99 GB, depending on the edition.</p><p>Square Enix confirmed the numbers on social media, clarifying that the standard edition is 90 to 95 GB, while the Limited Early Purchase Edition, which includes a port of the original Final Fantasy VII game, is a hefty 93.8 to 99 GB.</p><p>The Switch 2's default internal storage is 256 GB, meaning that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade would use between 35-40% of a console's space. For comparison, the game takes up around 81 GB on PlayStation 5, slightly less than the Switch 2 version.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Correction to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade storage requirements on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p> Standard Edition: 90GB to 95GB<br>Limited Early Purchase Edition and Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Editions: 93.8GB to 99GB.</p><p> The My Nintendo pages will be updated soon.</p></div>  — FINAL FANTASY VII (@finalfantasyvii) <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1991431395873530291?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It's a larger game than other sizeable third-party offerings on Switch 2, such as Apex Legends (78.5 GB), Split Fiction (73 GB), and Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition (59 GB).</p><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will also be on a Game Key Card, meaning that Switch 2 owners who purchase the game will have no choice but to install the full title, regardless of whether they bought it digitally or physically.</p><p>Reportedly, the only game card options that developers can choose are <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-23/nintendo-s-switch-2-sales-boom-fails-to-ease-game-developers-gloom" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Key Cards or 64 GB cards</a>, with no options for smaller or larger-sized cards. If true, that means that Square Enix couldn't fit Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade on a bitter-tasting Switch 2 cartridge even if it wanted to.</p><p>Other than installing other games, the best option for Switch 2 owners looking to play Remake Intergrade is probably to invest in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-lexar/1100-6530578/" data-ref-id="1100-6530578">microSD Express Card and expand their storage</a>.
