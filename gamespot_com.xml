                <p>Seasoned Mario Kart players know to drift often to build up boosts and get some extra speed coming around corners. With charge jumps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> seemed to add yet another technique to get some marginal gains and edge out opponents--but the story isn't that simple.</p><p>Charge jumps, which are essentially drifts done on straightaways instead of corners, come with all the same visual indicators of granting a speed boost as classic drifting, but it turns out that the technique may technically slow you down. Following intensive investigation from the Mario Kart community, fans have seemingly confirmed that normal acceleration on a straight is preferable to charge-jumping.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwKJiP4r-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EmwKJiP4r-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user Karting All Day comprehensively explored the differences in speed between charge-jumping and normal racing in the video embedded above. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-charge-jump-speed-boost-too-slow-1851785905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> also independently confirmed the results across different top-speed builds.</p><p>So what, then, is the point of Nintendo even adding this capability to the game? There are a few reasons why charge-jumping can still be useful. In general, they're a way to gain access to certain things; a quick charge jump can get you up to the requisite height to grab a grind rail, and they can also help start wall rides.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched alongside the Switch 2 last month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">a commercial success</a>. Its tweaks and additions to the Mario Kart formula have inspired a wealth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tips-and-tricks-to-help-you-cross-the-finish-line/2900-6670/" data-ref-id="2900-6670">tips, tricks</a>, and investigations, including one detailing how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-coins-dont-function-as-youd-expect-new-evidence-suggests/1100-6532471/" data-ref-id="1100-6532471">coins work slightly differently than you'd expect</a>.</p>

Ahead of that release, Bungie has made the past three years' worth of Destiny 2 content available to anyone, absolutely free.</p><p>Starting with 2022's The Witch Queen, you can now dive into the story of Savathun, explore the villain arc of The Witness in Lightfall, and watch it all come to a conclusion in The Final Shape until July 22. That gives you a few weeks to blast through the main story content of each of the expansions before diving into The Edge of Fate to find out what comes next.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge Of Fate Might Revitalize My Interest</p>
      </div>
<p>Alongside the expansions, Bungie has also given open access to all players to the Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy Episodes. These Episodes follow the events of The Final Shape, setting up the story for the new expansion as well as tying up a few loose ends left behind. These Episodes are only available until the release of The Edge of Fate, meaning they'll be unavailable after July 15.</p><p>However, all rewards, Titles, Triumphs, and cosmetics earned as part of those Episodes will remain on your account after the open access ends.</p><p>The Final Shape marked the conclusion of a decade-old saga, but The Edge of Fate starts a new story, with new enemies, and a fresh location to explore in the form of the planet Kepler. This time around, we'll be dealing with The Nine--a strange alien lifeforce which no one really understands. There'll be plenty of mysteries and secrets to uncover, and you can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">sequence break</a> the game in order to unravel them all, which Bungie says is intentional.</p><p>There are plenty of new additions coming with The Edge of Fate, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-livestream-all-the-new-exotics-weapons-and-artifact-mods/2900-6699/" data-ref-id="2900-6699">new weapons</a>, a complete overhaul of the gear system, and a new location to explore with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-kepler-destination-has-a-limited-time-activity-thatll-give-you-new-exotics/1100-6532892/" data-ref-id="1100-6532892">time-limited activity </a>never seen before. Alongside this, all players will have their power level reset to 200, meaning you'll no longer be horribly overleveled compared to your newcomer friends. That does come with the caveat that you might have to work a little harder to be ready for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid </a>race. If you're waiting for the perfect moment to force your unwilling friends into the sprawling space shooter, it might just be right now.</p>

                <p>Owlcat Games' The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a space-set third-person action-RPG based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sci-fi-fans-can-save-big-on-the-expanse-complete-series-on-blu-ray-at-amazon/1100-6520164/" data-ref-id="1100-6520164">The Expanse TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-james-sa-corey-captives-war-trilogy-amazon-prime-deal/1100-6525559/" data-ref-id="1100-6525559">the novels by James S. A. Corey</a> (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). When the trailer debuted earlier this summer, the comparisons to Mass Effect were almost immediate. Alexander Mishulin--the game's creative director--recently acknowledged that Mass Effect influenced the development of Osiris Reborn. But the team plans to go in its own direction rather than simply copying Mass Effects' approach.</p><p>"It's different [from Mass Effect] in many ways," Mishulin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "First of all, we make our story a little bit differently. We're making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency."</p><p>As an example, Mishulin noted that players won't be locked into character paths like paragon or renegade. The player can decide whether their characters come from Earth, Mars, or the Belt. That choice will affect how NPC and companion characters react and relate to them during the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQifuOTTe8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's story is set during the first two and a half seasons of The Expanse, and the player's character will be the captain of the most advanced ship in the galaxy. Regardless of the player's choices, the captain is also a twin, and both siblings are on board the ship. However, the twins may not always see eye-to-eye about the best course of action.</p><p>While there will be multiple romance options on the ship, Mishulin noted that Osiris Reborn will feature "a lot more convenient user interfaces [and] convenient approaches to the gameplay," rather than trying to replicate Mass Effects' gameplay.</p><p>Owlcat Games hasn't set a date for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn yet, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The studio is also currently developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

                <p>This week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 3 will launch by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">adding Jean Grey aka Phoenix to the lineup</a>, with Blade slated to arrive soon after. And while the new season is arriving in close proximity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">the FF were already added to the game</a> earlier this year. In the future, NetEase has plans to incorporate more content from the MCU and comics, while also ensuring that it doesn't interfere with the game's pre-planned storylines.</p><p>Marvel Rivals progression systems game director Guangyun Chen recently told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-lead-confirms-future-content-createdsystemic-manner-mcu-comics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a> that the game is "driven by its own universe and seasonal storylines" and that the seasons are planned out far ahead of time. He went on to explain that the dev team is developing new seasons in "a systemic manner" while also keeping an eye out for fresh additions from the films and comics.</p><p>"We are closely monitoring the release schedules of comics and movies, and we will incorporate relevant content when appropriate," said Chen. "However, this will not disrupt our own content development timeline."</p><p>After The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the next Marvel movie to hit theaters will be Spider-Man: Brand New Day on July 13, 2026. That seems far enough ahead to incorporate some Spidey-related characters, but it's also possible that NetEase may pull content from some of Marvel's TV shows on Disney+. Daredevil, for example, seems like he'd be a good fit for the game. NetEase also recently disclosed that it has the rights to include any character from the past eight decades of Marvel comics.</p><p>Season 3 of Marvel Rivals will begin on July 11.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Smelting is a crucial part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> survival. This is how you cook food, make ore ingots, and produce other resources. In this guide, we'll discuss all the different types of furnaces, fuels, and explain how smelting works in Minecraft.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_smelting_works_in_Minecraft">How smelting works in Minecraft</a></li><li><a href="#Minecraft_furnace_types">Minecraft furnace types</a><ul><li><a href="#Furnace">Furnace</a></li><li><a href="#Blast_Furnace">Blast Furnace</a></li><li><a href="#Smoker">Smoker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Campfires">Campfires</a></li><li><a href="#Smelting_fuel_types">Smelting fuel types</a></li><li><a href="#Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_smelting_works_in_Minecraft">How smelting works in Minecraft</h2><p dir="ltr">Smelting in Minecraft allows you to place a material and fuel into a furnace in order to cook food, make ore ingots, turn sand into glass, refine stones, and more. To smelt, you first need to build a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Minecraft_furnace_types">Minecraft furnace types</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three different types of smelters you can build in Minecraft.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291" data-ratio="0.56222639149468" data-width="1599" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291"></a><figcaption>Smelting with furnaces in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Furnace">Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the first smelter you'll have the resources to craft. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-furnace-in-minecraft/1100-6526071/">standard furnace</a> works for all types of resources you can smelt, such as food, ore, and sand. You can even smelt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-terracotta-in-minecraft/1100-6525032/">terracotta</a> to create colorful glazed blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">This furnace only requires eight pieces of cobblestone to build. You can also quickly craft one in the Nether by using Blackstone.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Blast_Furnace">Blast Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">The blast furnace provides a speedier way to smelt ore types, but it doesn't work for food or other materials. To build, it requires five iron ingots, three pieces of smooth stone, and a regular furnace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Smoker">Smoker</h3><p dir="ltr">The smoker is exclusively built for cooking food, and this will cook faster than the furnace. The build requires four wood logs and a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Campfires">Campfires</h2><p dir="ltr">While these don't look like the other furnace types, it's worth mentioning you can also cook food on campfires. The campfires are lit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-minecraft-flint/1100-6533030/" data-ref-id="1100-6533030">flint and steel</a>, and these can cook four pieces of food at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To build a standard campfire, you'll need three logs, three sticks, and one piece of coal. For the soul campfire, you'll need three logs, three sticks, and one piece of soul sand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528290" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528290"></a><figcaption>Cooking chicken in the smoker with coal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Smelting_fuel_types">Smelting fuel types</h2><p dir="ltr">Coal and charcoal are probably the most commonly used resources for fuel, but there are several other items in the game that can be used as fuel for smelting. Here we'll list several resources you can use as fuel, including efficient sources and the less recommended options.</p><p dir="ltr">The most efficient fuel sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lava bucket: Can smelt 100 items</li><li dir="ltr">Coal block: Can smelt 80 items</li><li dir="ltr">Dried Kelp block: Can smelt 20 items</li><li dir="ltr">Blaze Rod: Can smelt 12 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of coal: Can smelt 8 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of charcoal: Can smelt 8 items</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Resource-wise, stacks of coal will be one of the easiest and most efficient fuel sources, especially early in your game. Lava Buckets will be best suited for when you're trying to smelt large qualities of ore.</p><p dir="ltr">Less efficient fuels sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wood logs, planks, fence pieces, wood crafting tables, bookshelves, and more will smelt 1.5 items each</li><li dir="ltr">Wooden tools, signs, and wooden doors will smelt 1 item each</li><li dir="ltr">Then you have other normal items that will smelt less than 1 item each, including wool blocks, carpet, seeds, and bamboo</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These normal items aren't efficient to use as fuel, but in a pinch, you can throw these in your furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</h2><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that smelting contributes to your experience points. You gain valuable XP every time you retrieve smelted items from the furnaces.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also Minecraft achievements tied to smelting various items, including cooking your first cake and bread.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that your furnaces are up and running, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.</p>
