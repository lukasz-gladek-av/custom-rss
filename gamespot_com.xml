                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off the game's next-level visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. According the game's director, Aoba Miyazaki, one of the highlights of My Hero Academia: All's Justice is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A. From this roster, players will assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing them to chain together attacks and quirk abilities. A new Rising system will also players to "significantly boost" the power of their characters by unleashing "their full potential," though the studio did not specify exactly what that might entail.</p><p>However, Bandai Namco did confirm it will be sharing more about My Hero Academia: All's Justice in the near future. For the time being, players can wishlist the upcoming title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p><p>The announcement of My Hero Academia: All's Justice comes more than five years after the last My Hero Fighting Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">One's Justice 2</a>, was released back in March 2020. One's Justice 2 was considered a significant step up from its predecessor, One's Justice, but failed to garner the sort of praise reserved for Bandai Namco's Naruto fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm/" data-ref-id="5000-33192">Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>, or its Dragon Ball fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz/" data-ref-id="5000-465487">FighterZ</a>.</p>

Separately, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that "every game" on display at the event in June is "continuing on."</p><p>In terms of games that are not going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild </a>and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">new Perfect Dark have been canceled</a>--neither appeared at the Showcase, fueling theories about what that could mean.

We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>Going forward, Booty claimed Xbox's portfolio strategy is "unchanged," and that is to make great games filled with "new stories, worlds, and characters." He specified that Microsoft has 40+ games in "active development" and teased a "strong slate" for 2026 that will include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">new Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, the next Forza game, and a possible Halo release.</a></p><p>Microsoft's cuts to Xbox came as part of a wider cost-cutting program that saw the technology giant lay off about 4% of its global workforce, amounting to around 9,000 people.</p>

That’s the same price you’d pay if you picked up the discounted Spider-Man Stand and an Echo Dot (5th Gen), making it a good choice if you don’t yet have the smart speaker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png" data-ref-id="1300-4525227" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png" data-ref-id="1300-4525227"></a><figcaption>Amazon Echo Dot with Iron Man Stand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png"></figure><p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot</a>, the standalone speaker is available for $32 (was $50), though you can also find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Amazon-Basics-Smart-Color/dp/B0DGRFBFP2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundled with an Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb</a> for $37 (was $63). Consider spending the extra few bucks on this option, as you’ll be able to control the bulb via voice commands with your new smart speaker.

This smart speaker is now just $22 (was $40), and while it doesn't sound quite as robust as the Echo Dot, it's a good choice for small spaces that don't need the 360-degree soundscape provided by the Dot. This is the best price we've seen in 2025, and it's not likely to stick around past Prime Day.

It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness.</p><p>It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for $6</a> right now.</p><p>The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In- terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</p><p>One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs.</p><p>While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">For a higher-end 4K player with built-in streaming and voice assistant capabilities, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Panasonic DP-UB820-K</a>.

Data miners have now discovered a potential American Dad crossover in the new game files, meaning more cartoon skins could be on the way.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1940463346744283411" rel="nofollow ">Data miners have leaked</a> Call of Duty bundles for both Stan and Roger from Seth MacFarlane's American Dad animated sitcom. These leaks also suggest a price of 2,800 CoD Points ($25) for each bundle, which is typical for the pricing on most bundles for Call of Duty's big IP crossovers.</p><p dir="ltr">It's uncertain when this American Dad collaboration might arrive. If this content is indeed still planned for Call of Duty, it's possible it might arrive with Season 4 Reloaded to continue the cartoon theme, or this could be planned for a later crossover event in Season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-beavis-and-butt-head-event-all-weapons-skins-and-all-rewards/2900-6729/" data-ref-id="2900-6729">Beavis and Butt-Head event</a> is live from now until July 30, and there are free and premium rewards available to unlock. This includes two free DLC weapons, free skins for Todd and Coach Buzzcut, and paid skins for both Beavis and Butt-Head.</p><p>In addition to Beavis and Butt-Head, Season 4 Reloaded adds cel-shaded maps, new game modes, and more. Check out the gallery below to see everything new in Season 4 Reloaded. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Season 4 Reloaded patch notes</a> detail major weapon attachment changes, updates to Zombies Grief mode, and a wacky new Warzone mode.</p>
