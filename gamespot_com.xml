                <p>In 2020, Just Cause creator and Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg started a new company, Liquid Swords, alongside other industry veterans. Now, the team at Liquid Swords has shared the first trailer for its debut action title, Samson: A Tyndalston Story. It may remind some fans of Grand Theft Auto, but there are differences that make it a lot harder to earn money in this game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ4z_yQE5Xo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tyndalston is the name of the city, and players will step into the role of Samson McCray, an aging criminal who is facing a crushing debt. Players can steal the money they need, but this isn't like other open-world crime games where you can keep going non-stop. Samson has physical limits as to what he can pull off in a day, which are measured by action points. Use too many on a single job and you won't be able to do much else.</p><p>As time passes in this world, your debt increases. For every crime you commit, the city remembers and your reputation grows. According to Liquid Swords, "There are no do-overs. You move forward because standing still makes everything worse." This is a story about debt, consequences, and survival. Samson will have to deal with all three on a daily basis.</p><p>"We built Samson to strike fast and leave a mark," said Sundberg in a statement. "It's a raw, physical story with systems that push back at every turn. This is the start of what Liquid Swords stands for, and the team has delivered something with real teeth. We've come through a heavy cycle of change and sharpened every part of how we work. The entire industry is navigating pressure right now. Samson is our answer to that reality, a focused project built with intent, not excess. This is how we move forward."</p><p>Samson: A Tyndalston Story will be released on PC in early 2026 on Steam and the Epic Games Store.</p>

This includes defensive perks that will help keep you alive, and an offensive perk designed for intel and aggressive plays.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Survivor</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This was already a helpful pick in recent seasons of Warzone, but it becomes even more powerful in this new year with BO7's integration. In addition to the health regen and faster revives, it also now protects you from getting one-hit by snipers so long as you're geared up with full plates.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tracker</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Tracker is the pick for aggressive players looking to hunt their opponents. This will let you track and ping enemies just as before, but now the perk gives the added benefit of also letting your teammates see the enemy footprints after you shoot an enemy. Put some bullets in your opponent, but they are trying to flee? Now, you and your team can work together to track their steps and hunt them down.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It's always helpful to have a Ghost class in Warzone, but the perk is very situational. There are some matches where your opponents just aren't calling in a lot of UAVs, and it might be better to have Tracker or Survivor as your third perk. Make at least one Ghost class, and this is something you can switch to if you find there are a lot of UAVs getting activated, or to keep you off the radar in a late-game situation.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Adaptive</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a brand-new perk that the developer says is designed to allow you to dynamically respond to combat situations. When your armor plates are full, it supports aggressive pushes. When plates are depleted, it grants a constant movement advantage to aid you in repositioning.</p><p dir="ltr">This perk could be really useful in various situations, but it will require some testing to see if the ADS and speed boosts are enough to make this a viable pick, but it's worth trying out to see if you find this beneficial to you.</p>
