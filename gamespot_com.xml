                <p>Rematch, a flashy new competitive soccer game from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a> developer Sloclap, is a big hit, reaching over 1 million players in its first day. That number includes those who bought the game and checked it out through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>Sloclap shared the news on X Friday morning while also promising to continue improving and fixing the game. If you looked at publicly available player count data, though, this wouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">One million unique players in 24 hours. Seeing so many of you jump into Rematch on day one is incredible.ü´∂<br>The whole team is super grateful! And already hard at work on fixing and improving the game.<br>We are just getting started.‚öΩÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/87i3Wz4kQZ" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/87i3Wz4kQZ</a></p>  ‚Äî Rematch (@PlayRematch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1936061475447013553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rematch's data on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2138720/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> showed that 92,841 people were playing Rematch concurrently on Steam alone on June 19. As I write this, over 54,000 people are playing Rematch on Steam. That's a strong start for the launch window of a new multiplayer game. Comparitively, Remedy Entertainment's recently released co-op shooter FBC: Firebreak only peaked at 1,992 concurrent players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The 1 million player count confirmation gives us an even better idea of just how many people are checking Rematch out across Steam, Game Pass, and PS5. Players seem to be generally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-online-5v5-soccer-game-had-me-sweating-from-the-pressure/1100-6530784/" data-ref-id="1100-6530784">enjoying their time with Rematch</a> as well. It currently has a Mostly Positive rating <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2138720/REMATCH/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a> with over 7,000 user reviews, and an aggregate score of 76 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/rematch/critic-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>.</p><p>As far as multiplayer games go, Rematch is relatively simple: It's a 5v5 competitive soccer game that trades the simulation gameplay of EA Sports FC for flashier, arcade-inspired soccer action. Sloclap's animation prowess from Sifu is also on full display here, which makes Rematch an enjoyable game to watch and play. Considering how popular soccer is around the world, it's not too surprising that a refreshing and fun take on the soccer game formula like Rematch is finding success.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a> is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It is part of the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate game catalog, but can also be purchased for $30.</p>

                <p>In early 2023, Wizards of the Coast canceled at least <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">five video games that were in development</a>, including an unfinished Dungeons &amp; Dragons open-world action RPG by Hidden Path Entertainment. Now, nearly eight minutes of footage from that game have been leaked online, and while the title was far from finished, it shows real promise.</p><p>The footage originated from one of the music supervisors of the game (via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/look-into-dungeons-dragons-cancelled-open-world-rpg-project-dante-gameplay-concept-art" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>), which was known internally as Project Dante. Given the source of the video, it shouldn't be surprising that it puts a spotlight on some of the game's music. The video notes that the score was composed to seamlessly flow from the open-world theme to more specific tracks, including an ethereal theme for a temple and more forbidding notes as the heroes approached a Troll cave. A band of bards even performs an entire song while the main characters listen.</p><p>Project Dante's world looks enticing even in this early state, but the combat was clearly a work-in-progress at the time that this footage was made. There's enough here to see that this game had real potential, but it's never going to officially see the light of day. Some Project Dante's concept art has also been shared on <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZCdr9WI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Imgur</a> as another glimpse of what could have been.</p><p>Earlier this year, Wizards of the Coast announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/" data-ref-id="1100-6531973">a new single-player D&amp;D game</a> in development by Giant Skull, a studio founded by Respawn veteran Stig Asmussen.

Wizards of the Coast has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games</a> are in development.</p>

                <p>Following a recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> previews, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has confirmed that one fan-requested feature will be in the game when it launches in September. While a mini-map won't be in the looter-shooter, a radar will, making situational awareness of a battlefield much easier.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1935803698976022970" rel="nofollow ">In a lengthy thread</a>, Pitchford spoke about how fans had been asking Gearbox to add this feature to the game--many people from the European, US, and Asian preview tours were advocating for it, Pitchford said--and the studio managed to make this happen.</p><p>"As me and head of dev, Steve Jones--and some of the other guys--were poking around with producers trying to figure out what it would take to add these features and if we could make it in time to ship or not, something awesome happened," Pitchford explained. "In classic Gearbox style, where we have an ethos of 'they who builds it, wins,' some developers got together and found some time in the margins of their schedules. Some Gearbox heroes did what Gearbox heroes do!"</p><p>Several Gearbox employees "splintered off" to work on the radar, and Pitchford says they managed to squeeze it into the game before it undergoes some QA testing ahead of its launch. The radar will be off by default when the game launches, and it won't be in the current build of Borderlands 4 on the Borderlands Fan Fest showfloor this weekend. Here's what it looks like in action:</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">Borderlands 4 will also have a few other fan-requested features when it launches</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-is-happy-the-game-is-not-80-and-has-no-paid-early-access/1100-6532526/">base version of the game has an MSRP of $70</a>. "This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes," Jordan Ram√©e said in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Borderlands 4 preview</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with a Switch 2 version arriving at a later date.</p>
