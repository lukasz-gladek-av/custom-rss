                <p>Nintendo's original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing/" data-ref-id="5000-3602">Animal Crossing</a> on GameCube helped pave the way for many of the cozy games players have today. The cute animal villagers largely enjoy a blissful experience, but a new AI hack has the town feeling that Tom Nook--the raccoon who basically controls the local economy based on bells as currency--is a tyrant who needs to go down.</p><p>Software engineer <a href="https://joshfonseca.com/blogs/animal-crossing-llm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Josh Fonseca</a> created this Animal Crossing hack (via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/animal-crossing-mod-uses-ai-to-orchestrate-anti-tom-nook-villager-revolt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>), and he explained at length how he pulled it off in the accompanying YouTube video. The GameCube software wasn't really designed to hacked like this, but Fonseca was eventually able to find his way in and give Animal Crossing some commands that could be understood by the game's code.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AyEzA5ziE0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1115">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7AyEzA5ziE0?start=1115" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fonseca initially tried to use a single live language model AI to write new dialogue for the characters, while also drawing their character traits from online wikis. According to Fonseca, that approach failed because he was asking the AI to do too much. In the end, he set aside one AI program to handle the dialogue, while another program essentially directed its in-game presentation.</p><p>Once this was done, Fonseca introduced some modern elements to the game including news about current events. He also cheekily instructed the AI to depict resentment towards Tom Nook, which grows into unrest among the villagers over time. There's no endgame conclusion where the villagers confront Tom, but it is a very funny turn for these gentle creatures.</p><p>Former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan recently shared that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-almost-had-a-better-title-in-the-west-but-nintendo-rejected-it/1100-6534576/" data-ref-id="1100-6534576">Animal Crossing almost had another name</a> that was ultimately rejected. The most recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, was released in 2020. That game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">received a Switch 2 update</a> earlier this year. Although there aren't any new titles in the franchise at the moment, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs</a> that are available for order.</p>

                <p>One of this year's biggest hits is Hazelight Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>, the two-player co-op sci-fi/fantasy adventure that has sold over 4 million copies since its release in March 2025. Now, Hazelight Studios has shared the news of a rare honor in its home country of Sweden, as Split Fiction has become the first video game to ever receive the Excellent Swedish Design award.</p><p>On Hazelight Studios' social media accounts, the company posted a picture of studio founder and Split Fiction director Josef Fares alongside Sweden's Prince Carl Philip, who presented the award.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1968341212399820878" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Swedish royalty (left) and his buddy (right) üòè<br>But seriously - the prince of Sweden, his majesty Carl Philip, just awarded Split Fiction the prestigious Excellent Swedish Design award. <br>We‚Äôre thankful to be the first videogame to ever receive it! üëëüá∏üá™ <a href="https://t.co/9xT5KvOJDj" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9xT5KvOJDj</a></p>  ‚Äî Hazelight Studios (@HazelightGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/1968341212399820878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">co-op game</a> follows two young writers, Mio Hudson (Kaja Chan) and Zoe Foster (Elsie Bennett), who find themselves trapped in a simulation of their stories. Mio and Zoe are forced to work together as their fictional worlds bleed into each other. Split Fiction was the follow up to Hazelight Studios' other successful co-op title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/it-takes-two/" data-ref-id="5000-514264">It Takes Two</a>, which sold 23 million copies.</p><p>There's already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/split-fiction-is-getting-a-movie-adaptation-just-like-it-takes-two/1100-6530270/" data-ref-id="1100-6530270">a Split Fiction movie</a> in development, with Wicked director John M.

Gearbox Studios has released a handful of stats from Borderlands 4 that reveal just how far some players are willing to go to find loot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4570330-borderlands4stats.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570330" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4570330-borderlands4stats.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570330"></a><figcaption>A few stats from Borderlands 4's opening weekend, courtesy of Gearbox Studios.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4570330-borderlands4stats.jpg"></figure><p>According to the graph, 1,530,794 items were looted from an outhouse. Who knew there was so much treasure to be found there?! By comparison, only 487,585 items were looted from trashcans, which apparently means there's more to be gained from going into an outhouse than digging through a normal trash receptacle. Players also looted 1,811,970 items from boomboxes, beer coolers, and grills. However, red chests comfortably took the top slot with 14,814,296 items looted in the first weekend.</p><p>Getting all of that treasure didn't happen without a price; 2,034,399 players suffered an unfortunate end by barrel. Grenade fatalities were even higher with 4,563,416. Although deaths by toxic goo were much smaller with 349,734, those are the ones that looked like they hurt the most.</p><p>Among the game's vehicles, exactly 16,220,852 were destroyed, although the stat doesn't break it down by vehicle. Players attempted 62,718,658 boss battles, and 55,403,323 bosses fell in defeat. However, there were 16,220,852 failed boss encounters that left the players on the losing end.</p><p>Additionally, Gearbox shared a code for the Break Free Pack and two ECHO-4 drone skins: JS63J-JSCWJ-CFTBW-3TJ3J-WJS5R.</p><p>Although Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">had primarily positive critical reviews</a>, PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">have been very vocal on Steam</a> about performance and optimization issues. Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">disputed players' accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">remained defiant about the issue</a> while also offering optimization tips. Pitchford also noted that a PS5 Pro patch is in the works to combat issues on that console.</p><p>Borderlands 4 is out now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The Switch 2 port will be released on October 3.
