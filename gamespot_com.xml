Bio-Bulkhead now shows the correct elemental icon and movement has been smoothed to eliminate jitter after certain attacks</li><li>Warden Scathe no longer clips through arena walls in his boss fight</li><li>Improved Echo Location guidance across several missions</li><li>Patched collision gaps, holes, clipping, and invisible walls</li><li>Corrected Order drop pod events to consistently reach that ground and no longer appear stuck in the air</li><li>NPCs should no longer cause players or vehicles to get stuck when the player runs them over</li><li>Pangolin enemies can now be damaged by grenades while in ball mode</li><li>Chain Master trait now tethers to all allies in range when multiple enemies have the ability</li><li>Mangler enemies no longer desync their position when dodging in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Vault Hunter Changes</h3><h3>Harlowe the Gravitar</h3><ul><li>Addressed some Gravitar builds that reportedly caused performance slowdowns; they should no longer prevent UI elements from updating or Fight For Your Life sequences from completing</li><li>Gravitar passive and Augment bonuses to Gun Damage now correctly apply to Ripper Heavy Weapon barrels and the Ripper Legendary Heavy Weapon Steamer; Entanglement interactions also function as designed</li><li>Gravitar class mods have been adjusted to no longer roll +5 Pencils Down and push passives past their intended cap</li></ul><h3>Creative Bursts</h3><h3>Balance Adjustments:</h3><ul><li>Neutron Capture now converts all Gun Damage into radiation, and now only applies to Gun Shots, and not all instances of Gun Damage.</li></ul><p>Dev Note: Neutron Capture is one of the best damage scalars in the entire game, but during testing, we found that this was erroneously applying to all instances of Gun Damage and was able to scale in unanticipated ways as a result. This new change will still see Neutron Capture being one of the best (if not the best) damage scalars in the game, but the power level will be much more in line with our expectations. Additionally, since all damage from the Gun is converted into Radiation, it should have more scaling vectors for clever build crafters, and allow for meaningful boosts from Gun Damage.</p><h3>Cosmic Brilliance - Passive</h3><ul><li>Flux Generator + Annihilation interaction updated so spawned grenades now scale correctly with character level</li></ul><h3>Amon the Forgeknight</h3><ul><li>Shield visuals adjusted for improved clarity in combat situations</li></ul><h3>Trait - Forgeskill</h3><ul><li>Adjusted interaction with Forge Master class mod so Forgeskill now respects its cooldown in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Onslaughter - Calamity</h3><ul><li>Camera behavior stabilized when combining Onslaughter with Order Legendary Pistol Noisy Cricket</li><li>Attack frequency of Rocket Punch is now consistent in multiplayer</li></ul><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Seeing Red Duration restored no longer increases per point invested, and is now 4 seconds for all ranks.</li></ul><p>Dev Note: Seeing Red was always meant to have huge damage scaling potential, but was always meant to be hard to maintain. We didn't want to nerf this passive's power, but we're making the effect harder to maintain.</p><h3>Scourge - Vengeance</h3><ul><li>Scorched Kairos passive now displays consistent magazine size values for the Ordnance gadget</li><li>The Forgewave no longer fires unintentionally during Glacial Rapture</li><li>Projectiles no longer get stuck in the air when Forgemaster Firewall is active during the Fortress Indomita boss fight</li><li>Blackout Shock Damage now properly scales with points invested</li><li>Blackout is now 15% per point, down from 21% per point</li></ul><p>Dev Note: After fixing the scaling of the DoT (damage over time), we found that Blackout was overperforming a bit, so we gave it a slight re-adjustment. This will still be an overall buff, now that the DoT properly scales.</p><h3>Crucible - Cybernetics</h3><ul><li>Visuals corrected so Forgeknight Forgeaxe no longer disappears when activating Crucible at the same time as throwing with Double-Edge</li><li>Corrected animation of Crucible while climbing</li><li>Raging Inferno Incendiary Damage now properly scales with points invested</li><li>Vex the Siren</li><li>Challenge “Me, Myself, Myself, and I.” now tracks correctly in multiplayer, independent of clone duration on other players</li><li>Dead Ringer - The Fourth Seal</li><li>Specter’s copied weapon now displays proper visual effects when firing with a Maliwan Element Switcher</li><li>Incarnate - Vexcalation</li><li>Bleed from Bloodletter has been updated so it no longer recursively triggers itself, preventing unintended damage loops</li><li>Phase Phamiliar - Here Comes Trouble</li></ul><h3>Balance Adjustments</h3><ul><li>Double Trouble Illusion Damage Multiplier is now 75%, up from 50%</li><li>Double Trouble Illusion's Duration is now 8 seconds, up from 5 seconds</li><li>Apex Beast Damage Dealt increase increased to 15% from 10% per stack of Unsealed</li><li>Rafa the Exo-Soldier</li><li>Free Grenade from Filantropo class mod now deals appropriate damage even when no grenade is equipped</li><li>People Person skill tree</li><li>Action Skills - APOPHIS Lance</li><li>APOPHIS Lance changed to penalize Gun Accuracy instead of Gun Handling, resulting in projectile speed being unaffected.</li><li>APOPHIS Lance now benefits from cooldown reduction effects</li></ul><h3>Gear</h3><ul><li>Skills that boost Gun Handling now properly increase Projectile Speed</li><li>Addressed reports that swapping weapons with the Free Loader Enhancement on an Order weapon with a Ripper magazine would cause all weapons to not consume the accurate amount of ammo</li><li>Health restoration from Legendary Repkit Adrenaline Pump now works correctly when combined with Legendary Shield Guardian Angel</li><li>Reduced critical chance on Jakobs crit knife to 30%</li><li>Dev Note: It had to happen, you knew it was going to happen!</li><li>Jakobs Legendary Pistol San Saba Songbird no longer stacks infinitely when swapping weapons</li><li>Using a Jakobs Shotgun with Torgue sticky projectiles and the Knife Launcher underbarrel no longer deals knife damage after switching fire modes</li><li>Jakobs weapon parts updated so ricochet effects only trigger from intended damage sources</li><li>Ripper Legendary Shotgun Golden God overheating effect now clears correctly when switching weapons</li><li>Corrected behavior on Maliwan Legendary SMG Ohm I Got so the first three shots no longer consume ammo without dealing damage during continuous fire</li><li>Maliwan Legendary Heavy Gun Gamma Void corrected to apply proper increased Radiation damage to enemies inside the Singularity</li><li>Weapons with COV magazines now function correctly if a repair animation is interrupted with a Repkit in multiplayer</li><li>Daedalus Legendary SMG Frangible removed from chest loot tables</li><li>Daedalus Legendary AR First Impression reduced the critical damage multiplier</li><li>Recoil behavior improved while charging and firing Order ARs and Torgue Heavy with Triple Barrel parts with Gun Handling passives</li><li>Vladof Flamethrower underbarrel no longer deals infinite damage or bypasses Bio Armor</li><li>Torgue Grenades with Spring and Apex Augments now always explode on its first apex</li><li>Grenades with Spring Augment and Divider Payload now have the intended three additional bounces when paired</li><li>Gadgets no longer reset to maximum uses after gaining Second Wind</li><li>Healing Orbs spawned from Legendary Repkit Kill Spring can no longer heal enemies</li><li>Order Legendary Shield Cindershelly combat voice lines now trigger at the intended frequency, less often to be less distracting</li><li>Tediore underbarrel names now match correctly across item cards and ammo widgets</li><li>Maliwan Lingering Payload and Splat Pack Augment projectiles no longer persist when thrown at vending machines</li><li>Gear Balance: Assault Rifles:</li><li>Star Helix fire rate increased by 33%</li><li>Bonnie and Clyde base damage increased by 40%; Pair of Thieves: Bonus damage granted increased to 150% from 100%</li><li>Bugbear base damage increased by 40%; Rotary Gun: Max Damage increased to 200% from 100%</li><li>Rowan's Charge base fire rate increased by 100%</li><li>Rowan's Charge recoil reduced slightly</li><li>Lucian's Flank base damage increased by 50%</li><li>Lucian's Flank recoil reduced slightly</li><li>Aegon's Dream base damage increased by 35%</li></ul><h3>Heavy Weapon Ordnance:</h3><ul><li>Gamma Void base damage increased by 450%; Singularity Duration decreased to 6s from 10s, Radiation damage amp increased to 50% from 40%, Gamma Void Cooldown increased by 100%</li><li>Ravenfire base damage increased by 25%</li><li>Class Mods: Dev Notes: Class Mods relating to Melee Damage, Action Skill Damage, and specific one-off stats on Legendaries have been buffed to make them more desirable.</li></ul><h3>All Class Mods:</h3><ul><li>Melee Damage Action Skill Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 60%</li><li>Skill Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 45%</li></ul><h3>Siren Class Mods:</h3><ul><li>Avatar's Attunement Skill Duration on level 50 class mods has increased to 45%</li><li>Kindread Spirits' Command Skill Cooldown rate on level 50 class mods has increased to 45%</li><li>Forgeknight Class Mods:</li><li>Blacksmith's Forgedrone Duration on level 50 class mods has increased to 45%</li><li>Blacksmith's Legendary Effect now also increases all Forgedrone Damage by 20% per active Forgedrone</li><li>Viking's Detonation Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 60%</li><li>Forge Master's Forgeskill Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 60%</li><li>Elementalist's Legendary Effect now also increases all Damage Dealt by Amon by 2% per active Affinity Stack</li></ul><h3>Gravitar Class Mods:</h3><ul><li>Bio-Robot's Hazard Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 60%</li><li>Skeptic's Stasis Damage on level 50 class mods has increased to 60%</li></ul><h3>Other Gear:</h3><p>Dev Notes: Gear effects that are related to Melee and Action Skill Damage have increased effectiveness. We want these builds to be pushed up a bit, but wanted to distribute the power among the various pieces of gear to make them more desirable.</p><h3>Rep Kits:</h3><ul><li>Hard Hitter now grants 50% Melee Damage Dealt, up from 40%</li></ul><h3>Firm Ware:</h3><ul><li>Reel Big Fist now grants 25% Melee Damage at rank 1 and 2, up from 15%/25%</li><li>Action Fist now grants 25% Melee Damage at rank 1, up from 15%</li><li>Action Fist now grants 30% Action Skill Damage at rank 2, up from 30%</li><li>Action Fist now grants 30% Action Skill Damage on Melee Kill, up from 25%</li></ul><h3>Shields:</h3><ul><li>Boxer Armor Shields now grant 20%/30%/50% Melee Damage depending on parts rolled, up from 15%/25%/40%</li><li>Berserker Energy Shields now grant 20%/30%/50% Melee Damage depending on parts rolled, up from 20%/27.5%/35%</li></ul><h3>Specializations</h3><p><strong>Groundbreaker:</strong></p><ul><li>Groundbreaker now only stores Gun, Action Skill, and Ordnance damage.</li></ul><p>Dev Note: Groundbreaker was causing recursive loops that could lead to infinite damage by storing “Bonus Damage” across the board. We still want this skill to be effective, but it should not be able to scale infinitely. We’ll be monitoring Melee builds after this change to make sure they are meeting expectations, and will further adjust if necessary. This ultimately had to be fixed so we can establish a baseline before we investigate further buffs/changes.</p><h3>UI &amp; UX &amp; Text</h3><ul><li>Sorting settings in menus now persist when switching tabs or leaving the menu</li><li>“Toggle Junk” behavior has been corrected to target the desired item in Bank menus and Backpack</li><li>Weapon wheel no longer sticks when opened near Guns vending machines</li><li>Combat Radar now features a dedicated Legendary Loot Indicator, making high-value drops easier to spot in the heat of combat</li><li>Press/Hold input now cancels correctly without triggering unintended actions</li><li>“Apply Settings” prompt only appears when changes are made</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Splitscreen updates, including number text scaling, Equipment/Backpack improvements, scrollbar behaviors, Party list layout, and “Flip Card” functionality</li><li>Restored Fullscreen resolution controls and switching behavior</li><li>Weekly Activities now populate after campaign completion</li><li>Maurice's Black Market Vending Machine timer updates to show correct cooldown</li><li>Firmware 3-Piece bonuses (Ahoy, Oscar Mike, Daed-dy O’) now show cooldown icons; Deadeye Tier-3 stacks now appear in the passive bar</li><li>Boss Bar spacing corrected when Combat Radar is active</li><li>Transfer Machine naming has been standardized across the game</li><li>Travel notification now displays the initiating player’s name</li><li>ECHO Location path remains readable over time; made improvements to pathfinding</li><li>Updated various UI visuals and icons for alignment, consistency, and clarity</li><li>Updated localization and various text descriptions across the game</li><li>Standardized/updated terminology across gear, menus, customization, and manufacturers</li></ul><h3>Visuals</h3><ul><li>Updated various character and NPC animations</li><li>Corrected various reported instances of VFX not rendering correctly</li><li>Grapple Vault points now show proper models instead of placeholders</li><li>Reduced reported instances of visual pops at cinematic starts</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>Audio and VO now remain active when returning to menus after level traveling in multiplayer</li><li>Adjusted audio mix for improved balance across gameplay and VO</li><li>SFX volume slider now correctly applies to high HDR-value sounds</li><li>Addressed several reported instances of VO not playing as intended across multiple missions and scenarios</li><li>Vault Hunter battle voiceover frequency has been tuned so lines repeat less often</li><li>Missing pain reaction audio restored for several named NPCs</li><li>Improved various subtitle timing and text</li><li>Background music now continues as expected during the Idolator Sol boss fight</li><li>Unique audio cue restored for Phosphene (shiny) gear spawns</li></ul><h3>Settings &amp; Accessibility</h3><ul><li>Personal Cross-play settings can now be adjusted immediately after switching Party Privacy from Local Only to Public in Session Settings</li><li>Air Dash is now fully usable on controller when Toggle Crouch is set to Off under Accessibility → Gameplay</li><li>Individual graphics options now reset properly after making changes and then selecting Run Auto-Detect in Options</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] Field of View resets consistently to Default on consoles without showing mismatched values</li></ul><h3>Player Experience</h3><ul><li>Improvements to stability</li><li>We are continuing to investigate and will make further improvements to stability and performance.</li><li>Addressed multiple reported issues across multiplayer, missions, menus, and engine systems.</li><li>Improved matchmaking and session stability.</li><li>Addressed performance in multiplayer when there were large numbers of homing projectiles</li><li>Refined graphics settings and shader handling</li><li>Improvements made to patch reliability and automation processes</li><li>Ocean could occasionally fail to load</li></ul><h3>Miscellaneous</h3><ul><li>[Epic] Rich Presence now displays correctly in non-English languages on Epic</li><li>[PS5] Friend list now loads properly after logging out and back in during patch checks on the title screen</li><li>Joystick input now behaves consistently when lowering deadzones</li><li>[PS5 and Xbox] SHiFT account linking verification codes now auto-copy and apply correctly on console</li></ul><h2>Weekly Activities:</h2><p>Weekly Big Encore Boss has switched to a tougher variant of a different existing boss with an even more rewarding loot pool for those that take it on.</p><ul><li>The Battle Wagon</li></ul><p>The Weekly Wildcard Mission has changed.

                <p>In side-by-side comparisons, PlayStation 5 games have tended to have an edge over their Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S counterparts. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, however, flips that script by having a better performance on Xbox than either PS5 or PS5 Pro, according to Digital Foundry.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkhp-FUuC7s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zkhp-FUuC7s?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>0n the surface, The Outer Worlds 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X look very similar, but a closer examination reveals that the former suffers from image breakup, lower resolution, frame rate drops, and screen tearing even in performance mode. Digital Foundry also noted small lighting downgrades in PS5.</p><p>As for the PS5 Pro, the report states that it uses Sony's proprietary upscaler, PSSR, which doesn't interact well with The Outer Worlds 2's lumen lighting or RT lighting effects. The report concludes that PS5 Pro's "frame rate dips and more intense encounters are common, and the general run of play is noticeably worse than Series X in the finished game." It goes on to speculate that The Outer Worlds 2 may have utilized some proprietary hardware features in Xbox Series X|S that neither the PS5 nor PS5 Pro have.</p><p>Obsidian Entertainment recently introduced players to Outer Worlds 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/meet-the-outer-worlds-2-companions-whom-you-cant-romance/1100-6534102/" data-ref-id="1100-6534102">six companion characters who can't be romanced</a>, before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/your-outer-worlds-2-companions-will-turn-on-you-if-you-screw-up/1100-6535577/" data-ref-id="1100-6535577">they can turn on the player</a> if given a compelling reason to do so.
