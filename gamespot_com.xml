                <p dir="ltr">Today, NetherRealm Studios hosted the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68xHLNtlfsw">Kombat Kast</a>--the semi-regular livestream highlighting new characters and features coming to Mortal Kombat 1 in the near future. Though Halloween was last month, the presentation kept the scares going with a full reveal of Ghostface from Scream, along with an interesting twist: The character is actually <em>three</em> Ghostfaces in one, and two of them are from the Mortal Kombat universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast started with the gameplay trailer for the new fighter, which showed off multiple moves and combos, a fourth-wall-breaking Fatality, and a tease at his Animality where he morphs into a buzzard. After the trailer, it was explained that the original Ghostface--the one transported to the Mortal Kombat timeline--is the main fighter, but he can call other Ghostfaces into battle for him.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Ghostface DLC Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Those other Ghostfaces--per NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback--are "not anonymous," but instead are known characters from the Mortal Kombat canon. The only clues given during the stream were that both were recruited from Kano's Black Dragon clan, and that the male Ghostface is called "Black Dragon Enforcer" and the female is "Black Dragon Assassin." Each of the Black Dragon Ghostfaces have "clues" and "Easter eggs" that present while they're on-screen, and it will be up to the players to figure out who is who.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast also revealed new features and adjustments to the roster, including new moves and abilities for Ashrah, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, among others. A replay takeover was also highlighted, where players can rewatch a recent online match and "take over" for a brief period of time, in order to analyze the situation and strategize for future matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ghostface will officially join the roster on November 26, while those with early access through the Premium or Kollector's Edition will be able to play as the Scream killer one week sooner on November 19.</p>

                <p>Last year, quality-assurance workers at Bethesda and ZeniMax studios formed ZeniMax Workers United, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">the largest certified video game union</a> in the United States. Now that union is putting its collective power to the test in a brief strike against Bethesda and ZeniMax's parent company, Microsoft.</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United has been attempting to negotiate a deal with Microsoft over remote-work requirements while also limiting the number of outsourced QA workers who can be brought in on Bethesda's projects. The union didn't say who Microsoft is outsourcing QA work to, but it accused the company of ignoring requests to negotiate.</p><p>"They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it's become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked," QA test lead Rhyanna Eichnersaid told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>.</p><p>This one-day strike was called in an attempt to make Microsoft more receptive to addressing the union's concerns.</p><p>"Striking isn't fun or ideal, but there's a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions," noted senior QA tester Juniper Dowell. "Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table."</p><p>According to Dowell, many of the QA testers were hired during the COVID pandemic when remote work was more prevalent. Microsoft's current requirements call for QA workers to be in the office two days a week, while the union is asking for a more flexible remote policy.</p><p>After the strike began, Microsoft issued a statement affirming the company's willingness to "listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quote from MS rep to me re: today's ZeniMax strike (over remote work, outsourcing): "We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today. We will continue to listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table.” <a href="https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/pmYpUyPvS2</a></p>  — Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo) <a href="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>If the one-day strike fails to motivate Microsoft to make any concessions or changes, it could lead to a longer strike in the future.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's in-game store gets stocked with all manner of microtransactions tomorrow, November 14, to kick off the game's Season 1. And included among them is the BlackCell bundle, which features Goliath as its headlining hero. Goliath is one of the most unique Call of Duty operators to date.</p><p>Goliath has a "molten, crystalized skull" whose armor emits flames. As you can see in the trailer below, Goliath is a menacing force to be reckoned with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgDL9clbEdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AgDL9clbEdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>BlackCell bundles are Call of Duty's most expensive in-game offerings, coming in at around $30. For that price, purchasers get a new Operator, along with 20 Battle Pass tier skips, an allotment of 1,110 COD Points to spend on other stuff, and exclusive guns. For the Season 1 BlackCell DLC, this includes the "Boiling Point" assault rifle that is actually dripping with fire. It also comes with the "Who's Laughing Now" finishing move in which Goliath's hyena companion comes in and tears your enemy apart. The bundle also includes a special BlackCell clan tag to show off in lobbies and winner's cricles.</p><p>Beyond all of this, BlackCell owners get BlackCell-exclusive skins for Sev, Bayan, Bailey, Carver, Alvarez, and Stone, along with six BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints. People who buy the BlackCell DLC can also unlock any single page of the Battle Pass and bypass the normal requirements. What's more, there are more than 130 rewards that BlackCell owners can unlock throughout Season 1.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399179" data-ratio="0.55712603062426" data-width="1698" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399179"></a><figcaption>The new BlackCell bundle goes live on November 14</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png"></figure><p>If you don't want to spend $30 on the BlackCell bundle, Black Ops 6's in-game store will receive many other bundles for the Season 1 launch, including one that turns you into a shark.
