                <p dir="ltr">Recently, the internet-at-large has become fixated on a simple question: Could a single gorilla defeat 100 humans, or would the humans emerge victorious? Overwatch 2 is leaning into the discussion, as Blizzard has announced a special livestream for May 6 in which 100 copies of Soldier 76 will face off against a single Winston to see who wins.</p><p dir="ltr">The stream, which will take place May 6 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET, will also feature "surprise content creators" as the 100 Soldier 76s do battle with a single Winston. The official Overwatch X account is running a poll on who viewers think will win, with Winston holding a slight lead at 57 percent as of this writing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918375050308182070" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1 Gorilla, 100 Soldiers: Who Wins? ü¶çüíØ<br>Join us along with some surprise content creators for an epic showdown between 1 Winston vs. 100 Soldier: 76 LIVE May 6 at 12pm PT üèÜ <a href="https://t.co/LE45sjLDyE" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LE45sjLDyE</a></p>  ‚Äî Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918375050308182070?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The "1 Gorilla vs 100 Humans" meme began back in 2020, when a post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whowouldwin/comments/hlul5b/100_men_versus_1_silverback_gorilla/" rel="nofollow ">subreddit r/whowouldwin</a> asked the question and provided some scenarios. It recently resurfaced when Jimmy "MrBeast" Donaldson <a href="https://x.com/MrBeast/status/1916889284004426042" rel="nofollow ">posted on X</a> that he needed "100 men to test this" with a YouTube thumbnail reading "100 Men vs. A Gorilla."</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 is a free-to-play 5v5 first-person-shooter which first launched in October 2022. A recent update added a new game mode, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/">Stadium</a>, in which two teams of five face off in a best-of-seven series, with the ability to upgrade each hero between rounds.</p><p dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The 100 Soldier 76 vs 1 Winston livestream is set for May 6 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET on the official <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playoverwatch">Overwatch Twitch</a> channel.</p>
