                <p>2K Sports has confirmed that WWE 2K24 will be delisted as of January 31, 2026, with servers shutting down on March 31, 2026.

The game's offline modes like Play Now and Showcase will remain available after the servers go dark.</p><p>All virtual currency, along with DLC and add-ons, will be removed from sale on January 31, 2026, along with the game itself, as mentioned.</p><p>WWE 2K24 was released in March 2024, so the servers will have been online for about two years. The impending closure is a bummer for people who want to keep playing online, but this kind of thing is not uncommon in the world of sports games and beyond, for 2K and other publishers.</p><p>In September this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-shutting-down-servers-for-these-two-games-soon/1100-6534421/" data-ref-id="1100-6534421">2K shut off the online servers for The Golf Club 2019 and PGA Tour 2K21</a>.

                <p>If you find yourself with a shiny new Meta Quest headset during the holidays, be sure to check out the new Winter 2025 Edition of Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Create+Your+Own+VR+Games+Bundle+For+Less+Than+%243+Per+Game&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-12-22+07%3A28%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-22+11%3A30%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6537134&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-quest-vr-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanatical-build-your-own-quest-vr-bundle%2F1100-6537134%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle</a> deal. Like other Fanatical deals, you choose from a catalog of 21 games (all of which are offered as official keys for your Quest), and the more you buy, the more you'll save. <strong>Buy two or more games to get each for $9, four or more for $8.75/each, and seven or more for $8.50/each.</strong> If you want, you can add 21 games to your bundle, in which case you'll pay $178.50--while that's higher than most Fanatical bundle deals, it's still a massive 65% savings compared to the bundle's $471.79 value.</p><p>As for the games in the bundle, if you're a fan of Superhot, take a peek at Chronostrike. The stylized shooter emphasizes cooperative play, tasking you and a buddy to take down hordes of foes while deflecting bullets, manipulating time, and making liberal use of your environment to your advantage. There are also more traditional shooters like Contracts Shadow: ExfilZone. Fans of dark fantasy dungeon crawls should check out Amid Evil VR, which offers a frantic melee adventure with classic Quake-style movement and level design.</p><p>For something more strategic, check out Neon Squad Tactics. The top-down, turn-based, cyberpunk tactics game lets players choose from nine unique characters and fight across 31 maps. Meanwhile, 7th Guest VR and Shadow Chambers are great picks for more immersive, puzzle-filled adventure games.</p><p>The bundle also offers creative VR experiences like SuchArt and SculptrVR. The former has you whipping up colorful creations in your studio as you earn cash to upgrade your gear, while the latter lets you try your hand at sculpting (which, thanks to its innovative tools, is much easier than the real thing).</p><p>Plenty of other great games are eligible for the Build Your Own Quest VR Bundle, so be sure to check out the full list below. All of the VR games purchased in this bundle are delivered as official codes that can be redeemed via the Meta Quest launcher.</p><p>Along with the games, the deal includes a 5%-off coupon code usable on a future Fanatical purchase.
