                <p>Halloween may be over, but as they say on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x-files-creator-claims-ryan-coogler-is-rebooting-the-franchise/1100-6512774/" data-ref-id="1100-6512774">The X-Files</a>, the truth is out there in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-online-review/1900-6415473/" data-ref-id="1900-6415473">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>. Alien abductions are still taking place in Los Santos, and you're going want to be among the abductees if you'd like to get a cool weapon. But players are going to need to act fast, because these visitors from another world won't be hanging around forever.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3335k2ok38135/escape-alien-abduction-in-gta-online-this-halloween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Games</a> announced the alien abduction for this year's Halloween events, and it's going on through November 6. That means the skies are still strange, and players who make it out alive can earn The Shocker, a non-lethal alien weapon that acts like a stun baton. The hard part, however, might be getting captured in the first place.</p><p>The first thing that you need to know is that the aliens only come out at night from 10 PM to 4 AM in the game world, and given GTA Online's fast movement of time, this means that there's only a 12-minute window to find a UFO ship and get under it. Another complication is that your vehicles will fail if they get too close to the UFOs, so plan accordingly.</p><p>If you've successfully pulled off the abduction, the next step is escape. Players will find themselves locked in a room under Fort Zancudo. That's where The Shocker can be found, but players still have to get out with their lives in order to keep it. Opening the exit requires some close examinations of the clues in the chamber. Fortunately, The Gaming Gorilla has shared a video that breaks down how to get out of the room before a lethal gas makes this a one-way trip.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44cHCm6FM08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44cHCm6FM08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you miss your opportunity to get abducted this year, it's likely that Rockstar will revisit the idea in time for Halloween 2025. But for now, you only have until Wednesday, November 6 to pull off what may be the spookiest mission in the game to date.</p>
