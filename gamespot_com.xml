                <p>In 2013, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-resigns/1100-6405525/" data-ref-id="1100-6405525">stepped down as EA's CEO</a> following a tumultuous six-year run on top of the company. During Riccitiello's reign, Activision's Call of Duty franchise overtook Battlefield in terms of popularity, and it didn't help when Riccitiello <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/article/unitys-ceo-devs-pay-per-install-charge-fps-gamers-per-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that Battlefield players should be charged to reload</a>. Now, ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has shared his belief that Riccitiello was the worst CEO in the video game industry.</p><p>During a joint appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit</a> with former EA Chief Creative Officer Bing Gordon, Kotick revealed that Activision was afraid that Gordon would assume control of EA and prove to be a good leader for the company.</p><p>"I'm not saying this because [Gordon is] sitting here," said Kotick. "Our fear was always that Bing was going to run [EA]. And we would have paid for Riccitiello to stay a CEO forever... like we thought he was the worst CEO in video games." Gordon also noted that Riccitiello may have hastened his departure from EA as well.</p><p>Regardless of his feelings about Riccitiello, Kotick said that there were multiple attempts in the past to bring EA and Activision together as a single company.</p><p>"[EA] tried to buy us a bunch of times. We had merger conversations," recalled Kotick. Later in the podcast, Kotick admitted that Activision thought that EA's "business [was] in a lot of ways was better than ours," before Gordon pointed out that Blizzard's business is even better than EA's.</p><p>During that same interview, Gordon recalled that EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/" data-ref-id="1100-6529398">passed on the chance to buy Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and Blizzard</a> before Activision ultimately swept up all three. Kotick also called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">the Warcraft film one of the worst movies</a> he's ever seen and explained why it was a mistake for Blizzard to focus so much attention on that project.</p>
