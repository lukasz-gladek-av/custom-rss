                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mafia-the-old-country/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> keeps things focused with its recreation of 1900s Sicily, but for fans looking to break free from the linear nature of its design, a new Free Ride mode will be added to the game in the coming months. This will be a free update, and <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1956025890632077319" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">developer Hangar 13 says</a> it will add "new activities" and gameplay content. More details on it will be shared at a later date.</p><p>This will likely be similar to the Free Ride mode found in Mafia: Definitive Edition, which gave players more activities to pursue within that game's open-world structure. Mafia: The Old Country does offer a free-roam mode that can be accessed via the Chapter Replay menu, but when compared to the bustling levels of the main story campaign, the world does feel empty in comparison. It is worth checking out if you're a completionist, as you can hunt down collectibles and fully upgrade Enzo's arsenal along the way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Hangar 13 shared a few more details on the game, as it says that in its first week, more than 600 million shots have been fired, 185 enemies have been taken down, 17 million bandages have been used to patch Enzo up, and players have "earned" a total of 10 billion Dinari from their sessions. And they say that (video game) crime doesn't pay.</p><p>One of the big new games for August, Mafia: The Old Country has received fairly positive reviews. Critics have highlighted its gorgeous recreation of Italy and excellent performances, while also noting that its gameplay systems can feel archaic at times.</p><p>"Mafia: The Old Country is at its best when things slow down, letting you take in all the sights and sounds of Sicily. Like previous Mafia games, it nails the look and feel of its real-world counterpart by investing heavily in the details. Unfortunately, generic gameplay and dated mission design hold Mafia: The Old Country back, making it feel like a relic of the early 2010s," Jake Dekker wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mafia-the-old-country-review-look-but-dont-touch/1900-6418393/">GameSpot's review</a>.</p>

                <p>Although handhelds are getting more powerful chips, they still lag behind the hardware that can be found in desktop and laptop PCs. However, one modder has created their own handheld system based on high-end laptop hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">Billibilli creator Qingchen DIY (via <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-builds-12-5-inch-4k-gaming-handheld-powered-by-nvidia-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu" rel="nofollow ">Videocardz</a>) has a built a portable device that has a huge 12.5-inch 4K IPS display panel. In their video, the custom handheld is shown to be running on Windows 11, while the system settings shows that it contains an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 laptop GPU as well as an Intel Core i9-149000HX CPU. It also contains 64GB of DDR5-5600 memory and 2TB of storage.</p><p dir="ltr"><span>It appears that this was a laptop that has been converted into a gaming handheld, with a light green shell containing the usual thumbsticks and face buttons, as well as a number of ports and a cooling vent at the top.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Qingchen DIY also demonstrates the system running Horizon Forbidden West, God of War, and Cyberpunk 2077 at 4K, with the temperature staying at 72ºC, although it is also relying on an external power source to maintain high performance.</p><p dir="ltr">Compared to other handhelds available commercially, the largest handheld is the Acer Nitro Blaze, which has an 10.95-inch display. Most handheld chipsets also use GPUs from AMD, except for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, both of which use custom versions of Nvidia's Tegra mobile chipsets.</p><p dir="ltr">Although the Switch 2's hardware lags behind PC handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally X, Nvidia boss Jensen Huang previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-claims-the-switch-2-redefines-portable-gaming-graphics/1100-6532023/">the Switch 2 has redefined portable gaming graphics</a>.</p>

The smugglers have coin to trade for certain treasures--but some of it is risky cargo to haul across the high seas.</p><p>To start your dealings with the League, you'll first have to find them, tracking down one of the well-hidden and booby-trapped Smugglers' Hideouts scattered across the map. While the League has interest in more standard treasures including fine art and fine rum, their main focus is on explosive Black Powder Barrels--a risky cargo to be carrying on your ship.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Reuq0Pgi5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Reuq0Pgi5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once players have tracked down a Hideout, they'll be able to pick up Smugglers' Route Runs, delivering often-dangerous cargo from one point to another. Smugglers' Runs can also be picked up from a message in a bottle bearing the Smugglers' mark.</p><p>The League also has some valuable cargo unaccounted for, with Smugglers' Shipwrecks offering plentiful opportunities for enterprising pirates to plunder. Find missing cargo on the sea floor, washed up on beaches, or reclaim it from Skeleton Ships and return it to the League for a big reward.</p><p>This is just Act 1 of the new season, with more content including heists set to unlock as Act 2 and 3 follow throughout September and October.</p><p>The new season also includes a variety of new cosmetics available at the Pirate Emporium, with more able to be unlocked from the Plunder Pass. For the first time, players will be able to play with extra characters, with the new Pirate Profiles system allowing you to start from scratch with a new pirate--without wiping your current progress.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The Fell Council is also getting a rework--one member of the Council will be designated as Council Speaker each time you fight them, gaining enhanced abilities along with the title promotion. Players will also have the option of ignoring the Fell Council altogether and opting into a brand-new boss fight with Vizjerei Warlord Bartuc--formerly the Warlord of Blood, now the Warlord of Chaos. Players will have to spend Aether to fight Bartuc, but the punishing boss fight promises increased rewards if the party successfully defeats him.</p><p>While most of the Infernal Hordes rework provides more challenging fights for experienced players, Blizzard is also introducing a stripped-down, earlier-game version called Fleeting Hordes. The mode will be available in pre-Torment tiers, and will consist of four waves before facing off against two members of the Fell Council.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212"></a><figcaption>Chaos Monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg"></figure><p><span>A new unique armor type called Chaos Armor is also being introduced in the next PTR, allowing players to harness the power of Chaos for themselves. Chaos Armor provides a more powerful version of existing unique items, but true to its name, Chaos items will only drop for an item slot other than the one the original item was intended for--unique boots may drop as gloves, for example, or an amulet as chest armor. The item shakeup will enable new builds, allowing players to combine affixes in ways that weren't previously possible.</span></p><p>All Diablo 4 players on PC can opt into the PTR through the Battle.net app--including Game Pass players, who can access the Battle.net client through the Xbox App. The Season 10 PTR will be open from August 19 to August 26.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list</a> of new content and patch notes for the 2.4.0 PTR below:</p><h2>Infernal Hordes Reborn</h2><p>The Infernal Hordes are hotter than ever; we’re dialing up the intensity on this incendiary mode.</p><p>Infernal Hordes refined</p><ul><li>We’ve done a significant re-work of Infernal Offerings revealed between each Wave. Our goal is to try to make all offerings feel valid as choices for you as you start to stack them to focus on your run.</li><li>We’re doing this by balancing existing offerings, changing the effects of some offerings, and adjusting base Monster populations.</li><li>At the start of the Infernal Hordes, you’ll now start with an Infernal Offering to immediately stoke the embers and breathe some fire into your run.</li></ul><h4>The Fell Council</h4><p>The Fell Council has had some promotions. When fighting them, one of their members will now be the designated Council Speaker, and gain enhanced abilities.</p><h4>Chaos Monsters</h4><p>Hell has unearthed a new monster family from deep its horrid maw. Born of smoke and brimstone, these Chaos Monsters provide a powerful shrine-like buff when killed.</p><h4>Chaos Waves</h4><p>Hellfire brews the dastardliest maladies. Within the Infernal Hordes, you’ll occasionally be offered the choice of a Chaos Wave within the Infernal Hordes from your Infernal Offerings. You can expect an amount of Chaos Waves offered relative to the Infernal Compass Tier each time you enter the Infernal Hordes.</p><p>Chaos Waves completely alter the upcoming wave, imbuing havoc and intense challenge. These waves will have significantly increased difficulty, but reward far more Aether should you be able to survive.</p><p>Chaos Waves will have many different combinations to discover and master. Dodge deadly projectiles from Chaos Rifts, slay a rampaging Hellwyrm, or hunt down erratic Aether Goblins. Chaos awaits!</p><h4>Fight Bartuc, the Warlord of Blood</h4><p>Rather than facing off against the Fell Council, you can choose to risk your hard-earned Aether and throw down against the insidious, reborn Bartuc to complete your Infernal Hordes run.</p><h4>The Fleeting Hordes</h4><p>We’re introducing a warming version of the Infernal Hordes to burn through earlier in your character journey.</p><p>In Pre-Torment Tiers, you’ll play this modified version of the Infernal Hordes to slay through before reaching Torment difficulties.</p><p>Fleeting Hordes will be 4 waves in total, with limited Infernal Offerings to keep the packs of vicious Goblins under control.</p><p>Upon completing the 4 waves, you’ll fight two Fell Council members before you can spend your hard-earned Aether for rewards.</p><hr><h2>Bartuc Beckons</h2><p>An infamous Vizjerei Warlord known for his acts of cruelty performed in the Mage Clan Wars, Bartuc’s perversion knows no bounds. He returns to Sanctuary with a new title, Warlord of Chaos.</p><ul><li>Each member of your party will need to spend Aether to fight the infamous Vizjerei, Bartuc who was once known as the Warlord of Blood. The first player who chooses sets the decision for the rest of the party.</li><li>Bartuc will harness Chaos Portals to shoot projectiles at your location, master his tactics and enter these Chaos Portals tactically to gain the upper hand.</li><li>Upon defeat, Bartuc’s rewards will appear on the ground, so you do not have to spend additional Aether to claim these spoils.</li></ul><hr><h2>Harness Entropy with Chaos Armor</h2><p>A new Unique Armor type—Chaos Armor—has entered Sanctuary.</p><ul><li>Chaos Armor is a more powerful version of existing Unique items that come with a diabolical twist. Chaos Armor are Unique items that appear as more powerful counterparts for other Item slots, leading to entirely new ways of dispensing carnage. Chaos Armor can appear for the following item slots:  <ul><li>Helm</li><li>Chest</li><li>Gloves</li><li>Pants</li><li>Boots</li></ul></li><li>Chaos Armor will only appear as an item fit for anything other than its original slot. For example, Flickerstep won’t have a Chaos Armor version in the Boots slot.</li><li>Chaos Unique Powers are also more potent than their normal counterpart, always appear at Maximum power, and have at least one Greater Affix.</li><li>Note: you won’t be able to equip the same Unique item between Chaos version and standard.</li></ul><p>For example, you could have Fists of Fate drop as a Helm instead of as Gloves, allowing you to equip a different set of Unique Gloves to compound those affixes in a combination that was previously unavailable.</p><p>The following Uniques will be available as Chaos Unique:</p><h4>General Uniques</h4><ul><li>Banished Lord’s Talisman</li><li>Crown of Lucion</li><li>Endurant Faith</li><li>Fists of Fate</li><li>Flickerstep</li><li>Godslayer Crown</li><li>Locran’s Talisman</li><li>Mother’s Embrace</li><li>Paingorger’s Gauntlets</li><li>X’fal’s Corroded Signet</li></ul><h4>Barbarian</h4><ul><li>Battle Trance</li><li>Gohr’s Devastating Grips</li><li>Hooves of the Mountain God</li><li>Mantle of Mountain’s Fury</li><li>Overkill</li><li>Rage of Harrogath</li><li>Ring of Red Furor</li><li>Ring of the Ravenous</li><li>Sabre of Tsasgal (New Unique)</li><li>Tuskhelm of Joritz the Mighty</li><li>Ugly Bastard Helm</li><li>Unbroken Chain</li></ul><h4>Druid</h4><ul><li>Airidah’s Inexorable Will</li><li>Earthbreaker</li><li>Fleshrender</li><li>Greatstaff of the Crone</li><li>Hunter’s Zenith</li><li>Kilt of Blackwing (New Unique)</li><li>Malefic Crescent</li><li>Mjolnic Ring</li><li>Rotting Lightbringer</li><li>Tempest Roar</li><li>The Basilisk</li><li>Vasily’s Prayer</li></ul><h4>Necromancer</h4><ul><li>Black River</li><li>Bloodless Scream</li><li>Deahtless Visage</li><li>Deathspeaker’s Pendant</li><li>Ebonpiercer</li><li>Gospel of the Devotee (New Unique)</li><li>Lidless Wall</li><li>Orphan Maker</li><li>Ring of Mendeln</li><li>Ring of the Sacrilegious Soul</li><li>The Hand of Naz</li><li>The Mortacrux</li><li>The Unmaker</li></ul><h4>Rogue</h4><ul><li>Beastfall Boots</li><li>Condemnation</li><li>Cowl of the Nameless</li><li>Deathmask of Nirmitruq</li><li>Grasp of Shadow</li><li>Orphan Maker (New Unique)</li><li>Pitfighter’s Gull</li><li>Saboteur’s Signet</li><li>Scoundrel’s Leathers</li><li>Shroud of Khanduras</li><li>Skyhunter</li><li>Word of Hakan</li></ul><h4>Sorcerer</h4><ul><li>Axial Conduit</li><li>Blue Rose</li><li>Esadora’s Overflowing Cameo</li><li>Flamescar</li><li>Fractured Winterglass</li><li>Galvanic Azurite (New Unique)</li><li>Ophidian Iris</li><li>Raiment of the Infinite</li><li>Staff of Endless Rage</li><li>Staff of Lam Esen</li><li>Starfall Coronet</li><li>Vox Omnium</li></ul><h4>Spiritborn</h4><ul><li>Balazan’s Maxtlatl</li><li>Band of First Breath</li><li>Harmony of Ebewaka</li><li>Hesha e Kesungi (New Unique)</li><li>Jacinth Shell</li><li>Loyalty’s Mantle</li><li>Peacemonger’s Signet</li><li>Ring of the Midday Hunt</li><li>Rod of Kepleke</li><li>Sunstained War-Crozier</li><li>Sepazontec</li><li>Wushe Nak Pa</li></ul><hr><h2>Seal Chaos Rifts</h2><ul><li>Chaos Rifts will appear in the open world of Sanctuary within Helltide.

                <p>Fans of old-school dungeon crawlers should get ready, because Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games have set a release date for the new psychological horror game Caput Mortum. This slow-burn horror adventure will officially launch on Steam on August 27.</p><p>This game drops players into an abandoned alchemist's tower from the 16th century and forces them to find a way out while confronting "stomach-turning secrets" and "death-defying horrors" that have been locked away for ages. Forbidden knowledge will also be discovered, assuming the players' characters live long enough to use it. The monsters in this game won't show any mercy, but there may be options beyond battling the creators or sneaking past them. However, healing items will be limited, so combat may not be the preferred path. You can check out a new Caput Mortum trailer below.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Caput Mortum - Official Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Caput Mortum was inspired by my first time playing [From Software's] King's Field 4 and the anxiety that comes with getting familiar with a game’s control scheme in a hostile environment," said WildArts Games art director Gabriel B. Dufour. "I also took inspiration from Amnesia: The Dark Descent when thinking about the monster encounters and puzzles. I hope fans of these classic games find something familiar to love in Caput Mortum, but that doesn't mean there won’t be surprises."</p><p>There are three different control options for Caput Mortum on PC. Keyboard-only and keyboard with a mouse are available for veteran players. However, the recommended option from Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games is to go with a controller to recreate the feeling of a classic dungeon-crawler. That option was modeled after the controls used in the original King's Field from 1994.</p><p>Caput Mortum's demo is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> ahead of the game's launch on August 27.</p>

                <p>As you browse Steam, adding various titles to your wishlist in the hopes they get a deep discount during the next big sale, you might soon notice that the pages for these games have a different look to them. Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">announced a new update</a> in the Steam client beta that changes how game pages look, with two major changes, the first being that store pages will be a lot wider.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole game page is wider in general, but the carousel containing trailers and screenshots will be a good bit wider too, allowing for some bigger images and videos. Because the whole page will be wider, Valve notes that there's more room to describe a game's features, so alongside the visual change you might start to notice some pages having more information than you're used to.</p><p dir="ltr">Arguably the biggest change with this Steam store page refresh is the ability to upload video files in the page's description section. A lot of game pages currently use animated GIFs to give an in-motion look at specific features or sections to better illustrate what the included text might not be able to. The problem with GIFs is that they aren't always the best quality, so allowing for videos will potentially mean clearer looks at specific parts of the games that might not work for a trailer. As long as there are no major hiccups, it's possible we'll see these changes rolled out for everyone in a few weeks time.</p><p dir="ltr">This comes as part of broader changes to Steam's storefront. Last month, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904590" rel="nofollow ">Valve released a beta version of the Steam home page</a>, making categories and tags personalized to you, a refresh of the browse tab, and additions to the search panel that shows recent popular searches, recently viewed games, and more. </p>
