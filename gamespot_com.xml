                <p>Next year marks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-25th-anniversary-year-will-be-really-special-phil-spencer-says/1100-6532334/" data-ref-id="1100-6532334">the 25th anniversary of Xbox</a>, but one of the console's original team members, Laura Fryer, is openly questioning one element of Microsoft's gaming division. Fryer--who no longer works for Xbox--recently shared her response to Microsoft's recent handheld and console partnerships and concluded that the company "has no desire" to create hardware anymore.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFG7YxFFCnY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her YouTube channel</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-is-dead-says-founding-team-member-it-looks-like-xbox-has-no-desire-or-literally-cant-ship-hardware-anymore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), Fryer noted that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a> won't have any exclusive games to drive sales and added that Microsoft's partnerships with Asus on the handheld and AMD on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">the next generation of Xbox</a> reflects a dim future for its consoles.</p><p>"Obviously, as one of the founding members of the Xbox team, I'm not pleased with where things are today," said Fryer. "I don't love watching all of the value that I helped create slowly get eroded away. I'm sad because, from my perspective, it looks like Xbox has no desire--or literally can't--ship hardware anymore. So, this partnership is about a slow exit from the hardware business completely. Personally, I think Xbox hardware is dead."</p><p>Fryer acknowledged that remasters of classic games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> have been massively successful, but she questioned Xbox's ability to make new hits. She also notes that Microsoft has a valuable resource in Game Pass, but believes that it's not enough to drive hardware sales on its own.</p><p>Former Xbox Live and Game Pass vice president Mike Ybarra had a slightly different assessment on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1939298865976647790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. While Ybarra also believes that Microsoft is pulling back from hardware, he thinks it can become the biggest gaming publisher if it focuses on that goal alone.</p><p>"They have to figure out what needs to change, and fast," wrote Ybarra. "I'm a big fan and will always bleed green... Pick your lane and stick to it... It's simple to me, Xbox should strive to be the world's largest publisher of entertainment content. Get rid of everything else and get focused. Do not be afraid to say what you are. Embrace the lane... Straddling the fence is not a winning plan."</p><p>A recent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-coming-soon/1100-6532671/" data-ref-id="1100-6532671">a new round of layoffs may hit Microsoft's gaming division</a> as soon as this week. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said multiple times that the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">needs to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business</a>. At the same time, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft's latest quarterly report</a> noted that net revenue the company achieved net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division also posted year-over-year revenue growth.</p>

                <p>Shortly after the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/backyard-baseball-97-review-hit-parade/1900-6418299/" data-ref-id="1900-6418299">Backyard Baseball '97</a> remaster in October 2024, Playground Productions and Mega Cat Studios revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">Backyard Baseball '01 will be one of the next remastered titles</a>. Now, the game has been set for a release date in early July, and Playground Productions has confirmed that 28 out of 31 MLB players from the original Backyard Baseball '01 will return for the remaster.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmNTH8ku6Hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MmNTH8ku6Hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The announcement didn't specify which of the three MLB players didn't lend their names and younger likenesses to Backyard Baseball '01's remaster. But some of the confirmed returning players include Cal Ripken, Jr., Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, Alex Rodriguez, and Derek Jeter.</p><p>In partnership with Major League Baseball, Backyard Baseball '01 will feature logos from MLB's professional teams in addition to the players representing the league. Like the earlier Backyard sports remasters, Backyard Baseball '01 will recreate the classic gameplay for touch and modern PC controls.</p><p>"We're honored to partner with MLB to bring this iconic game to modern gaming devices for the first time," said Playground Productions CEO Lindsay Barnett in a statement. "Backyard Baseball '01 was a game-changer in many ways--introducing some of the sport's biggest legends into the Backyard universe. We can't wait for fans to relive the joy of building their dream team with both our beloved original characters and baseball's greatest pros from that unforgettable era."</p><p>Backyard Baseball '01 will be released on PC via Steam and on mobile devices on July 8. The remaster of Backyard Baseball '97 was ported to Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5 last October. However, there's currently no word about whether Backyard Baseball '01 will eventually join it on consoles. </p>

The existence of Rush mode is no surprise, as it's one of the franchise's trademark multiplayer modes, but this is some of the first footage we're seeing of it in action.</p><p>This footage stems from a Battlefield Labs alpha test, and it was not meant to be published publicly since the alpha requires players to agree to not share footage online. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">this was hardly the first leak</a>. In any event, players are commenting that the leaked Rush footage looks pretty solid. In the video, we see a player in a tank causing all kinds of chaos.

Many commented that the footage was giving off Modern Warfare 2019 vibes. Specifically, some are saying the footage looks similar to Call of Duty's large-scale, 32 vs. 32 Ground War mode (<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Ground_War" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which itself took cues from the Battlefield series</a>).</p><p>Battlefield 6, which may or may not be what the game is actually called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reveal-still-happening-this-summer-ea-assures/1100-6532481/" data-ref-id="1100-6532481">set to be revealed sometime this summer</a>, but it remains to be seen exactly when.</p><p>The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>. That remains to be seen, however, and the company has said it's keen to avoid bringing the game to market too soon to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">help avoid having another Battlefield 2042 situation on its hands.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for the Battlefield Labs testing program</a> for a chance to try the game early. EA has said it's planning to expand the tests to more users over time, so if you didn't get in already, you might still have a chance for a future test.</p>
