From there, those looking to play together on different platforms will need to add each other's Larian account name to their in-game friend's list. Players will then be able to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby and invite people accordingly. One interesting wrinkle noted by Larian is that if the person hosting the lobby is playing on PC and joined by those playing on consoles or Mac, the lobby host will need to have less than 100 mods installed and only include mods accepted on consoles and Mac.</p><p dir="ltr">The real draw of the update, however, is the new subclasses. The full list of additions can be found below. Larian will be hosting a livestream on April 16 to go over all the new subclasses in more detail.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">College of Glamour Bard</li><li dir="ltr">Path of Giants Barbarian</li><li dir="ltr">Death Domain Cleric</li><li dir="ltr">Circle of The Stars Druid</li><li dir="ltr">Oath of the Crown Paladin</li><li dir="ltr">Arcane Archer Fighter</li><li dir="ltr">Drunken Master Monk</li><li dir="ltr">Swarmkeeper Ranger</li><li dir="ltr">Swashbuckler Rogue</li><li dir="ltr">Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li><li dir="ltr">Hexblade Warlock</li><li dir="ltr">Bladesinging Wizard</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Baldur's Gate 3's previous content update, Patch 7, arrived in September 2024 and added an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-official-modding-toolkit-in-upcoming-patch-7/1100-6523885/" data-ref-id="1100-6523885">official mod toolkit</a> and in-game mod manager, as well as "evil" endings, UI updates, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Those waiting to hear more about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-fans-wont-have-long-to-wait-to-find-out-the-future-of-the-franchise/1100-6530188/" data-ref-id="1100-6530188">future of the Baldur's Gate franchise seemingly won't have to wait long</a>, as a Hasbro executive said it's currently working on plans for what's next and will have more to talk about in "pretty short order." Whatever comes next for the series, it won't be from Larian. The developer has already stated its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>, won't be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Baldur's Gate 4</a> but rather something new.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> seem like they could be the most technically ambitious games coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. But neither surprised Digital Foundry as much as Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws--an open-world title that is current-gen only and never arrived on PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Digital Foundry technology editor Richard Leadbetter opened up the discussion about Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 on this week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">DF Direct</a> podcast (seen below). "I think this one's quite surprising, to be honest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>," said Leadbetter. "This is like a technologically demanding game on the new Snowdrop engine for Ubisoft Massive. The concept that it's running on this class of hardware is pretty mind-blowing, I'd say."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZZAr1c0Wqg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leadbetter wasn't alone, as the rest of the crew seemed quite intrigued by Ubisoft bringing Star Wars Outlaws to Switch 2. In fact, Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it "a really exciting port, possibly an impossible port, if you will." That's because it's such a large game utilizing features like ray tracing. Plus, there isn't say a PS4 edition, while other third-party titles like Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6 did come to last-gen consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that led to Digital Foundry video producer ​​Alex Battaglia saying, "This is by far the most technically ambitious game that we've seen mentioned as having been ported to Switch 2, like by far." The crew believes the Xbox Series S version of Star Wars Outlaws could give us a clue of what to expect on Nintendo's upcoming system. However, Leadbetter noted how Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora struggled when he played that on an Asus ROG Ally, since both games share the Snowdrop engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws originally launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in August and follows the adventures of Kay Vess in the Outer Rim. Ubisoft has continued to overhaul the game since release, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">dropping forced stealth</a>. Star Wars Outlaws has also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/landos-back-in-star-wars-outlaw-wild-card-launch-trailer/1100-6527960/">story DLC in which you get to team up with Lando Calrissian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 yet, though it is planned to arrive this year.

Along the way, players will unlock various outfits that have special abilities that'll let Nikki progress through the open world. It's filled with 3D platforming elements, puzzles, and minigames for players to engage with.</p><p>Despite its cute and glitzy exterior, the lore behind Miraland is surprisingly gloomy. Around 1,000 years ago, Miraland was embroiled in the War of Heavens against an evil force called The Dark, which sowed chaos and ultimately caused Miraland's destruction. In the present, The Dark are still around in the form of Esselings, which are hostile creatures made up of old pieces of clothing tainted by the Dark Essence.</p><p>Infinity Nikki is free-to-play and currently available on PS5, mobile, and Windows.
