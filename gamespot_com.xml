                <p dir="ltr">Just a little more than a year after releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/" data-ref-id="5000-572199">Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</a>, Activision is ending its support for the game, which includes removing it from the Apple App Store and Google Play stores.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision made the announcement with a written statement on <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1923468603959259556" rel="nofollow ">X (formerly Twitter)</a>. "Going forward, we will be streamlining the scope of the game," Activision wrote. May 18 is the last day the game will be available for download from Apple and Google's stores, and Activision has ended the ability of players to purchase Call of Duty points or Black Cell in the game "effective immediately." Social features are also being retired.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Activision said servers will still be available for players who have already downloaded the game--in essence, while you can't download Warzone Mobile after this weekend or buy anything in it, you'll still be able to play. Activision didn't say if or when servers for Warzone Mobile would be shut down.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players who have the game installed before Monday, May 19, 2025 will still have access to the game with continued cross-progression of shared inventories using existing content, and servers with matchmaking for online play," Activision wrote. "Any unspent COD Points can also be redeemed in-game toward available content in the Store."</p><p dir="ltr">However, according to <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" rel="nofollow ">Activision's support website for Warzone Mobile</a>, future Warzone content will not be available in Warzone Mobile. Activision also won't be offering refunds to players who purchased CoD Points or Black Cell in Warzone Mobile.</p><p dir="ltr">"This decision was made after careful consideration of various factors and while we're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences," the statement says.</p><p dir="ltr">While that effectively means that support for Warzone Mobile seems to be coming to an end, GameSpot understands that Activision's Warzone Mobile teams are moving forward on other projects.</p>
