                <p>For the better part of a decade, French gaming developers Laurent Lechat and Boris Marmontel had their game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/planet-centauri/" data-ref-id="5000-453058">Planet Centauri </a>in early access on Steam. However, the game's 1.0 launch arrived last year with a resounding thud, and Valve is accepting the blame for not notifying the 100,000-plus players who had wishlisted it on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBf5mZFUbpU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hBf5mZFUbpU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a recent post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1nfd2ji/this_is_how_steam_can_ruin_more_than_10_years_of/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valve-steam-alpha-centauri-launch-bug-daily-deal-terraria/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>), Lechat shared excerpts from an email sent out by Valve that explained why Planet Centauri's launch failed to get much traction.</p><p>"We found a bug that impacted a very small number of game releases (less than 100 since 2015) where wishlist email notifications for the launch of a game were not sent," wrote a Valve spokesperson. "Unfortunately, your game Planet Centauri was among those included. We intend for this feature to work for every game and we're inviting you to a Daily Deal as a way to help make up for lost visibility from your launch day."</p><p>Lechat explained at length how the dismal response to Planet Centauri disheartened himself and Marmontel. He also seemed wary about Valve's offer before other users on Reddit urged them to accept the added visibility of a Daily Deal on Steam's homepage.</p><p>Since Planet Centauri's story has been making the rounds, there has been a small uptick of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/385380/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">concurrent players to 105</a>. That's not a huge number, but some players have given the game a shot and shared largely positive reviews. Although some of the other reviews on Steam have noted that <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/twilightdusk/recommended/385380/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Planet Centauri has noticeable flaws</a> and still feels like an early-access release.</p><p>Lechat and Marmontel are currently working on a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roguelike-games/2900-6522/" data-ref-id="2900-6522">roguelike game</a> that uses the engine they built for Planet Centauri. The duo said that they have a financial obligation to finish that game before they'll be free to work on future patches for Planet Centauri.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Team Ninja <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-revealed-at-state-of-play-free-demo-out-today/1100-6532108/" data-ref-id="1100-6532108">debuted the first look</a> at a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nioh-3/" data-ref-id="5000-680916">Nioh 3</a>, the latest game in the action-RPG series. Players will assume control of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo, as he rises to power by taking on supernatural threats. In a departure for the series, Tokugawa can switch back and forth between samurai and ninja fighting styles. Now, Team Ninja has explained how its Ninja Gaiden games inspired this shift in Nioh 3's gameplay.</p><p>"We wanted to create a new kind of action that would act as a major centerpiece, making players feel that the game has taken a step forward," said Nioh 3 general producer Fumihiko Yasuda during an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nioh-3-is-changing-the-game-with-ninja-style-and-the-distinctive-mist-system-ign-first" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Team Ninja also has the experience of creating the Ninja Gaiden series. In other words, we have just about as much experience and knowhow when it comes to creating ninja action as we do with Nioh's samurai action. Ninja are very popular overseas, and we thought that this would excite those players as well. Nioh's Japanese world and setting is also something we value, which made ninja seem like the best possible answer."</p><p>Yasuda noted that previous Nioh games have already referenced the Ninja Gaiden games in the DLC, but added that Team Ninja is looking "into creating the sort of action that fans of both series will enjoy."</p><p>Players will can favor one fighting style over another, although there will be key differences between them. Samurai style will allow players to use Ki Pulse after attacking to recover their stamina. However, that ability won't be available to players using ninja style. Instead, ninja style players can use the mist ability to temporarily create a duplicate of themselves to better strike at their enemies. </p><p>Nioh 3 is currently expected to hit PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2026. In the meantime, Team Ninja's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/" data-ref-id="5000-659496">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, is coming on October 21 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. That sequel was also co-developed by Platinum Games.</p>
