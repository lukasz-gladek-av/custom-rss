                <p>The second weekend of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> is now in full swing, and Battlefield Studios isn't wasting time when it comes to making some adjustments to the game's Rush mode.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced by the official <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms account on X</a>, MCOM timers on Rush have been reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to "better balance between attacking and defending players." Additionally, respawn timers have been adjusted on both Rush and Breakthrough so that defender respawns are now fixed at 12 seconds, having previously been between 6-12 seconds. One other change on Breakthrough makes it so fewer players are needed on an objective in order to speed up the capture time.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Balance Changes to Breakthrough and Rush<br>We’ve just made some balancing changes: In Breakthrough, it now takes fewer players on an objective to speed up capture. Also, defender respawn timers in both Breakthrough and Rush are now fixed at 12 seconds instead of the previous 6-12…</p>  — Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956355268972867585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Those changes should help attackers on Rush and Breakthrough claim more sectors, but so far Battlefield Studios hasn't addressed the main elephant in the room when it comes to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">Rush--its small 12v12 size</a> and a complete lack of vehicles.</p><p dir="ltr">Previous iterations of Rush typically featured 16v16 players and included vehicles, something Battlefield 6's version does not have. Combined with the smaller sizes of the maps featured in the Battlefield 6 beta, and this iteration of Rush doesn't seem to have won over many fans, with one longtime <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield content creator</a> stating he would rather see the mode removed until it's "been properly worked on," citing poor map balance.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may alleviate some of the issues fans have had with Rush in Battlefield 6, something that one of the game's producers said the full game will have. Battlefield 6 will launch with a total of nine maps, four of which are currently playable in the second open beta weekend.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the Rush complaints and some issues revolving around its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enabling-secure-boot-for-battlefield-6-is-turning-into-a-nightmare-for-some/1100-6533811/" data-ref-id="1100-6533811">Secure Boot requirement on PC</a>, Battlefield 6's beta has already been a big success, surpassing both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a> and that of previous Battlefield games on Steam. The Battlefield 6 open beta ends August 17.</p>

                <p>Online collaborative pixel art platform Wplace has had many users drawing images from video games, but it's also being used as a platform for video game-related protests.</p><p dir="ltr">Heavily inspired by r/place on Reddit, users can paint any location of the world map with pixels of any color, which has inspired some people to air their grievances through pixel art. As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-fans-paint-savehytale-art-over-riot-games-office-on-wplace-protesting-its-cancellation" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, the location of Riot Games' headquarters in Santa Monica has been targeted with a large art piece accompanied with the message "#SaveHytale" and the Hytale logo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOXtd-WzRxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xOXtd-WzRxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Riot Games is the owner of the studio Hypixel, which announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-inspired-sandbox-game-hytale-canceled-after-a-decade-of-development/1100-6532646/">cancellation of the Minecraft-inspired sandbox game</a> in June after a decade of development. The developer had also announced the winding down of operations.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Dragon Age fans have also taken to Wplace to protest EA (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-age-remastered-trilogy-cancelled-by-ea-fans-angry-messages-on-wplace/" rel="nofollow ">TheGamer</a>) following reports that that proposals for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/">remaster of the Dragon Age Trilogy had been rejected</a> by the publisher. Instead of targeting EA's headquarters, fans have taken over the Scottish town of Kirkwall in the Orkney Islands, sharing the same name as the city in Dragon Age 2, where pixel art of Dragon Age fan art and "F--k EA" messages can be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Wplace is a collaborative pixel art project created by Murilo Matsubara, and since its launch on July 21, anyone can paint on the world map made up of four trillion pixels. While users start with just a limit of 30 pixels, 1 pixel is recovered every 30 seconds.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 10 will introduce a new, more powerful type of Unique item called Chaos Armor that will take an existing Unique and convert it into a different armor slot, opening up even more build possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed the new item type in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> ahead of Diablo 4 Season 10's upcoming PTR playtest, where it also dove into details on how the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-diablo-4-season-10-ptr-is-shaking-up-infernal-hordes/1100-6533978/" data-ref-id="1100-6533978">shaking up its Infernal Hordes</a> endgame activity.</p><p dir="ltr">A Chaos Armor Unique item will always appear at maximum power and have at least one greater affix, often making them stronger than the normal version of that Unique. But the fact that they are stronger isn't the biggest change. Normally, Uniques are just that: unique. Each Unique has only ever been available for one armor slot. If you found a Fists of Fate, that item is specifically for the glove slot. If you found a Razorplate, that is specifically a piece of chest armor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550267"></a><figcaption>An example of a Chaos Armor version of the Banished Lord's Talisman Unique.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550267-diablo4chaosarmoruniqueexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not the case with Chaos Armor, which takes an existing Unique item and makes it so it has a chance to appear as an item for another gear slot. Instead of a chestpiece, a Chaos Armor Razorplate could be a helm, for example, or Fists of Fate could be a pair of boots instead. The change opens up new builds for Diablo 4's classes in a huge way, allowing players to create new combinations of Unique items that weren't previously possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There are really only two downsides to Chaos Armor. One is that you can't equip a Chaos Armor version of a Unique and the original Unique at the same time (which you probably wouldn't want to do anyways), and the second is that there won't be Chaos Armor versions for an item's originally intended gear slot. Once again using Razorplate as an example, that means if your thorn build currently uses Razorplate in the chest slot, you won't be able to snag a Chaos Armor Razorplate for that same slot to serve as a slightly better version of what you were already using. Instead, you'll have to get creative and come up with some new item options for whatever slot that Unique previously occupied.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, finding new Uniques will be even easier in Season 10 as well, as Blizzard also outlined how it's improving loot drops. Unique items will have a higher chance to drop across all difficulties, and Magic and Rare items will no longer appear as rewards from Whispers or quests when playing on Torment difficulty. Helltide reward quality will also be increased, meaning increased chances of being able to gain Uniques from the event's caches.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 10 is slated to begin September 23, but it doesn't appear to bring many of the major changes that both Blizzard and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Diablo content creators have recently teased</a>. Meanwhile, Diablo 4's second expansion won't be coming until 2026, though a recent leak suggests it could finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">add Paladin as a playable class</a>.</p>
