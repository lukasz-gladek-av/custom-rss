                <p>Spooky season is hitting its conclusion, which makes this a great time to take advantage of a couple of Fanatical bundles that offer a bunch of spooky games.

Leading the pack is <strong>Amnesia: The Bunker</strong>, one of the scariest games to come out in a while. It locks you in a World War I bunker with a horrific, mutated creature, tasking you with finding your way out while continually powering a generator to keep the lights on and stay alive. You've also got <strong>Death Stranding</strong>, Kojima Productions' post-apocalyptic vision of an America infested by killer ghosts, and <strong>Hard West II</strong>, an XCOM-like turn-based strategy game set in a paranormal Old West.</p><p>The Prestige bundle features 16 games, and the more you buy, the cheaper the individual price on each one. Bundle two games together and you'll pay $15, or $7.50 for each; push it up to three games and the price drops to $7.33 each; and with five or more games, you'll pay only $7 each. That means you can grab five games for $35, or the entire bundle for $112, which would normally cost $408 if you paid retail for all of them. Check out the full list of games in the Prestige bundle below.</p><h2>Fanatical Prestige: Thriller Edition 2024</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: The Bunker</li><li dir="ltr">Bramble: The Mountain King</li><li dir="ltr">Chernobylite Complete Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</li><li dir="ltr">Dome Keeper Deluxe Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Faith: The Unholy Trinity</li><li dir="ltr">Graven</li><li dir="ltr">Hands of Necromancy II</li><li dir="ltr">Hard West II</li><li dir="ltr">Intravenous II</li><li dir="ltr">Laika: Aged Through Blood</li><li dir="ltr">Postal: Brain Damaged</li><li dir="ltr">Prey for the Gods</li><li dir="ltr">Remnant Records</li><li dir="ltr">Showgunners</li><li dir="ltr">Them and Us</li></ul><hr><p>Meanwhile, if you're looking for more of an action vibe, check out the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-supreme-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbuild-a-halloween-playlist-of-thriller-games-with-two-fanatical-bundles%2F1100-6527520%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Supreme Collection</a>, which has fewer specifically scary games, but still offers some great options for a variety of high-octane experiences.</p><p>The Supreme Collection offers a few more shooters, like <strong>Robocop: Rogue City</strong>, <strong>Wild Bastards</strong>, and<strong> Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</strong>. You can also get some more lighthearted experiences if you want some counterprogramming to the usual Halloween haunts. <strong>Payday 3</strong> lets you pull off heists with your friends (and mostly get into ridiculous shootouts with the cops), <strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong> is a funny and satirical Souls-like set under the sea, and <strong>Squirrel with a Gun</strong> is about a woodland creature's hilarious rampage.</p><p>But spooky options are on the table as well, specifically with <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>. It mixes first-person shooter mechanics with a Japanese setting filled with incredibly creepy creatures and spirits--excellent for those who like a Halloween feel without big scares.</p><p>The Supreme Collection bundle has newer titles than the Prestige collection, resulting in prices that are a little higher--but you can bring them down by bundling more games together. You can grab two games for $24, or $12.50 apiece; for three games, you'll pay $36, or $12 each; and five games will run you $55, or $11 each. As with other Fanatical bundles, you can grab as many games as you want and keep the $11 apiece price for all of them. With 23 games available in the bundle, you'll pay $187 for the lot, down from the retail price of $593 for all of them.
