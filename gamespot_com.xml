Unfortunately, preorders for this LRG-exclusive version ended on October 5.</p><p>High on Life 2 looks like it picks up where the original left off, featuring similar first-person shooter gameplay with a cast of talking guns and out-of-this-world characters. There are, of course, new gameplay elements to look forward to, including a rideable skateboard, which you'll use to traverse around the city and surrounding areas while you battle through the game's missions.</p><p>If you're looking to catch up on the original High on Life before the sequel, you can grab the physical High on Life: Game of the Year Edition, which was also produced by Limited Run Games.

                <p>For a minute there, a full-on remake of Obsidian Entertainment's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith/" data-ref-id="5000-20453">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</a> was apparently in development. However, the project appears to have been put on hold, according to a new report.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File's reporting</a>, new legal documents revealed that Aspyr and Lucasfilm Games were working on a full remake of KOTOR 2. Codenamed "Juliet" in the files, the project was a modern remake of the iconic 2004 RPG and was in development alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-537792">KOTOR remake</a>, which developer Saber Interactive said is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-is-still-coming-says-developer/1100-6526585/" data-ref-id="1100-6526585">still coming</a>. However, per Game File and unlike the KOTOR remake, development on the KOTOR II remake has ceased as recently as March 2025. Lucasfilm Games VP Douglas Reilly explained in depositions about the drama surrounding KOTOR II that, had the remake come to fruition, it would've contained the cut DLC that was teased when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-kotor-2-with-restored-content-launches-for-switch-june-8/1100-6503963/" data-ref-id="1100-6503963">the game was announced for Nintendo Switch in 2022</a>.</p><p>"'Juliet' was the codename for a project where we were going to do a full remake of KOTOR II," Reilly said. [It would have featured] modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general--the general content of KOTOR II, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr. ... The plan was that we would remake the content that was in the RCM as it relates to Star Wars in that Juliet project."</p><p>The DLC, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=485537937" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Sith Lords Restored Content Modification</a> (or RCM), was originally a mod that filled in the narrative gaps while offering an alternate ending for KOTOR 2. As Aspyr officially revealed the restored content announcement, the studio confirmed that the official DLC would do the same thing: It would include new crew dialogue, an extra mission with HK-47, and a "new revamped ending." Unfortunately, when KOTOR 2 hit Nintendo Switch on June 8, 2022, the DLC never came out. Apparently, the reason why the DLC never dropped was that Disney's lawyers blocked it with what was apparently a sticking point surrounding who actually made the mod. And now, it appears a KOTOR 2 remake won't drop, either.</p>

                <p>Pokemon cards are as hot as they've ever been, and unfortunately for a local card shop in California, it means their merchandise was the target of a recent heist. On December 2, thieves targeted LA Sports Cards in Burbank and made off with $100,000 or more in Pokemon cards and other collectibles. The trio of thieves were captured on camera in KTLA 5's video report below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C1e1em0hqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_C1e1em0hqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Store owner Kiet Nguyen noted that the thieves seemed to know just where to go to get the most valuable Pokemon cards in the store. "Liquid assets" of unopened Pokemon boxes were also taken, and will be easy to sell because of how common they are. Additionally, the thieves stole rare sports cards that featured Mickey Mantle and Ronaldo among others.</p><p>The thieves were in and out of the store in around three minutes, and the report notes that this trio may have hit other card shops in Southern California. One of the thieves exposed part of his face during an earlier heist, and that could help police eventually track him and his partners down.</p><p>KTLA notes that Nguyen indicated that the store does have insurance, and it will be upgrading its security. It's not the first time that Pokemon cards have been linked to crime. In late 2024, reports emerged that the Japanese mob was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using Pokemon cards to launder money</a>.</p><p>Law-abiding Pokemon fans are keeping an eye on the next Switch 2 game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a>, which will be released on March 5, 2026.
