                <p dir="ltr"><em>Chrono Trigger is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, March 11, 2025. Below, we explore how its innovative New Game Plus feature set it apart as an all-time classic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I spent almost an entire summer vacation repeatedly replaying Chrono Trigger. At the peak of the dog days, when I was content to stay indoors with the air conditioning (and my parents were content to let me), I was completing a full playthrough every few days. This was a welcome proposition thanks to New Game Plus, which still stands as a major part of Chrono Trigger's legacy and a critical, irremovable piece of its brilliant design.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was not the first game to feature an optional way to continue playing after beating the game. Other games, like The Legend of Zelda, featured second quests or post-credits challenges. But Chrono Trigger did coin the term New Game Plus, and it popularized the idea as it's currently understood. As opposed to an extra challenge for those who had mastered the game, Chrono Trigger's NG+ allowed you to start the game again with all of your experience, skills, and any items or equipment that wasn't critical to the plot. Rather than challenge you to complete a second quest with your newfound mastery, it rewarded you by making the game easier and faster--a breezy romp through a story you already knew and probably loved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654"></a><figcaption>New Game Plus in Chrono Trigger | Image credit: Thonky.com</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to understand this innovation in its context. Before we were awash in too many games to count or those indefinitely expanding with new content, most of us were replaying relatively short single-player games regularly. RPGs were a heavier lift, because they demanded so much of your time. Replaying an RPG wasn't unheard of, but it was a commitment. Squaresoft cleverly found a simple way to remove the high time and commitment barrier and allow players to play RPGs over again easily.</p><p dir="ltr">Put simply, Square recognized that persistent progression is a major component in our enjoyment of RPGs. Unlike a game like Super Mario World, which is primarily about playing and testing platforming skills, RPG players form close connections with their parties and builds, from their chosen skills to equipment to decisions and relationships. Shaking the Etch-a-Sketch clean just feels different for an RPG, and while it can certainly be enjoyable to start an RPG over with a completely fresh slate, it can be even more satisfying to keep your powerful characters intact and breeze through encounters that previously gave you some trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was an especially great testing ground for this novel concept. The time-traveling RPG famously sported <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Chrono_Trigger_endings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple endings</a>. These were based primarily on your decision of when and how to confront Lavos, an ancient evil that laid in wait, infesting the world for millions of years before ushering in doomsday in the distant future. To even attempt to take on Lavos early would require a party advanced well past the point that would be realistic for players to have early in the game. Jumping throughout time and experimenting with engaging Lavos at different points was both a plot payoff and only functionally possible through New Game Plus.</p><p>The multiple endings were a major draw meant to support multiple playthroughs, as many of them gave you a better understanding of the world and its events, the unfortunate consequences of action or inaction, and the many ultimate destinies of its cast. Some characters' fates were immutable no matter what you did. Others could be changed in small ways that impacted their lives. Still others could have major ramifications on the world. Seeing all of these timelines intertwined and in communication with each other makes the whole experience richer and more textured. The New Game Plus feature was an important tool, making it hassle-free to keep experimenting and discovering new possibilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsflIgDpvhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsflIgDpvhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>On a metatextual level, the time-traveling conceit implied, even if it did not overtly recognize, the idea of cyclical patterns. Perhaps the new Crono whose mom woke him up to meet his friend at the Millennial Fair really had lived a thousand lives before and become a powerful warrior ready to defeat a world-ending alien. It makes a certain degree of intuitive sense even if the story doesn't directly call attention to it.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the best platforming games, the flexibility of the system allowed players to invent their own fun. The heady summer I spent replaying Chrono Trigger, I set the goal to keep replaying until I had a full array of Prism armor for every character--an extremely powerful and limited item that can only be obtained once per playthrough. Achieving that goal may not have been necessary, but it felt uniquely satisfying in a way that was only made possible by New Game Plus.</p><p dir="ltr">While Chrono Trigger deserves plaudits as the game to coin and popularize New Game Plus as a mechanic, it has also retained its title as one of the best examples of it, even decades later. Many games have been content to offer the option to replay with your gear intact, but Chrono Trigger had the vision to weave it into the narrative and make it an integral part of the experience. Playing it two or more times isn't an optional nice-to-have; it's core to the designers' intent.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger is an impeccably designed RPG in many ways, from the lovable characters and beautiful art design to its stirring score. It certainly deserves to be remembered for all of those reasons and more. But perhaps the reason it stands out in the collective memories of so many RPG fans of my generation is because it was the first game of its kind to invite us to experience all of those elements over and over again, strengthening our memories and creating new ones every time.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Some hardcore PC game genres have had a renaissance in recent years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> reinvigorated love for the CPRG, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> tapped into a communal love for hardcore first-person RPGs that hadn't been satiated in a while. Not all classic PC gaming genres have been so lucky. We've yet to see a new stealth-tactics game like Commandos or a dungeon management game like Dungeon Keeper become a breakout hit. That's not for lack of trying, as games like Desperados 3 and Evil Genius 2: World Domination have kept the legacy of these genres going, albeit in a way that has stayed niche. Kuuasema's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cthulhu-keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-663255">Cthulhu Keeper</a> aims to resurrect these struggling genres and become that surprise success.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is a real-time tactics game split into two parts: One half sees players building up their home base of operations and defending it from intruders, while the other sees the player command cultists and Lovecraftian monsters with special abilities to complete stealth missions. I had the chance to go hands-on with Cthulhu Keeper exclusively following its reveal last month, and I found it to be an entertaining hybrid of those classic PC game genres.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZ7OQEMCk8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LuZ7OQEMCk8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The version of Cthulhu Keeper I played didn't have much narrative content, although the eldritch theming still emanated from everything I played. There's no shortage of Lovecraftian video games out there, but the distinct perspective of Cthulhu Keeper helps it stand out. As I hear my subjects say, "Yes, master" after I give them commands during stealth missions and slowly amass power by building my cult's compound, I feel like a puppet master in the way Cthulhu and other horrors often are in Lovecraftian tales.</p><p dir="ltr">That vibe remains strong when I'm commanding minions within my cult compound, digging out areas so I can build altars, libraries, and other structures to increase my power and defend against potential intruders. Then, when intruders arrived--they ranged from genuine snoopers to a lovey-dovey couple who ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time--I could see everything I built work in harmony to keep those invaders at bay.</p><p dir="ltr">Management games like Two Point Museum are good fun, but I appreciate how Cthulhu Keeper is more in tune with the gameplay loop that made Dungeon Keeper such a classic. This cult compound gameplay is the backbone of Cthulhu Keeper, but building defenses or earning upgrades does require resources. To earn those resources, I had to venture out and complete stealth missions around the world. This part of Cthulhu Keeper is what plays more like Commandos, or contemporary examples like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/desperados-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-486056">Desperados 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sumerian-six/" data-ref-id="5000-631984">Sumerian Six</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stealth missions took two different forms. There are story missions that serve as the set piece levels, while expeditions were mini-roguelite runs where I had to strategically get my units through a series of smaller encounters as unscathed as possible. I love stealth-tactics games because they reward my smart planning but also require me to think on my toes based on how enemies react to my actions.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper does not reinvent this style of gameplay; I still have to delicately choose where to place my units to navigate around enemy vision cones and smartly utilize each unit's abilities to kill enemies or open up opportunities to move past a unit without getting spotted. Player units are fragile, so I wasn't successful in Cthulhu Keeper whenever I tried to run and gun through a scenario.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lovecraftian twists Cthulhu Keeper applies to this tried-and-true formula do provide a unique flair within the stealth-tactics space. When I started missions, I only had one unit to command: Lilith West, a corrupted neurobiologist. Lilith could stealthily kill an enemy just fine, but she doesn't have much in the way of offensive abilities. Instead, her skills focused on increasing the number of units at my disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">After killing an enemy, I could harvest their corpse to get an eyeball or choose to reanimate them. The former would allow me to see an enemy's vision cone and surroundings even if they were out of my sightline, while the latter would create a whole new unit I could use to attack enemies or damage the sanity of civilians scattered throughout each level. Once I terrified a civilian, I could have Lilith use her Enlighten ability to turn them into a unit under my command.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These units couldn't kill enemies but were useful for scouting areas or temporarily stunning enemies so I could get past them. Occasionally, I would encounter a pylon in a level and destroy it to summon eldritch monsters. These monsters were the units that could tear through enemy forces, but even then, I had to carefully manage their health to ensure they did not die. That was particularly tough in the lengthy story mission, as I could no longer rely on quickly running to an encounter's exit to move on.</p><p dir="ltr">Even from this light smattering of encounters, I'm already enjoying the stealth-tactics part of Cthulhu Keeper as much as I enjoy games like Desperados 3. When a game juggles two different genres of gameplay, it risks becoming a jack of all trades but a master of none. I did not get that feeling while playing Cthulhu Keeper, as I found it to provide equally polished and engaging takes on stealth-tactics and dungeon-defending gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also a solid entry point to both of these hardcore genres. The menus and currencies required to build out the cult compound aren't overly complex. Meanwhile, the bite-sized encounters of expeditions should make learning the intricacies of stealth tactics less overwhelming and reliant on save-scumming. Cthulhu Keeper could reanimate PC gaming genres that have struggled to have a breakout hit in recent years, Lovecraftian-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is in development for PC. A public playtest for the game will begin on March 17.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In less than two weeks, a new cooperative horror game called REPO on Steam has gone from 7,000 concurrent players to hitting over 145,000 users on Valve's platform (per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3241660/charts/#max" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>). To call the online-multiplayer experience a surprise hit is probably an understatement. This is only the second title from developer Semiwork, which previously created <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304680/Voidigo/" rel="nofollow ">Voidigo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">REPO</a>re stands for retrieve, extract, and profit operation. As such, up to six people work together in the online cooperative game to attain valuable items as quietly as possible. That's easier than it sounds in the physics-based horror game, especially in a group setting with a "grabbing tool." But there are monsters listening and waiting to make everything even more chaotic.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OQ-kPtObmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="176">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1OQ-kPtObmQ?start=176" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Semiwork has called the burst in popularity for REPO "quite the experience," as it's the first time the studio has utilized the Unity engine as well as made an online multiplayer game. The developer is busy with new features, enemies, and levels for the horror game--as well as addressing bugs. Additionally, Semiwork is trying to figure out the best way to address hackers without implementing anti-cheat systems, since that could negatively affect players using mods.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, a couple of fun codes were dished out by Semiwork about REPO. For example, typing "/cinematic" in the text chat will remove the UI. Additionaly, the developer says you can put "/greenscreen" into the chat for that feature to pop up in-game.</p><p dir="ltr">REPO is $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3241660/REPO/" rel="nofollow ">Steam Early Access</a>. The online cooperative horror game launched February 26.</p>

[Games development in-house] is something we're building up," he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f4944f4-8255-4115-8838-d2bde03588cf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FT</a>.</p><p>Many of the existing Lego games are made by external studios via a licensing arrangement. For example, Lego works with the UK studio <a href="https://www.ttgames.com/games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TT Games</a> on the popular Lego games based on brands like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, and Pirates of the Caribbean.</p><p>Lego is also in business with Epic Games for the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297"> Lego Fortnite game inside the Fortnite platform.</a> Additionally, Lego partnered with 2K for a racing game, 2023's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-2k-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-585043">Lego 2K Drive</a>. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lego-is-starting-to-bring-its-game-development-in-house-key-exec-says/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, this was the first in a series of sports games to come from this deal.</p><p>Reporter Jason Schreier said TT Games is now<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4?t=2997s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> developing a new Lego game</a> that could potentially release later in 2025 or in 2026. VGC reported that an upcoming Lego Harry Potter game may be in the works and could follow a similar format to Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga and cover the entire Harry Potter series. 2024's Lego Harry Potter Collection already did this, with the bundle comprising Lego Harry Potter Years 1-4 and Lego Harry Potter Years 5-7. Warner Bros. Games is making major changes going forward and will focus only on a few core franchises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wbs-gaming-struggles-come-into-focus/1100-6529747/" data-ref-id="1100-6529747">Harry Potter being one of them. </a></p><p>Another new release in the Lego game series was 2024's Lego Horizon Adventures, which adapted the events of Sony's Horizon series. Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo developed this title.</p><p>There is basically nothing to go on beyond Christiansen's single-sentence quote about potentially making games in-house, so it's not clear why the company might make this change, when it could happen, or if anything will change with Lego's ongoing business partnerships with outside studios.</p>

                <p>Wargaming, the developer behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-tanks/" data-ref-id="5000-69356">World of Tanks</a>, confirmed that its new mech shooter Steel Hunters will enter early access on April 2.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steel-hunters/" data-ref-id="5000-654971">Steel Hunters</a> was revealed at The Game Awards 2024. It's quite different from the military-focused multiplayer games Wargaming is best known for, such as World of Tanks, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warships/" data-ref-id="5000-114101">World of Warships</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warplanes/" data-ref-id="5000-107489">World of Warplanes</a>. Steel Hunters fully embraces sci-fi as a mecha game that blends elements from hero shooters, battle royales, and extraction shooters. Five teams of two players fight each other to collect a resource called Starfall on Earth, and players can win by killing all of their opponents or successfully extracting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1_2h0I6wvY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N1_2h0I6wvY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When Steel Hunters enters early access, it will include seven different "Hunters" for players to choose from: Razerside, Heartbreaker, Fenris, Ursus, Trenchwalker, Prophet, and Weaver. Three maps scattered around Earth--Crimson Ridge, Maryland Heights, and Stonecutter Keeper--will also be part of Steel Hunters from the start of Early Access.</p><p>Wargaming <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691340/STEEL_HUNTERS/?curator_clanid=32977250" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained in a Steam post</a> that it chose to put Steel Hunters through early access because it allows the developers and players to "we can refine and expand the game together, ensuring every shot fired and every Hunter unleashed is finely tuned." While Wargaming has not outlined a specific early access timeline, it also explained that the studio's goal "is to move quickly to a full release once your feedback has helped us polish the core experience."</p><p>Steel Hunters' early-access period will begin on April 2, exclusively on PC. It will be available on both Steam and the Wargaming Game Center storefronts.</p>
