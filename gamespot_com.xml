                <p>Mega Evolutions are making their grand return in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and after seeing how Dragonite, Victreebel, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-makes-hawlucha-look-like-the-ultimate-luchador/1100-6534339/">Hawlucha</a> will look once they've undergone this power-up, it looks like Malamar is also getting an upgrade. So far, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company have released Mega Evolution reveal videos that put an interesting spin on the world of Pokemon, and just like the Victreebel Mega Evolution, this satirical news broadcast is a reminder of just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-goes-full-blair-witch-project-to-reveal-a-brand-new-mega-evolution/1100-6534163/">how frightening the world would be if Pokemon were real</a>.</p><p>In the video, Mega Malar uses its hypnotic abilities on the citizens of Lumiose City, explaining why there has been a boom in popularity for it. Mega Malamar is also slimmed down in comparison to its base form, as this Dark- and Psychic-type Pokemon gets a big boost to its mental powers. Does psychic power burn a lot of calories? <em>Maybe</em>, according to pseudo-science.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HxSr_6RiiY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4HxSr_6RiiY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Malamar’s brain has become enlarged as a result of Mega Evolution," its official Pokedex entry reads. "Greatly enhanced psychic power overflows from its body, emitting a bright glow. Mega Malamar views others--even Pokémon Trainers--as its pawns. If it disagrees with an order given to it by a Trainer, it will sometimes respond by hypnotizing them, making this an incredibly difficult Pokemon to interact with.</p><p>Ahead of its release on October 16 for Switch 2 and Switch, Pokemon fans in Mexico can also attend a special event for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-celebrates-upcoming-launch-with-lucha-libre-showdown/1100-6534371/">that will feature live lucha libre wrestling</a>. The new Pokemon game will also be putting a spin on the established norms of the franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/">by introducing real-time battles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-is-getting-four-player-battles/1100-6534031/">free-for-all showdowns</a> for up to four players, and with a lengthy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-confirmed-for-september-12/1100-6534609/" data-ref-id="1100-6534609">Nintendo Direct scheduled for September 12</a>, we could see more footage of the game in action.</p>

                <p>United States Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced that the National Institutes of Health are looking into a range of issues as it relates to what may contribute to gun violence in the United States. He also cited video games as a possible cause of real-world violence.</p><p>"The firearms question is a complex question, and it's not an easy question," he said in response to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">question from PBS</a> about if the government is looking into mental health when it comes to gun violence.</p><p>He called out a variety of factors that could contribute to an uptick in real-world violence, including "dependence on psychiatric drugs," along with video games and social media. "We are initiating studies now that look at the correlation and the potential connection between over-medicating our kids and this violence." He did not elaborate on video games, however.</p><p>This comes not long after RFK Jr. appeared in a tense Washington hearing in which senators questioned him about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/in-tense-hearing-rfk-jr-challenged-on-vaccine-views-and-trust-in-health-agencies" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">his views on vaccines and numerous other claims</a> he has made over the years. Many have called for his resignation, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/rfk-jrs-family-members-call-for-his-resignation-say-he-is-a-threat-to-americans-health" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">including his own family members</a>, while <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/5483021-hhs-employees-call-for-rfk-resignation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some CDC staff walked out in protest.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH-AXTo3Am8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qH-AXTo3Am8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>What some studies have already found</strong></h2><p>For years, people have maintained there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/professor-it-s-clear-playing-violent-games-increases-aggressive-behavior/1100-6417754/" data-ref-id="1100-6417754">absolutely a connection between violent video games and increases in aggressive behavior</a>. A <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790614/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2019 study from Tobias Greitemeyer</a>, a Department of Psychology professor a the University of Innsbruck in Austria, suggested that time spent playing violent video games "increases aggression in the player." The research also suggested that "violent video game play also affects individuals with whom the player is connected."</p><p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34801150/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another study</a> found that, "Exposure to violent media, especially violent video games, may cause desensitization to real-life violence." <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10354552/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One further study</a> found that video game violence "should be considered a risk factor for aggression, as in other violent media, as it provides a social reinforcement of aggressive behavior and observational learning of aggressive models."</p><p>A study from Oxford discovered <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-02-13-violent-video-games-found-not-be-associated-adolescent-aggression" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no link</a> between aggressive behavior in teenagers and the amount of time they spent playing violent video games. "Our findings suggest that researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games," co-author Dr Netta Weinstein from Cardiff University said.</p><p>This study came after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/violent-video-games-dont-lead-to-increases-in-viol/1100-6422421/" data-ref-id="1100-6422421">years of published, vetted research</a> that showed there is no connection between violent video games and increase in violent crimes.</p><h2><strong>What has Trump said about video games?</strong></h2><p>RFK Jr.'s boss, US president Donald Trump, has previously spoken out about violence in video games.</p><p>"We must stop the glorification of violence in our society," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trump-blames-video-games-for-mass-shootings-indust/1100-6468929/" data-ref-id="1100-6468929">the president said in 2019 following mass shootings in America</a>. "This includes the gruesome and grisly video games that are now commonplace. It is too easy today for troubled youth to surround themselves with a culture that celebrates violence. We must stop or substantially reduce this, and it has to begin immediately."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA), which lobbies on behalf of the video game industry and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/if-this-new-video-game-loot-box-bill-becomes-law-i/1100-6456767/" data-ref-id="1100-6456767">seeks to avoid government regulation</a>, said "numerous scientific studies have established that there is no causal connection between video games and violence."</p><h2><strong>This has been a talking point for some time</strong></h2><p>The debate about violent video games and what effect there may or may not be on real-world violence has been going on for decades. Some may recall how then US Senator <a href="https://youtu.be/d3GTJOZLaPY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hillary Clinton said in 2005</a> violent video games are a major problem and studies have shown they are bad for children. She also said violent video games should be regulated like alcohol and tobacco.</p><p>"Violent video games increase aggressive behavior as much as lead exposure decreases children's IQ scores," Clinton said. "We need to treat violent video games the way we treat tobacco, alcohol, and pornography. We know these products are damaging to children and we ned to give parents the tools to keep them out of kids' hands."</p><h2>RFK Jr. is, or was, invested in video games</h2><p>In 2024, RFK Jr. revealed that he <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/21/rfk-jr-says-he-invested-24000-in-gamestop-amid-re-.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">invested $24,000 into GameStop</a> as a means to show support for retail investors over institutional investors following the 2021 GameStop short-squeeze situation. RFK Jr. said he invested in GameStop after Keith Gill AKA Roaring Kitty resurfaced in May 2024--when GameStop's shares were trading around $17--and reignited the GameStop stock phenomenon. After Roaring Kitty began posting again, GameStop's stock price surged, and the stock price remains above $23. We don't know if RFK Jr. still holds a position in GameStop.</p>
