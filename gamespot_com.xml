                <p>Ubisoft has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and according to the patch notes, this one is designed to address several more issues in the game. Title update 1.0.3 will go live today, and while it's not nearly as massive as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">previous patch</a>, you can expect bug fixes and PS5 Pro improvements. Curiously, the patch will also temporarily deactivate the auto-sell feature in the game, as Ubisoft says that it has to work out some unexpected issues introduced by that function.</p><p>For PS5 Pro players, a graphical issue caused by activating the HDR and PSSR options will be fixed, and PS5 owners in general can expect several other crash-related bugs to be solved. For download sizes, the patch is quite small on PS5 and PC via Steam, while Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Mac users can expect a longer download session. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>In related news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-now-2025s-second-biggest-game-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6530868/">Assassin's Creed Shadows is currently the second-best-selling game in the US</a> for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds, which is still the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">best-selling game of 2025</a> so far. Ubisoft is also considering adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/">an even higher level of difficulty</a> to the game in a future update.</p><h2>AC Shadows Title Update 1.0.3 Release Notes</h2><h3>Patch Sizes</h3><ul><li>Xbox Series X|S: 11 GB</li><li>PlayStation 5: 0.492 GB</li><li>PC: 9.03 GB</li><li>Steam: 0.40 GB</li><li>Mac: 9 GB</li></ul><h2>List of bug fixes</h2><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Deactivated the multi-sell features in shops due to unexpected issues</li><li>Fixed an issue where the option to call the allies was missing</li></ul><h3>Stability and Performance</h3><ul><li>Fixed stuttering issues on PC</li><li>Fixed a crash happening during the prologue</li><li>Fixed a graphical distortion on Yasuke's outfit after dodging</li><li>Fixed crashing and visual issues with the 'Claw of Dragon' skin when applied to weapons</li><li><strong>NOTE</strong>: Visual customization for this weapon will be re-enabled with this update</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue with audio loss</li></ul><h3>PS5 and PS5 Pro</h3><ul><li>Fixed a graphical issue when activating the HDR and PSSR for PS5 Pro</li><li>Fixed crash issues on PS5</li></ul>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has further discussed Xbox Game Pass, saying the subscription service is "not for everybody," and that if every Game Pass subscriber canceled their membership and decided to buy games outright instead, that would be good for Microsoft as well.</p><p>So who is Game Pass for? Spencer told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> it can be a "healthy option for certain people," but he acknowledged that Microsoft isn't trying to get everyone to sign up.</p><p>"It's not for everybody. If you play one or two games a year, Game Pass probably isn't the right business model for you; you should just buy those two games, and that would make total sense," he said. "But I want you to have the choice. So we remain focused on everything that's on Game Pass is also available to buy."</p><p>Many have wondered about the economic realities of Game Pass, and while Spencer didn't get into that, he said the number of total hours people are playing on Xbox "continues to grow fairly substantially," in part due to Game Pass. "Game Pass has been an important part of that, but I don't try to solve for Game Pass specifically on its own. It's kind of part of the equation for Xbox finding new players," he said.</p><p>As Spencer has said time and again over the years, Game Pass is only one option in the overall Xbox ecosystem for how people can play games on Xbox. He's not trying to get everyone to sign up, but instead wants to position Game Pass as one possible way to consume Xbox games.</p><p>"I've always thought about Game Pass as just another option for somebody who wants to play. We have many business models for people playing from free-to-play, buying games, discounted games--Game Pass is an option," he explained. "So when I'm looking at Game Pass, I want to make sure the hours that people are playing continue to go up, that new people see this as a way for them to find and build their library of games, and we remain focused on that," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer said the video game console business is "good," but it's an "established" market sector that is "not really a growing segment in gaming," at least not for Microsoft. As such, Spencer said that's why you're seeing Microsoft invest in and support PC and cloud as much as it is.</p><p>"There isn't a unique need for Game Pass to be the only way for people to play. If everybody who's a Game Pass subscriber instead decided to buy their games, that's good for the business as well."</p><p>While console sales may not be growing for Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-x-s-falls-behind-xbox-one-in-us/1100-6524789/" data-ref-id="1100-6524789">they are for its rival PlayStation</a>. The industry also saw enormous console growth with Nintendo's Switch console, which has sold more than 150 million units to rank as Nintendo's best-selling home platform ever.</p><p>In related news, the Game Pass library was restocked this week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">GTA 5 for Xbox Series X|S and GTA 5 Enhanced for PC</a>.

And looking ahead, Spencer said, "I want to support Switch 2."</p><p>"Nintendo has been a great partner. We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players, who aren't players on Xbox. It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about the franchises that we have, and that's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games," he said.</p><p>Spencer added: "I'm really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them.

coming to the console.</a> Spencer has previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-xbox-games-are-coming-to-switch-2/1100-6529052/" data-ref-id="1100-6529052">strongly indicated that Xbox games are coming to Switch 2.</a> One likely candidate, just to start with, would be Minecraft, given that game's size and scale.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer was asked if Nintendo unveiling the Switch 2 makes Microsoft "antsy to announce" plans for the next Xbox. Spencer replied, "No."</p><p>"I think all of us in this industry should focus on our communities and the player base that we're building. I get inspired by what a lot of different creators do and other platform holders. But I believe in the plans that we have," he said. "Obviously, we're evolving what it means to be Xbox and meeting players in so many different places. There are 3 billion people who play video games on the planet and I get up every morning and think about how Xbox can be more relevant to the 3 billion people who play."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. As for Microsoft's plans for the future, the company is reportedly planning to launch a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">new Xbox console and a handheld device.</a> There is no word yet, however, on when a new Xbox might be released.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skull and Bones: Year 2 Update Announcements Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The teaser shown off as part of the Skull and Bones Year 2 Showcase shows early gameplay with pirates dual-wielding blades and firearms. It looks like players will have the option of getting up close and personal or picking enemies off from a distance, depending on their choice of weapon.</p><p>The new combat style is set to be integrated in Year 2's third season as part of a larger content update adding officers to player ships. In order to recruit said officers, players will have to undertake the land-based missions to rescue officers being held in captivity by the Rogue Warlord.</p><p>From what was shown off in the showcase, the land combat appears to be purely PvE, and takes place entirely on land--meaning boarding enemy ships and on-deck combat is unlikely to arrive with this combat update, despite also being highly requested by players.</p><p>Skull and Bones Year 2 Season 1 has already kicked off, bringing with it item ascension, world tiers, new developments in the world's story, and more new features. Players will have to wait until later in the year for the debut of land combat in Season 3.</p>

                <p> The next Battlefield game doesn't even have an official name yet, but fans are already hands-on with an early build thanks to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs playtest program</a>. That program has proved a headache for devs, with participants leaking footage in spite of NDAs, and starting rumors about the use of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM).</p><p>A rumor that Battlefield 6 would use SBMM, which likely originated from the playtest, has spread through the Battlefield community, with fans up in arms about its potential inclusion. Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland attempted to clarify the use of SBMM with playtesters, in a post that was later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared to Reddit</a>. </p><p>"Just for clarity--saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is 'Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad,'" Sirland said in the post. "But that doesn't make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams--no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn't be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?"</p><p>Sirland added that Battlefield 2042 also would be considered to have SBMM by this definition, and attempted to calm down the conversation by assuring fans that any SBMM used in Battlefield 6 would be applied with a light touch. The response to Sirland's comments being shared to Reddit only reignited the discussion, prompting Battlefield's global community manager T0TALfps to step in. </p><p>"Okay enough," T0TALfps's comment started, trying to put an end to the ongoing discourse. The community manager reminded players that the build that part of the BF Labs playtest is far from a finished game, and there is no guarantee that any feature in it will make it to the finish line in the same form. T0TALfps continued to tell off leakers who ignored NDAs to spread details about the early playtests.</p><p>"There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it," they said. "We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to."</p><p>It will likely be a while until we get more official details on the next Battlefield game--including its official title. According to a recent EA financial report, the company expects the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">release before March 2026</a>. Interested players can still sign up for the <a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs playtest</a> program in the meantime.</p>
