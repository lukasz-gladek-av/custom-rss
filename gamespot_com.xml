                <p>Vampire Survivors has spawned a wave of games inspired by it in the years since it was first released, and Warhammer Survivors is the next game set in this genre of endless hordes and power-ups. Featuring characters and weapons from both Warhammer 40K and Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, Warhammer Survivors is a co-production between Auroch Digital and Vampire Survivors developer Poncle, using the same engine that powers the roguelite survivors game it's inspired by. It's scheduled to launch in 2026 for PC via Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5E_EaxN1qo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P5E_EaxN1qo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Like Vampire Survivors, the focus will be on taking down waves of enemies, powering up your character, and evolving your weapons. You can choose to play in the sci-fi world of Warhammer 40K or the fantasy realm of Warhammer: Age of Sigmar, and the roster includes characters like Malum Caedo, Neave Blacktalon, and more.</p><p>As for the weapons, Auroch Digital says you can expect favorites like the Astartes chainsword, whirlwind axes, and Bolter gun, and once combined with certain power-ups, players will be able to clear the screen of any heretics.</p><p>This is just one of several Warhammer 40K games in development, as fans of the franchise can also look forward <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-4-announced-coming-next-year-to-pc/1100-6534085/" data-ref-id="1100-6534085">Warhammer 40K: Dawn of War 4</a> on PC next year.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced-very-unexpected-spin-off-out-now/1100-6531732/" data-ref-id="1100-6531732"> Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a> was officially revealed in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-is-officially-now-in-development/1100-6530114/" data-ref-id="1100-6530114">Space Marine 3 is in development</a>, and Rogue Trader studio Owlcat Games is working on a new CRPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">called Dark Heresy</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has debuted a new advertisement for Xbox Game Pass aimed at reminding people that they don't have to wait very long to play more games. The "New Games Added All The Time" ad focuses on a sad-looking, tired person sitting inside a disc-return box waiting for someone to return a game so they can play it. This is meant to highlight how people used to rent games at places like Blockbuster but had to wait, in some cases at least, for people to return their copies.</p><p>"That was then," the ad states before cutting to the person sitting at their desk at home and booting up a game from the Game Pass library. "Now, new games are added all the time," the ad says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5IJn83bV_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q5IJn83bV_8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft normally adds games to Game Pass across two waves each month, and there are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 850 titles</a> available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>While it's true Microsoft adds more and more games to the Game Pass library on an ongoing basis, the company also removes games twice a month as well. For October, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#consoleleavingsoon" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the titles set for removal is Stalker 2</a>, and some people are complaining about this given it was heavily promoted by Microsoft as an Xbox console exclusive.</p><p>It's being removed this month presumably due to the expiration of an agreement, as the game lands on PS5 on November 20, which is exactly one year after the game came to Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Microsoft recently announced a huge price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, raising the monthly cost from $20 to $30. Most major retailers have not adopted the price hike, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">Game Pass Ultimate remains $20 at GameStop, Amazon, Best Buy, and others.</a></p>
