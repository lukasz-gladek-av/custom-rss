                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games has revealed a new map for the game, set inside an abandoned restaurant. The location--Neil's Diner--was unveiled during a TwitchCon panel that celebrated the recent fifth anniversary of the co-op horror game, and players can explore it starting November 11.</p><p>Kinetic Games described Neil's Diner as a "run-down, retro restaurant" that's been long-abandoned by staff and diners alike. While this is one of the smaller maps in Phasmophobia, it's still full of authentic details and phantoms hungry for thrills.</p><p>"We always thought a diner would fit perfectly, so Nell's was born, and it's been such a fun challenge bringing it to life," lead developer Daniel Knight said in a press release. "Alongside the farmhouse reworks from this year, Nell's is an example of how we want all the maps in Phasmophobia to feel going forward. It's unique, and has been meticulously designed to tell more of a story to our players--beyond the immediate ghost theyâ€™re hunting."</p><p>Phasmophobia will be releasing into version 1.0 next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-is-preparing-to-shake-things-up-again/1100-6535210/">but this is just the start of Kinetic's big plans for its hit game</a>. An upcoming overhaul--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-dev-promises-overhaul-that-will-make-it-feel-like-a-new-game/1100-6533159/">dubbed Horror 2.0</a>--will release alongside the 1.0 launch, and the studio says that the update will make Phasmaphobia feel like a new game. Hollywood is also calling, as production company Blumhouse--Five Nights at Freddy's, Paranormal Activity, The Purge, and Insidious--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/">is adapting the game for the big screen</a>.</p>
