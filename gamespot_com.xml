                <p>If it's in pop culture, then it's going inevitably come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-remix-chapter-2/2900-5929/" data-ref-id="2900-5929">Fortnite</a> in some form or another. Now, it's apparently Skibidi Toilet's turn to make an entrance into the popular battle royale shooter game.</p><p>Fortnite leaker SpushFNBR was the first to report that a Fortnite X Skibidi Toilet collaboration will drop tomorrow, December 18, with a Plungerman skin--with a Lego variant-- for 1,500 V-Bucks, as well as a Skibidi Toilet backpack for 600 V-Bucks, and a Pickaxe Pungerman's Plunger for 800 V-Bucks. The bundle for all three will reportedly cost 2,800 V-Bucks.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FORTNITE X SKIBIDI TOILET (its real)<br>Skin "Plugerman": 1500 vbucks, includes a LEGO style<br>Skibidi Backpack: comes with the outfit<br>Skibidi Toilet backpack: 600 vbucks<br>Pickaxe Plungerman's Plunger: 800 vbucks<br>Will be sold in a bundle for 2800 vbucks.<br>Avaible tomorrow in the shop <a href="https://t.co/sHOTXfLSlF" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/sHOTXfLSlF</a></p>  â€” SpushFNBR (@SpushFNBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpushFNBR/status/1869022252060365263?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Skibidi Toilet is the creation of Alexey Gerasimov, whose YouTube channel debuted a series of machinma shorts depicting a war between toilets with human heads and the Alliance--people who have electronic devices in place of their heads. Earlier this year, Gerasimov reportedly <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/skibidi-toilet-michael-bay-movie-adam-goodman-1236077245/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">entered talks with director Michael Bay</a> regarding Skibidi Toilet film and TV series adaptations.</p><p>Plungerman is an original character created for the series who is part of the Alliance under the Cameramen faction. He uses twin plungers as his weapons in the war against the Skibidi Toilets. Though it's an original "universe," the series makes use of Half-Life assets to disturbing effect.</p><p>Epic Games recently launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-expands-with-new-social-sim-brick-life/1100-6528297/" data-ref-id="1100-6528297">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</a>, an open-world social-sim expansion for Lego Fortnite. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-returns-permanently-in-december-report/1100-6527620/" data-ref-id="1100-6527620">OG Fortnite</a> returned earlier this month, and it's back permanently. In other Fortnite-related news, Epic Games is sending out its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-settlement-payouts-are-now-going-out-so-you-might-have-money-waiting-for-you/1100-6528329/" data-ref-id="1100-6528329">FTC-mandated settlement checks</a>. The Federal Trade Commission hit Epic Games over Fortnite's "counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." Players who were playing Fortnite before 2022 can still file <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">settlement claims on the FTC website</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Nightlord will apparently pluck foes from the past to stop players in Elden Ring: Nightreign. Game director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed that Dark Souls enemies will show up in the upcoming co-op action-RPG.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Ishizaki noted that a handful of Dark Souls adversaries will appear in Elden Ring: Nightreign during <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/27477" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Famitsu interview</a>. This comes after fans believed they saw The Nameless King from Dark Souls 3 featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-for-2025-co-op-action-spin-off/1100-6528435/" data-ref-id="1100-6528435">the co-op survival game's debut trailer at The Game Awards</a> last week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djtsw5k_DNc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="6">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc?start=6" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Ishizaki recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-isnt-a-live-service-game-and-wont-be-full-priced/1100-6528462/" data-ref-id="1100-6528462">Elden Ring: Nightreign isn't a live-service game</a>, even though it features multiplayer-centric survival features.

There is the ability to play between console generations--PS4 owners with PS5 players, for example--but not across different platforms. From Software will have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-offers-an-early-opportunity-to-return-to-the-lands-between/1100-6528472/" data-ref-id="1100-6528472">a network test for the action-RPG in February 2025</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Leaning into roguelike mechanics, Elden Ring: Nightreign will see players starting a three-day-and-night cycle to ultimately take down the Nightlord. From Software wants each run to be unique, though relics can be carried over with future attempts in Limveld. The co-op game, which can be played solo, is set to release next year.</p>

                <p>Talk to most collectors and they'll tell you that the pandemic almost five years ago changed the way people buy and sell collectibles. Pokemon cards were heavily affected and some big chain retailers like Target had to limit the number of packs they could sell to customers. They've become such a hot commodity that Japan's news media has reported that the mob is using cards to assist in laundering money.</p><p>As Shunkan Gendai online reports (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/nongaming-news/pokemon-cards-are-so-valuable-that-criminals-are-using-them-to-launder-dirty-money-japanese-media-reports/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), criminals have been turning their dirty money into Pokemon cards. The cards' portable size makes them easy to hide and transport, and then they resell the cards, converting their profits into local currency.</p><p>"Many criminals who commit bank transfer fraud are converting the money they steal into Pokemon cards. Shady money can't be deposited in a bank, and there's a high risk of it being stolen if you hold it in cash," a former high ranked crime family member explained. "Pokemon cards are easy to hide, and if you take them overseas and cash them there, you can't get tracked down."</p><p>Criminals have also gotten smarter with what to look out for and feel for when trying to get the more valuable cards. With the chances of getting sought-after Pokemon-ex cards rare already, criminals are now using metal detectors to get a hit on the foil from the card. They're also implementing highly sensitive weighing devices to determine if an unopened pack contains a rare foil card.</p><p>In 2022, YouTuber and WWE performer Logan Paul bought a graded Pikachu Illustrator card for $5.7 million, making it the most expensive card ever sold. The Pikachu Illustrator was only awarded to the winners of the Original Illustration Contest in Japan, with only 20-39 known copies ever released. Similarly graded cards are priced on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/362931142416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">eBay for $2-$4 million</a>.</p>
