                <p>If you've been working through Lance's quests in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you've probably come across Prescriptions of the Past, wherein this quirky trader sends you off to round up anything useful in the Medical Exam Room of the Departure Building. And with that, you'll be off to Spaceport.</p><p>Extracting isn't a requirement for completing Prescriptions of the Past, but it is a high-traffic area. If you're a pretty peaceful player, you may want to bring in a free loadout so you don't sacrifice good loot if someone picks a fight you're not interested in entertaining. Alternatively, if you're feeling froggy, bring some good guns and plenty of ammo to introduce to any PVPers in the vicinity.</p><p>Either way, when you're ready to wrap up Prescriptions of the Past, follow the guide below.</p><h2 id="Visit_the_Departure_Building_in_Spaceport">Visit the Departure Building in Spaceport</h2><p>The Departure Building is located on the west side of Spaceport. This POI is known to contain a lot of searchable drawers and containers, making it a popular destination for raiders seeking a high chance at good loot. With that in mind, keep your eyes peeled for any shady characters looming about with their guns out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633285-share_20260110_0327250.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633285" data-ratio="0.56415094339623" data-width="2120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633285-share_20260110_0327250.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633285"></a><figcaption>Departure Building</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633285-share_20260110_0327250.jpeg"></figure><p>For the most straightforward approach, head into the Departure Building from the north through the main entrance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633288-share_20260110_0326010.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633288" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633288-share_20260110_0326010.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633288"></a><figcaption>Enter the building from the north.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633288-share_20260110_0326010.jpeg"></figure><p>When you enter the building, you should receive an updated objective asking you to find the Medical Exam Room.</p><h2 id="Find_the_Medical_Exam_Room_inside_the_Departure_Building">Find the Medical Exam Room inside the Departure Building</h2><p>Once you're inside the Departure Building, head up the stairs to the right. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633289-share_20260110_0325292.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633289" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633289-share_20260110_0325292.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633289"></a><figcaption>Take the stairs up and around to the next floor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633289-share_20260110_0325292.jpeg"></figure><p>Follow this staircase to the right to reach the next floor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633290-share_20260110_0325420.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633290" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633290-share_20260110_0325420.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4633290"></a><figcaption>Take a left at the top of the stairs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4633290-share_20260110_0325420.jpeg"></figure><p>At the top of the stairs, break left immediately, then enter the nearby door on the left.

                <p>The Sims is no stranger to collaborating with major fashion brands. Back in 2007, developer Maxis partnered up with H&amp;M to bring dozens of real-life clothing items to The Sims 2. In more recent years, both Primark and Moschino have made their way into the series with The Sims 4 Stuff Packs. Now, the American brand Coach is headed to the game in the series' most luxurious collab yet.</p><p>Starting on January 13, The Sims 4 players will gain access to The Coach Collection, a catalog of nine new items inspired by the "wearable staples" and "bold statement pieces" Coach is known for. The Create-A-Sim items coming include the company's Soho sneakers, a varsity jacket, and sleek skirt sets, while Build Mode will receive the heritage trunk and both Tabby and Brooklyn purses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png" data-ref-id="1300-4633180"></a><figcaption>A look at the upcoming Coach collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4633180-image.png"></figure><p>In addition to these items, The Coach Collection comes with a new family available to move in via The Sims Gallery: The Carriage House. The press release described the family as "three friends chasing big dreams, big style, and a little bit of drama." The gallery will also feature a new room to place named the "In The Bag room," which appears to be a large walk-in closet that will allow Sims to show off their luxury handbags in style.</p><p>In other The Sims news, developer Maxis recently released a statement assuring players that its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sims-team-says-values-are-unchanged-ahead-of-potential-saudi-ea-deal/1100-6537303/" data-ref-id="1100-6537303">values are unchanged</a>" following news that parent company EA is looking to sell itself to the Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The team also reiterated that it is committed to creating "single-player life simulation experiences" while also teasing upcoming The Sims experiences for PC, consoles, and mobile.</p>
