                <p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> players called out the apparent use of AI in the game, especially the "Ghibli-style" Calling Cards. Activision subsequently acknowledged that some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">AI was used in the creation of Black Ops 7</a>, but it insisted that the creative process is still in the hands of humans. Regardless, a US Congressman has weighed in on the Black Ops 7 debate and called for extensive AI regulations.</p><p>California Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna--who has previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">accused Roblox of not doing enough</a> to protect children who use it--reposted a message about the Ghibli-like Calling Cards and wrote, "We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits. Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1989470230356308349" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We need regulations that prevent companies from using AI to eliminate jobs to extract greater profits.<br>Artists at these companies need to have a say in how AI is deployed.<br>They should share in the profits. And there should be a tax on mass displacement. <a href="https://t.co/uU2tmt8pDJ" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/uU2tmt8pDJ</a></p>  — Ro Khanna (@RoKhanna) <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1989470230356308349?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In a subsequent <a href="https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/1989489253256950175" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Khanna shared some proposals from Nobel Laureate Acemoglu, including "tax reforms to discourage excessive automation" and allowing workers and unions to benefit from AI gains rather than being replaced by artificial intelligence. Khanna also stressed that he isn't calling for a complete ban on AI.</p><p>"Innovation and technological advance is patriotic and good for humanity provided it serves people," <a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna/status/1989773191942639788" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> Khanna. "So we need to think about how it is adopted and how people can still have meaningful work and independence."</p><p>That doesn't appear to be the primary sentiment behind AI implementation in the video game industry. PUBG publisher Krafton recently encouraged "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-krafton-offers-voluntary-resignations-following-ai-first-investment/1100-6536185/" data-ref-id="1100-6536185">voluntary resignations</a>" from employees after declaring itself to be an "AI-first company." Unknown Worlds Entertainment--a studio owned by Krafton--subsequently claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">it won't use AI</a> in its upcoming sequel, Subnautica 2.</p><p>Square Enix has announced its plans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-wants-genai-to-automate-70-of-game-qa-by-2027/1100-6535996/" data-ref-id="1100-6535996">use AI to replace 70% of its QA testers</a> by 2027, while EA has reportedly told its employees to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/">consider AI as a "thought partner."</a> Outside of the gaming realm, Pope Leo XIV has proclaimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pope-francis-says-ai-innovation-must-honour-the-sanctity-of-human-life/1100-6536079/" data-ref-id="1100-6536079">AI must honor the sanctity of human life</a>.</p>
