                <p>Capcom released an absolute gem of a game this year. No, I'm not talking about Dragon's Dogma 2, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, or Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection--all of which hit shelves in 2024. And you didn't miss a stealth release in the Resident Evil, Street Fighter, or Monster Hunter series. Alongside three major well-received releases, Capcom released an off-beat game filled with ghosts, Japanese tradition, and strategic job assignment: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess. This game was released in 2024, but it feels like it was sent forward from 2004--in all the best ways.</p><p>No one is going to blame you for having missed it. To say it flew under the radar is an understatement, and Capcom said in a recent financial briefing that the game did not meet sales targets. But Kunitsu-Gami should be treated as almost a historical document, both in the way the game is designed and in its actual content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414274-kunitsu-gami-02.jpg"></figure><p>As the warrior Soh, you have to protect the divine maiden Yoshiro so that she can purify the defiled mountain, freeing villagers to help you in a sort of worker-management real-time-strategy game that takes you in a zig-zag path down the mountain and through all manner of monsters and ghosts plucked from Japanese folklore.</p><p>The rhythm of the game is simple: By day, you'll rescue villagers, restore tower defense-style obstacles, and try to get Yoshiro as close to the gate as possible without bringing her so close that she becomes endangered. You'll also assign the villagers roles like Woodsman, Archer, Ascetic, Sumo, or one of many other classes. At night, you'll defend Yoshiro with the help of those villagers, managing the villagers to make them effective and keep them safe. Once you've stopped the monsters, everybody does a dance to purify the gate.</p><h3>Classic Design</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414275"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414275-kunitsu-gami-04.jpg"></figure><p>Many games these days are designed to appeal to as many people as possible and provide dozens or even hundreds of hours of gameplay, often advertising piles of DLC and in-game currency that costs real-world money. Kunitsu-Gami feels silent by comparison. There's one piece of DLC, and it's free even for the Game Pass players--some simple Okami-themed cosmetics, such as a charm that causes grass to grow behind you when you walk, that both looks like something straight out of the 2006 Capcom classic and that feels of a piece with the look of Kunitsu-Gami. There's nothing extra to buy, unless you count the soundtrack, which is available on Steam.</p><p>The game itself is linear, giving you an increasingly difficult playlist of stages and a growing stable of character classes to assign. You can go back and replay levels for additional rewards, but they're optional. The game is challenging, but it never asks you to fiddle around with collecting knick-knacks, clearing towers, or whatever else. It's just a strategy game, and that alone makes it somewhat harder to approach. It isn't a variation on a well-trodden set of gameplay mechanics and themes. Kunitsu-Gami asks the player to learn a new set of systems as they manage their villagers and resources, and to do that in a world of folklore that will be entirely new to many Western players.</p><p>The whole game feels like it was somehow delayed by 20 years and only just came out now, but that's not a dig on it--the opposite, in fact. Publishers similar in size to Capcom just don't make games like this anymore.</p><h3>Traditional Art</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414276-kunitsu-gami-03.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond feeling like a welcome trip to the gaming of days past, Kunitsu-Gami aesthetic looks backward as well, but into Japanese folklore and tradition. Many games reflect the place in which it was made, but Kunitsu-Gami takes this to another level. Kunitsu-Gami is steeped in Japanese art.</p><p>The movements of Soh, Yoshiro, and the villagers are pulled from Kagura ritual dance, including Soh's sword combat moves. You can find woodblock prints telling you about the different monsters you fight. The designs of the monsters themselves mimic traditional art of yokai (ghosts) and bakemono (monsters) in Japanese woodblock art. Where games like Nioh and Ghost of Tsushima are interested in immersing you in their worlds and making you feel like you're the guy having the adventure (a totally valid approach!), Kunitsu-Gami presents a world that feels like a diorama of a fairytale. Photorealism is the last thing on its mind.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-atP9Csjhw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/B-atP9Csjhw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The music, too, finds inspiration in traditional children's songs and rhymes, and uses a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and modern Western instruments to create a fusion of sounds that feels historical without being limiting. You can present Yoshiro with traditional Japanese confections made by real confectioners. The team behind the game took those confections and scanned them into the game in extreme detail to capture the look and feel of the food. Much of the architecture and clothing also comes from physically crafted objects, all created with an eye toward authenticity to the art itself. The game may be a digital creation, but the things that inspired it are historical and physical, and so the art in the game is, too.</p><p>Just making sense of Kunitsu-Gami from an artistic perspective is a tall order, and you could spend dozens of hours studying each element and still come back with questions. It's steeped in historical Japanese culture, with such attention to detail that it might as well qualify as a piece of Japanese historical preservation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4414278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4414278-kunitsu-gami-01.jpg"></figure><p>Even the marketing for Kunitsu-Gami reaches back into Japanese history, as Capcom partnered with a Bunraku troupe for part of the game's advertising. Bunraku (puppet) theater is one of the oldest forms of performing art in Japan.</p><p>When I think about Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess as a physical game, I don't imagine a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X label on the box. In their place is a PlayStation 2 or 3 label, or maybe even a GameCube one, and I'm in my first apartment, playing it at midnight when I have class the next morning. Despite being a new game, Kunitsu-Gami is an artifact from another time in the best way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> did huge numbers when it was released in June 2023, with positive reviews, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-passes-666-million-in-sales-sets-new-blizzard-record/1100-6515145/">impressive sales numbers</a>, and over 12 million players. But for those who finished the game's campaign and dove into its endgame content, the real meat of an ARPG like Diablo, it was clear something was amiss.</p><p dir="ltr">Item progression was frustrating and often felt like a chore. There were few endgame activities and little reason to do them. Seasonal updates added new mechanics and smaller fixes but didn't solve the underlying structural issues players had with the latest entry in Blizzard's legendary loot-chasing franchise. It carried echoes of Diablo 3's 2012 launch, when players quickly became frustrated by its endgame loop (and its real-money auction house). Was Blizzard repeating the same mistake twice?</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a year makes. Whereas it took around two years for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/">Diablo 3 to become great</a> with the addition of its Reaper of Souls expansion, Diablo 4 today is vastly improved to the one of last year or even just seven months ago. Whereas I quickly fell off Diablo 4's endgame loot grind at launch, I'm now hooked thanks to free updates that overhauled itemization and revamped its difficulty. Diablo 4's endgame loop is now extremely satisfying, and I'm continuing to chase those smaller upgrades and highly coveted Mythic Unique items that could take my character ever slightly further--something that felt like a fool's errand a year ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the biggest changes came alongside Diablo 4's appropriately named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Loot Reborn update</a> in May. Items gained fewer affixes but ones that were more useful, making it easier to parse at a glance whether an item may be useful or not. Legendary Aspects, once a chore to find and replace, became an almost automated process, with salvaged Legendary items automatically having their Aspects added to the in-game codex for easy imprinting on future items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659"></a><figcaption>Masterworking gives players a reason to grind out endgame activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The addition of two new itemization systems, Masterworking and Tempering, is what truly took Diablo 4's items and its endgame into overdrive. Tempering allowed players to add certain affixes to items in order to hand-craft the perfect weapon or piece of armor. Masterworking, meanwhile, pushed players to upgrade a Tempered item into the ultimate version of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Loot Reborn proved to be a game-changer, not only because of the agency it gave players when it came to gearing up, but also for giving reasons to continue deep into Diablo 4's endgame. The addition of The Pit, a new timed endgame dungeon where materials needed to Masterwork items could be found, additionally gave players more goals to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as these systems overhauled Diablo 4's items and endgame, the game's 2.0 update, released alongside its first expansion in October, pushed things even further. Blizzard dropped the game's confusing World Tier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/">difficulty system and instead replaced it with one more akin to Diablo 3</a>. It reorganized the endgame to form a more satisfying endgame progression loop, with Masterworking materials shifting to be found in Nightmare dungeons, and Glyph XP moving to The Pit. A new roguelite endgame activity introduced in Diablo 4 Season 5, Infernal Hordes, became a permanent fixture in update 2.0, giving players more options when it came to choosing how to spend their endgame time.</p><p dir="ltr">All of those changes are without even mentioning the additions that came as part of the paid Vessel of Hatred expansion. It added a new region to explore, continued the game's story, introduced an additional endgame activity in the Kurast Undercity, brought recruitable Mercenaries into the fray, tossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/">Runewords into the build-customizing equation</a>, and added a brand-new (and very overpowered) class: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/">Spiritborn</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660" data-ratio="0.56256983240223" data-width="1790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660"></a><figcaption>Infernal Hordes adds some roguelite flair to Diablo 4's endgame loop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, when it comes to the endgame, players have choices. Do I need to Masterwork my gear more? I can run Nightmare dungeons or Infernal Hordes. Maybe I need to upgrade my Glyphs, so I'll hit up The Pit for a bit. If I'm looking for runes, a particular type of item, or materials, I can do an Undercity Tribute run with that specific goal in mind. Or if I'm looking for a certain Unique or Mythic Unique item, I can target-farm one of the endgame bosses for a higher chance of finding what I'm looking for. Diablo 4's endgame now lets me easily work towards whatever goals I have for my character and gives me options when doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these endgame activities feed into each other. Running The Pit will give me tributes to use for the Undercity. Doing Undercity can give me boss-summoning materials. Defeating those bosses will give me Infernal Horde keys, which I can then use to gain Masterworking materials. It all feeds into itself in a satisfying endgame loop that keeps me playing, slaying, and upgrading, something that was definitely not the case when Diablo 4 launched.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say there's no room for improvement. Though there is now much more to do in Diablo 4's endgame, there are few real challenges or reasons to keep pushing after a certain point. Most dedicated players will be able to easily clear higher-levels of The Pit or defeat the game's Torment bosses on the game's highest difficulty, after which gear upgrades simply allow players to clear those activities slightly faster. Doing things faster can be fun (and makes for efficient farming) but can lose its luster after a while without additional goals to pursue. Bugs also continue to be an ongoing issue, and Blizzard could benefit from putting a bit more polish on updates before releasing them out into the wild (something the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/">public test realm, also introduced this year</a>, does help with).</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's road of refinement likely won't be coming to an end anytime soon, but I am impressed at how far it has come in a relatively short amount of time. Even though Vessel of Hatred proved to be an excellent addition, it was this year's free Loot Reborn and 2.0 updates, more than the paid expansion, that transformed Diablo 4 from just "okay" into a great ARPG worthy of the Diablo name. It's fitting that Diablo 4 found its footing just ahead of Grinding Gear Games releasing the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/">Path of Exile 2 into early access</a>. Suddenly, the battle to be the top ARPG in the genre Blizzard invented is heating up. If Diablo 4's 2025 is anything like its 2024, next year will be a banner year for the genre, and I can't wait to see what's in store.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>
