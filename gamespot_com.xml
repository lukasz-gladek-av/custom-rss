Survivors of many battles, they pose the biggest threat once you've reached the endgame portion of the campaign. They also offer you with the best rewards possible, so you should definitely track them down. Our guide discusses how to eliminate these targets so you can craft high-end gear known as Artian Weapons.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#What_are_Artian_Weapons_and_Tempered_Monsters_in_Monster_Hunter_Wilds">What are Artian Weapons and Tempered Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_track_down_Tempered_Monsters">How to track down Tempered Monsters</a></li><li><a href="#Tempered_Monster_materials">Tempered Monster materials</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_craft_Artian_Weapons">How to craft Artian Weapons</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="What_are_Artian_Weapons_and_Tempered_Monsters_in_Monster_Hunter_Wilds">What are Artian Weapons and Tempered Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h2><p>Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons become available once you've completed Chapter 4-3: Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns. Here's a quick summary:</p><ul><li>Chapter 3-5: Monster Hunter is the conclusion of the story proper.</li><li>When you're done with the story, quests become more free-form. You simply need to take out targets and complete quests so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</li><li>Upon reaching Hunter Rank 20, you're given the Wyvern Sparks and Rose Thorns mission, which takes you back to the Ruins of Wyveria.</li><li>This leads you to a battle against a Lala Barina that you're tracking, as well as a Guardian Fulgur Anjanath, the first Tempered Monster type that you encounter.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452184"></a><figcaption>Tempered Monsters are scarred veterans of countless battles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452184-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_track_down_Tempered_Monsters">How to track down Tempered Monsters</h3><p>The Monster Hunter Wilds Tempered Monsters offer the most difficult bouts in the game. These creatures are battle-hardened, as you can see by the scars and old wounds on their bodies. They're tougher compared to normal variants, so don't underestimate them.</p><p>If you plan on tracking down a Tempered Monster, you can do so by opening the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/monster-hunter-wilds-world-map-biomes-regions/2900-6290/" data-ref-id="2900-6290"><strong>world map biomes</strong></a> to see which ones are currently active in a particular location. You'll also notice that a blue glow/waypoint leads you to these targets, as opposed to the green-colored trails for other creatures or items.</p><h3 id="Tempered_Monster_materials">Tempered Monster materials</h3><p>The reason why you want to eliminate Tempered Monsters whenever you see them is because they grant the usual loot from their species, as well as endgame materials. These are used to craft Artian Weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds--i.e. rank 6, 7, and 8 (currently the highest tier in the game).</p><p>Once you've collected enough materials, talk to Gemma at your base and select the Forge Artian Weapons option. You'll notice some key differences here.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4452186"></a><figcaption>Combine parts to come up with an Artian Weapon with a certain elemental property or status ailment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4452186-monster-hunter-wilds-tempered-monsters-artian-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_craft_Artian_Weapons">How to craft Artian Weapons</h3><p>The process of crafting Artian Weapons is vastly different compared to Low Rank or High Rank armaments. This time, you need to select three parts to develop a viable combination. Here are a few reminders:</p><ul><li>You may only select parts that have the same rarity--i.e. rank 6, 7, or 8.</li><li>Parts have an elemental property or a status ailment property.</li><li>If you pick two or more materials with the same properties, the weapon gains that effect. If all three materials have different properties, then the result will be a non-elemental gear piece.</li><li>Example: 2x Thunder and 1x Sleep results in a weapon with the Thunder element. However, if you pick 1x Thunder, 1x Sleep, and 1x Dragon, then the combination would yield a non-elemental result.</li></ul><p>It's also worth noting that weapon categories require different part classifications:</p><ul><li>Great Sword - Requires 2x blade and 1x tube.</li><li>Long Sword - Requires 1x blade and 2x tube.</li><li>Sword &amp; Shield - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x disc.</li><li>Dual Blades - Requires 2x blade and 1x disc.</li><li>Hammer - Requires 2x disc and 1x tube.</li><li>Hunting Horn - Requires 1x disc and 2x device.</li><li>Lance - Requires 1x blade and 2x disc.</li><li>Gunlance - Requires 2x disc and 1x device.</li><li>Switch Axe - Requires 2x blade and 1x device.</li><li>Charge Blade - Requires 1x blade, 1x disc, and 1x device.</li><li>Insect Glaive - Requires 1x blade, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Light Bowgun - Requires 1x tube and 2x device.</li><li>Heavy Bowgun - Requires 1x disc, 1x tube, and 1x device.</li><li>Bow - Requires 2x tube and 1x device.</li></ul><p>That does it for our Monster Hunter Tempered Monsters and Artian Weapons guide. Once you've crafted a couple of these high-end armaments, keep eliminating tougher creatures so you can continue to increase your Hunter Rank.</p><p>Soon, rarer and more difficult Tempered Monsters will appear. Of course, this also means that you'll be able to create rank 7 and, eventually, rank 8 gear pieces.</p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Star Wars: Republic Commando is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 1, 2025. Below, we look at how its focus on military fiction was a sign of things to come to the Star Wars galaxy .</em></p><p dir="ltr">When you boot up Star Wars: Republic Commando, the first thing you see is the LucasArts logo, fuzzy like a jammed radio signal. It flickers with the audio of muttered orders, of droid speak. This is an idea taken from the original Clone Wars cartoons (starting in 2003), which also opens with a distorted broadcast, in that case of blaster fire and blaring lightsabers. In tandem, these aesthetic flourishes represent a turn away from the science fantasy mythicism of Star Wars proper and a turn toward a grittier, though still exaggerated, military fiction.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, it is not as if these impulses were not in Star Wars to begin with. Though A New Hope draws on the science fiction golden age idealism of Flash Gordan serials, it is a worn down future. Our heroes are would-be guerrilla militants, piloting buckets of bolts. Their fascist enemies reserve any futurist slickness. The fight of rebels is scrappy, hidden in trees and sequestered in backwater planets.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, Han Solo and Luke Skywalker are not ordinary soldiers, but heroes (nomenclature used by a Star Wars video game contemporary to Republic Commando: Battlefront 2). The original trilogy, and to a large extent the prequels, take a similar position to war as The Lord of the Rings. Epic battles often take the forefront, and both franchises are undoubtedly concerned with war. But the heroes are not boots-on-the-ground infantry or even military commanders exactly, but kings and prodigal children. They save the world, while rebels and fascists alike die in the dirt.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando represents something more mundane: the everyday life of a soldier at war. The game's obvious principle inspiration, outside of Star Wars itself, is Halo. Like that FPS, Republic Commando goes to great pains to make its titular characters special boys, a cut above the ordinary clones who make up the rest of the Galactic Republic's army. But also, the commandos can't get up to anything too earth-shattering or else interfere with the films their game ties in with. In practical terms, the plot of Star Wars itself would not change if every one of the commandos died in a ditch. The effect is like a bit of propaganda: You are the heroes that preserve the republic, although in actuality, you are just more bodies to line the future Emperor's checkbook.</p><div tabindex="0"

Even though it was released before Episode III revealed the looming threat of Order 66, the clone troopers were still destined to become the Empire's stormtroopers. (Yes, I'm aware the Empire swaps to a more standard military recruitment strategy in its early days. To this criticism I have just one response: Shut up, nerd.) At game's end, the commandos suffer a senseless loss of their sniper, Sev, only for their Jedi commanders to order them to a new position, forcing the squad to leave their teammate behind. This is not the loss of some pawn with the same visage and personality as every one of his brothers. This is an individual loss of someone with a soul of his own, however cliched or simplistic.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this neatly anticipates Dave Filoni's The Clone Wars show, which grants whole platoons and battalions the same attention this game provided an elite squad. The game's commandos even appear in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz3wpkCt2Ms">one episode</a>, but they also are predecessors to many of The Clone Wars' original characters, especially The Bad Batch, who were first conceptualized before the series' cancelation on Cartoon Network but re-appeared as part of the series' revitalization on Disney+ and then on their own spin-off show. Like the commandos, the Bad Batch are a squad of specialized personalities defined by their skill in battle. The Bad Batch are not the first of such characters to appear in The Clone Wars, but are a small unit, defined by their relationships to each other, in a way that echoes Republic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">But The Clone Wars' sense of wartime tragedy is even more heightened. The Battle of Umbara arc follows Anakin Skywalker's 501st clone battalion after he is called away on a special mission. The general who replaces him pushes the clones toward senseless losses for a secret agenda. The whole thing is the plight of the clones in miniature. They are all dying for a cause they are incapable of actually choosing, that demands they turn against their friends and comrades with the flick of a switch.</p><p dir="ltr">The show's final run on Disney+ pushes this to its logical conclusion, dramatizing Order 66 itself. Anakin's apprentice, Ahsoka, watches her friends turn on her and she saves her mentor, Captain Rex, but the rest of the clones accompanying her die in the encounter. This could be the substance of a Metal Gear Solid backstory, as it explores the same issues: duty to your loyalties vs. the substance of your conscience, love on the battlefield or a bullet in the gut. The plight of the clone is the plight of the idealized, fictional, unreal soldier.</p><p dir="ltr">Republic Commando is hardly a serious engagement with these themes, but it's all there in uniformed shadows. Its influence is felt across the next 20 years of Star Wars, from the sometimes strict military fiction of Clone Wars to the guerrilla warfare drama of Andor to Dave Filoni's partial stewardship of the franchise (though I'll believe that Mandalorian movie is happening when I am in the theater watching it). All these examples share the same sorts of dead ends. No matter how Republic Commandos dressed itself up in blaster fire and Halo-style heroics, all that awaits its heroes is death. That's as true for them as it is for Captain Rex as it is for Andor or Anakin Skywalker.</p>
