                <p dir="ltr">Remedy Entertainment has made some of the best games of the last several years, including Alan Wake 2 and Control, and thanks to a new Humble Bundle, has made it possible to snag the studio's entire oeuvre for a ridiculously low price. The <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Nine+Remedy+PC+Games+For+Only+%2427%2C+Including+Alan+Wake+2+And+Control&amp;fnauthor=philhornshaw&amp;fndate=2025-09-19+13%3A52%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-19+16%3A39%3A26&amp;fnarticle_id=6534894&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fremedy-games-30th-anniversary-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-nine-remedy-pc-games-for-only-27-including-alan-wake-2-and-control%2F1100-6534894%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle</a> includes up to nine of the studio's game for $27. A portion of the proceeds for each bundle go to charity. In this case, it's <a href="https://www.savethechildren.org/" rel="nofollow ">Save the Children</a>, which works to improve the lives of children around the world and to help protect them when disasters strike. You can also increase your donation by choosing to pay more than the bundle price. This is an awesome deal, but you'll want to grab the bundle soon, as it's <strong>only available through October 10.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While the full $27 bundle offers the best value, the Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle offers a tiered pricing scale just like Humble's other bundle deals. The cheapest tier is just $5 and includes the arcade racer <strong>Death Rally,</strong> the gritty noir third-person shooters <strong>Max Payne</strong> and <strong>Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</strong>, and <strong>Alan Wake: American Nightmare</strong>, which is a standalone expansion to the first Alan Wake game. This tier is great if you want to check out the studio's earliest works. Death Rally is an interesting one to look back on, since it differs so much from the action and survival horror games the studio is now known for. However, the real standout of this tier are Max Payne and Max Payne 2. Both helped define the third-person shooter genre of their time, and they offer a strange, surreal story that is absolutely worth a visit. The first will be quite clunky by modern standards, but Max Payne 2 holds up pretty well thanks to its more refined storytelling.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a $12 tier that includes the four games from the previous tier, plus the <strong>Alan Wake Collector's Edition</strong>, <strong>Alan Wake Remastered</strong>, <strong>Quantum Break</strong>, and <strong>Control Ultimate Edition</strong>. At the time, the original Alan Wake was another fascinating genre departure, as Remedy blended influences like Stephen King and Twin Peaks into a unique survival horror thriller. That said, Control is probably the standout of this tier. It stands as one of the best action games of the last several years, combining the studio's penchant for supernatural sci-fi and third-person action-adventure with a giant Metroidvania-style map to explore. It's also where Remedy really turned up the dial on its universe-building and weird fiction aesthetics. Quantum Break is also worth a look, as its mix of live action storytelling and gameplay levels is an early example of ideas the studio would later iterate on with Control and Alan Wake 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571464" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571464"></a><figcaption>Humble Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4571464-remedy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of which, if you want to grab Remedy's crown jewel, Alan Wake 2, then you'll have to shell out for the full $27 bundle--but it's worth it. The $27 bundle gets you all of the games from the previous two tiers, plus <strong>Alan Wake 2 Deluxe Edition</strong> and a Humble Store coupon code for <strong>25% off Remedy's latest release, the co-op online shooter FBC: Firebreak</strong>. Alan Wake II Deluxe Edition includes the base game, the Night Springs and Lake House story expansions, and a selection of additional DLC content like costumes for the playable characters Alan and Saga. Alan Wake 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-a-miracle-illuminated/1900-6418143/" data-ref-id="1900-6418143">one of the rare games we've awarded a 10/10</a>, with GameSpot reviewer Mark Delaney saying "The mere existence of an Alan Wake 2 would have, at different points over the years, felt like a minor miracle, but for it to be this one, that feels singular in its achievements, and coming from a studio that refuses to shy away from the paths less traveled, makes Alan Wake 2 a miracle."</p><p dir="ltr">In total, you're looking at $238 worth of games for just $27. All games purchased in the Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle are delivered as official keys for either Steam or the Epic Game Store (we've labeled which games use which service in the list below). As mentioned above, the bundle will only be available through October 10.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for even more Remedy goodness, you should check out the novelizations of both Alan Wake and Quantum Break, both available on Amazon. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alan-Wake-Rick-Burroughs/dp/0765328437" rel="nofollow ">book version of Alan Wake</a> draws the story together in a way that flows a little more clearly and concretely than the game--you can't miss picking up hidden manuscript pages when you're reading a book. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0765391600" rel="nofollow ">Quantum Break: Zero State</a> is more adaptation than novelization, since it doesn't include that game's player-driven choices, and provides a different angle on the game's events and its smart approach to time travel. illuminated."</p><h2>Remedy 30th Anniversary Bundle</h2><p><strong>Pay $5 or more</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Alan Wake's American Nightmare (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Death Rally (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pay $12 or more</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Alan Wake's American Nightmare (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Alan Wake Collector's Edition (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Alan Wake Remastered (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Control Ultimate Edition (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Death Rally (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)</li><li dir="ltr">Quantum Break (Steam)</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pay $27 or more</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Alan Wake 2 - Deluxe Edition (Epic Game Store)</li><li>Alan Wake's American Nightmare (Steam)</li><li>Alan Wake Collector's Edition (Steam)</li><li>Alan Wake Remastered (Steam)</li><li>Control Ultimate Edition (Steam)</li><li>Death Rally (Steam)</li><li>Max Payne (Steam)</li><li>Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne (Steam)</li><li>Quantum Break (Steam)</li><li><strong>Coupon Code:</strong> 25% off FBC: Firebreak</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-mario-kart-deals-available-at-amazon/1100-6534885/">Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart Bundle In Stock At Amazon With Same-Day Delivery</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">Save On All Four Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Switch 2 Amiibo At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-batman-movie-and-tv-series-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-deals/1100-6533035/">Batman Movie And TV Box Sets Are Cheaper Than Prime Day Prices At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-game-amiibo-preorder-buying-guide-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530754/">Metroid Prime 4 And Samus Amiibo Preorders Available Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-games-amiibo-accessory-preorders-new-releases-2025-at-amazon/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Direct Switch 2 Preorders At Amazon - All New Games And Amiibo</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rosalinas-storybook-super-mario-galaxy-dark-horse-nintendo-book-amazon-preorder/1100-6534724/">Rosalina's Storybook From Super Mario Galaxy Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-bundle-pokemon-legends-z-a-preorder/1100-6533331/">Nintendo Switch 2 Pokemon Console Bundle Is Finally Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-joyful-dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controller-2025-preorder-guide/1100-6534678/">Astro Bot Joyful DualSense Limited Edition Controller Preorders Are Live</a></li>   </ul> </div>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Just when you thought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> already had too many battle royale modes, Epic Games goes and drops another one. The new mode, dubbed Delulu, is completely unlike any of the other battle royale variations because it does two things the others don't: It has proximity voice chat, and encourages teaming mid-game with other players not in your group. But it's also a mode where only one person comes out as the winner. Katniss and Peeta's trick with the berries will <em>not</em> work here.</p><p dir="ltr">Delulu has been a blast so far, and matches feel vaguely like Epic mashed up its normal BR with its Party Royale mode--it's a battle royale about socializing. You can use an emote specific to Delulu to join and exit other players' parties on the fly. And since teaming is allowed in this mode, nothing prevents you from collaborating with even more players after you hit the max number for a party.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the social aspect is so crucial to the purpose of this mode, you're required to have a mic, and have the in-game voice chat on and set to Everybody before you can even queue up for it. You can join a round with your friends, but everyone drops in alone, and you'll eventually have to put them down if you want to win.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571459" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4571459"></a><figcaption>Delulu is Fortnite's latest attempt to innovate with a new battle royale mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4571459-fortnitedelulu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Right now, Delulu is live on the weekend only, which means it will be available from Friday morning until Monday morning--and it's slated to return next Friday for the same span of time, too. And while it's delightful, there's a bit of a learning curve since there are some nuances to it that Fortnite itself will not explain to you, so we figured we'd take a moment to highlight three important things you should know as you drop into Fortnite Delulu.</p><h2 dir="ltr">There are no reboots in Delulu, but any play can resurrect any knocked player</h2><p dir="ltr">No matter how you play it, Delulu is a solo mode that ends each round with just one winner. So when you're dead, the round is over for you. There will be no rebooting you. <em>However</em>, Delulu players are always knocked before they die, and any other player can res you regardless of which team they're on or if they're even in a squad at all. It's possible your foes will have mercy. It's not unheard of.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The proximity chat effect applies to your squad, too</h2><p dir="ltr">Nothing about the voice chat changes when you join a squad--you'll still only be able to talk to each other when you're in range of the proximity chat, unlike the way squad comms work in normal BR modes. You'll want to keep that in mind when you find that your three teammates are all hanging out together out of your earshot--they might be planning to betray you.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Playing as a Delulu non-hostile actually works</h2><p dir="ltr">While there are people who play Delulu the same way they would any other battle royale mode, most folks seem pretty willing to engage with the social aspect and just hang out. I've had games already where we had more than a dozen players roaming the countryside until the endgame forced us to turn on each other.</p><p dir="ltr">And, yes, I've had more than a few rounds that ended very abruptly after a group of sociopathic teens pretended to be chill, only to shoot me in the face when I let them get close, but I've had very few early deaths despite taking a pacifistic approach whenever I could. The whole thing is a lot less anxiety-inducing than I expected.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Don't try to win in Delulu</h2><p dir="ltr">While I understand that being the last person standing <em>is</em> the stated purpose of Delulu, this particular BR mode is best experienced with a "let's see how this plays out" sort of view on things. It's a rare situation where you can truly say that it's more about the journey than the destination, and that's because rounds of Delulu often play out in weird and unpredictable ways. In this mode, the most fun usually occurs from doing things completely differently than you would in the other battle royale modes.</p>
