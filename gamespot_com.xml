                <p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-review/1900-6137018/" data-ref-id="1900-6137018">Guitar Hero</a> debuted in November 2005, but the franchise has been in a lull for a long time. The last game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-live-review/1900-6416284/" data-ref-id="1900-6416284">Guitar Hero Live</a>, arrived in 2015 and there hasn't been any concrete word about a new title since. However, the Guitar Hero fandom lives on in 2025, and there's a new controller coming to the Wii later this month.</p><p>Hyperkin has announced that an updated version of the company's Wii Guitar is up for preorder ahead of its release date, January 8. It's called the Hyper Strummer, and it includes support for Wii's Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles, with the exception of the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rock-band-review/1900-6184123/" data-ref-id="1900-6184123">Rock Band</a> game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">New Year, New Wii... Guitars. Introducing the HYPER STRUMMER! An updated model of our previous Wii Guitar, we have been working hard and wanted to give you a little surprise of what is to come this year! The HyperStrummer is set to pre orders start NOW! <a href="https://t.co/e82FJN6bCk" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/e82FJN6bCk</a></p>  — Hyperkin (@Hyperkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At $77, the Hyper Strummer is somewhat pricey. But it was made to resemble the classic Guitar Hero controllers. It's also powered by the Wii remote, so players won't need to pickup any batteries for this controller. It's unclear how many Guitar Hero or Rock Band players are still using the Wii in 2025, but presumably Hyperkin took that into account before committing to this project. </p><p>Because Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard, the company now controls the fate of any future Guitar Hero games. Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-says-he-passed-on-acquiring-so-many-games-including-destiny-and-guitar-hero/1100-6526241/" data-ref-id="1100-6526241">that he passed on Guitar Hero</a> before it became a breakout hit. In 2022, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick noted that he and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-guitar-hero-come-back-under-microsoft-kotick-says-the-xbox-company-has-resources-to-do-it/1100-6499764/" data-ref-id="1100-6499764">Spencer had discussions about bringing Guitar Hero back</a>, but we haven't heard anything new about those talks since then. Guitar Hero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024-video-game-hall-of-fame-finalists-include-metroid-resident-evil-and-guitar-hero/1100-6521847/" data-ref-id="1100-6521847">was also one of the finalists</a> to be added to 2024's class at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame/2900-5170/" data-ref-id="2900-5170">Strong Museum's Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. However, the game wasn't among the titles selected for that year.</p>

                <p>The Warrior is a classic ARPG class that features some ground-shattering skills in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2.</a> However, in the beginning stages of early access, many players are already calling for buffs to the Warrior due to the sluggishness of its abilities and weaker attacks in the endgame. While the Warrior very well may get buffed in the future, its currently designed for more advanced Path of Exile players.</p><p>Of course, if you follow the right build guide, it won't matter how much time you have played in the series. Below, you'll find the only viable Warrior build in the current state of Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>Warrior Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As you might expect, the Warrior is the definition of a melee class in Path of Exile 2. The class' main damage dealers are two-handed weapons like mauls and maces, which each come with skills of their own. However, players are allowed to switch things up and make use of a one-handed weapon along with a shield if they're looking to play more defensively. Shields also has its own defensive skill that allows you to block attacks, but you won't deal as much damage with this kind of build.</p><p>Fortunately, Path of Exile 2 allows you to swap freely between two different builds. So, you can have a two-handed weapon on one build and a one-handed weapon/shield on another build. This allows you to easily change up your playstyle depending on whether offensive or defensive strategies are required for a certain fight. You can also dual-wield one-handed weapons and this does come into play with certain skills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247"></a><figcaption>A club and shield will be your starting weapons as a Warrior</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png"></figure><p>Generally, though, the best build for a Warrior in Path of Exile 2 relies on dealing damage with two-handed weapons, as it's very easy to get overwhelmed by mobs or bosses if you try to get too defensive.</p><p>As a Warrior, you'll want to put as many attribute points as possible into Strength. The other two attributes, Dexterity and Intelligence, won't come into play too much unless you want to be a more nimble Warrior. In that case, putting some points into Dexterity could be a good idea for certain gear.</p><h2>Best Warrior Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>With the overview of the Warrior out of the way, it's time to talk skills. The Warrior has access to a wide variety of powerful attacks, but the main downfall of a lot of them is their overall slowness. You'll find yourself mashing buttons trying to get attacks off quicker, but the Warrior is simply a sluggish class that takes plenty of patience.</p><p>For the most part, the Warrior relies on AoE damage to hurt and kill enemies. You'll want to stay as close as possible to enemies to inflict the most damage possible, but this also means you'll be taking more damage in return. This is where swapping back between different weapons and your shield can come into play. Using an AoE attack and then changing to a shield to survive enemies that weren't killed and repeating the process is an effective gameplay loop you'll find yourself using.</p><p>Below, you can find the skills we recommend for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Mace Strike</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Boneshatter</li><li>Shockwave Totem</li><li>Infernal Cry</li><li>Leap Slam</li><li>Sunder</li><li>Ancestral Warrior Totem</li><li>Hammer of the Gods</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248"></a><figcaption>All skills for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png"></figure><p>The best Warrior build really can't come to fruition until you complete Act 3 on standard difficulty in Path of Exile 2. The build's best skills don't come until after you get into the acts again on Cruel difficulty. Skills like Sunder, Ancestral Warrior Totem, and Hammer of the Gods are quite effective for mobs and bosses but are unlocked late.</p><p>As such, using skills like Earthquake, Boneshatter, Shockwave Tote, and Infernal Cry is going to be your best bet for the early game in Acts 1-3. The build really picks up when you unlock Leap Slam, which pairs perfectly with Bone Shatter and a two-handed weapon. You can use these two skills in concert to deal massive damage and also avoid enemy attacks in the process. Also, using Infernal Cry before performing a combo will only boost the damage you deal, so make sure you're spamming that as much as possible.</p><p>In the early game, Mace Strike is an effective way to clear mobs, but it slowly gets out-paced by other skills. Earthquake, Boneshatter, and Shockwave Totem are decent skills that deal AoE damage, but they take a while to get off.</p><h2>Best Warrior Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>Moving on with your build, your next task is to equip your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill Gems</a> with the right Support Gems as well as equip some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> to grant you persistent buffs during combat.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Martial Tempo (all skills, but Leap Slam specifically)</li><li>Momentum (Leap Slam)</li><li>Holy Descent (Leap Slam)</li><li>Magnified Effect (all skills, but Earthquake/Shockwave Totem specifically)</li><li>Impact Shockwave (Boneshatter)</li><li>Brutality</li><li>Fist of War (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Primal Armament (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Supercritical (Sunder)</li><li>Concentrated Effect (Sunder)</li><li>Premeditation (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Raging Cry (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Rage</li><li>Deep Cuts (Mace Strike)</li><li>Heft (Mace Strike/Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Font of Rage (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li><li>Splinter (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Overwhelming Presence</li><li>Scavenged Plating</li></ul><h2>Best Warrior Passive Skills</h2><p>As you level up with the Warrior, you'll gain one Passive Point to allocate to the Passive Ability Skill Tree. The Warrior's skill tree is fairly straightforward, as you want to mainly put points toward Strength, physical damage, and AoE damage.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Warrior:</p><ul><li>Brutal</li><li>Sturdy Metal</li><li>Smash</li><li>Unstoppable Barrier</li><li>Blade Catcher</li><li>Beef</li><li>Sudden Infuriation</li><li>Lasting Trauma</li><li>Skullcrusher</li><li>Split the Earth</li><li>Resolute Technique</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249"></a><figcaption>The Warrior's Passive Ability Skill Tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png"></figure><p>You'll also want to put points into different Strength attribute nodes wherever you can, as the Warrior can never have too much of it.</p><h2>Best Warrior Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the Warrior's Ascendancy, which you can choose after slogging through the leveling process with the class. There are two choices for the Warrior's Ascendancy, which are: The Titan and Warbringer.</p><p>The key difference between the two Ascendancies is what you want to prioritize. The Titan is more about dealing damage while the Warbringer has some more defensive-minded abilities that help you survive against large mobs and bosses. With the current state of the Warrior being a little weaker, we recommend the Warbringer. You can take advantage of abilities like the Jade Heritage skill to absorb damage without it affecting your HP, making boss fights much more bearable.</p><p>However, in the future, the Titan Ascendancy will likely be the stronger pick after some buffs to the Warrior as a whole.</p>

                <p>It's a big day for Call of Duty, as the new Squid Game collaboration launches today, January 3, alongside a significant update across Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision has now posted the full patch notes, revealing all the significant changes and updates--and there are many.</p><p>Across Black Ops 6, Zombies, and Warzone, all mantle speeds have been increased, while doors can now be opened and close while sprinting. Additionally, the Cleaver melee weapon is now available to unlock through the new Squid Game event reward in the new event pass, which costs 1,100 COD Points for the premium track.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ja0LKjA4lxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ja0LKjA4lxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Activision warned that some players might see their Operator selections and customizations reset with the new update. Activision didn't say why this is occurring or what players can do about it beyond just starting over.</p><p>There are a bunch of new Squid Game-themed multiplayer modes available now in Black Ops 6, including Red Light, Green Light and one called Roulette Handgun. This mode allows players to obtain a powerful handgun that comes with the risk of killing the player, as each shot has a chance to blow up the weapon and the player.</p><p>There are no weapon-balance adjustments, but Black Ops 6's Scorestreaks are getting new tuning updates. This includes a reduction in max damage for the RC-XD and Care Packages now containing fewer Scout Pulses. The Sentry Turret, meanwhile, sees increases to its HP and fire rate, while the Watchdog Helo's damage is increased as well.</p><p>For Zombies, there is a new Squid Game mode called Dead Light, Green Light where players try to rack up zombie kills during the Green Light phase. When Red Light is called, any player who moves has essence drained from them. And when the Dead Light phase kicks in, players face off against increasingly difficult waves of zombies.</p><p>In Warzone, the January 3 patch fixes a number of bugs, including an error that would prevent the exfil animation to play during Ranked Play. The update also fixes an issue that incorrectly stopped players from using an Advanced UAV in some scenarios, and another issue pertaining to money drops.</p><p>The January 3 patch also brings a Squid Game mode to Warzone's Urzikstan map. This comes in the form of a rotating series of challenges, with teams eliminated each round until only one remains. Additionally, Red Light, Green Light can be triggered between rounds.</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-01-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a></p><p>As for Squid Game, the second season of the popular Netflix series is out now. Season 3 is set for release later this year.</p><h2>Friday, January 3, 2025</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Movement</h4><ul><li>Increased all mantle speeds.</li><li>Doors can now be opened and closed while sprinting.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>New Cleaver Melee weapon now available via Event rewards.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s view could become obstructed with specific weapons when using the Dark Practitioner Tracer Pack Bundle without an optic.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens would not be visible on the Saug Mecha-Drake Mastercraft Blueprint.</li><li>Hawker Hybrid optic now correctly works with the Ginger Dread Blueprint.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Improved AAR flow.  <ul><li>Added a Dismiss button to exit at any point and a timer.</li><li>Added a Summary at the end.</li></ul></li><li>Improved readability when searching for a match.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Gun Screens could not be previewed.</li></ul><p>NOTE: Some players may see their Operator selections and Operator customizations reset after this update.</p><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light (NEW)</b><ul><li>Young-hee is watching, so don’t misstep at the wrong time. Get on the pitch in the Red Card stadium and play three rounds of Red Light, Green Light, each two minutes long.</li><li>In Round 1, no one gets a weapon. In Rounds 2 and 3, you can pick up weapons on the ground and eliminate other competitors with melee attacks and Finishing Moves. There’s just one simple rule: When Young-hee says “Green Light,” the fight is on. Move a muscle after she says “Red Light” and you’re toast.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Pentathlon (NEW)</b><ul><li>Prove that you have what it takes in the long run by competing in a series of Multiplayer modes to find out who reigns supreme! Play Domination, Kill Confirmed, and Hardpoint along with two new mode variants: Piggy Bank Team Deathmatch and Roulette.  <ul><li>In Piggy Bank TDM, every elimination adds score to the Mega Piggy Bank; fight for possession of the huge payout when it drops part way through the match.</li><li>In Roulette, one-shot eliminations via the Roulette Handgun award double the points, though with each fired shot there’s a chance it’ll blow up in your hands!</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Squid Game Moshpit (NEW)</b><ul><li>Fire up the Squid Game Moshpit including Team Deathmatch, Domination, and Hardpoint with a twist as players gain access to three important Squid Game-themed features:  <ul><li>Red Light, Green Light Scorestreak: Is the fight getting too hectic for you? Stop the enemy in their tracks with this Scorestreak that calls “Red Light,” commanding all enemy players to stop moving or risk elimination.</li><li>Piggy Bank: Eliminated players have a chance of dropping a Piggy Bank that awards a small score boost when picked up. For a bigger payday, watch for the Mega Piggy Bank. Every elimination adds additional score to the Mega Piggy Bank, so once it drops, fight for it to acquire all the deposited score within.</li><li>Roulette Handgun: The epitome of high risk, high reward. The Roulette Handgun spawns in the center of the map; grab it to activate a permanent UAV effect while wielding it and land one-shot eliminations against enemies, earning more than double the normal score to help you obtain Scorestreaks more quickly. The catch? Your location will be marked for everyone to see, and every shot has a chance to blow up the weapon, taking you down with it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Prop Hunt</b><ul><li>Improved spatial audio on Prop whistles.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Prop UI could remain present when switching rounds to the Hunter team.</li><li>Addressed an issue where Props could block doors from opening when locked in place.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Wildcards</h4><ul><li><b>High Roller (NEW)</b><ul><li>Allows players to equip up to four Scorestreaks.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Scorestreaks</h4><ul><li><b>RC-XD</b><ul><li>Slightly reduced the RC-XD’s max damage.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Archangel Launcher</b><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue where the next bullet fired from a weapon after using the Archangel Launcher could be an Archangel rocket.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Care Package</b><ul><li>Care Packages will now contain the Scout Pulse Scorestreak less frequently.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>LDBR</b><ul><li>Decreased the damage the LDBR does to its owner.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 950 to 800.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Sentry Turret</b><ul><li>Increased Sentry Turret fire rate.</li><li>Increased Sentry Turret HP.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1000 to 950.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Hellstorm</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1050 to 1000.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Watchdog Helo</b><ul><li>Slightly increased the Watchdog Helo’s damage.</li><li>Increased Watchdog Helo accuracy when it acquires a new target.</li><li>Reduced score requirement from 1100 to 1050.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Strategic Bomber</b><ul><li>Reduced score requirement from 1300 to 1100.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>A.G.R.

                <p>Amazon has started canceling preorders for the Nintendo 3DS version of Mighty No. 9, a game that was released almost 10 years ago. Developed by Comcept and former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune, Mighty No. 9 was billed as a spiritual successor to Mega Man.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qsxliyc2vtv2ljcp33e4ta3y?ref_src=embed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky user</a>, Amazon UK sent a notification to them saying that their preorder for Mighty No. 9 on Nintendo 3DS was canceled due to the lack of availability. Surprisingly, this user placed the order in 2022, indicating that people were still able to preorder this version of Mighty No. 9 years after it came out on other platforms.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was funded via Kickstarter and became one of the most infamous funding campaigns in video game history. The 3DS and PS Vita versions were added as stretch goals for the campaign if it hit <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/27/4777614/mighty-no-9-stretch-goal-ps-vita-3ds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$3.5 million, which it ended up reaching</a>.</p><p>Mighty No. 9 was released in <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mighty-no-9/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 for PC, PS3, PS4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and Xbox One</a>. However, it looks like the 3DS and Vita versions will never come to fruition. Inafune has since moved on to other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-times-new-trailer-shows-off-new-jobs-and-island-customization/1100-6519560/" data-ref-id="1100-6519560">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, which is set to release sometime in 2025.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mighty-no-9-review/1900-6416453/" data-ref-id="1900-6416453">Mighty No. 9 review</a>, we said, "For a game that's meant to bear the legacy of a classic series, Mighty No. 9 barely succeeds.
