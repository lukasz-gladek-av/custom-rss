                <p>Since its release in 2020, there have been a number of small DLC releases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/crusader-kings-3-review-pass-the-duchy/1900-6417551/" data-ref-id="1900-6417551">Crusader Kings 3</a>. But few have inspired the overwhelmingly bad word of mouth that the recently dropped Coronations has received on Steam. Players aren't just disappointed in this release, they're angry as well. Now, PDS Black QA Manager has come forward to apologize to players and accept the blame for the DLC's broken state.</p><p>The QA Manager, Riad, shared his message on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/517472660906573991" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> alongside update 1.17.0.1, which is meant to fix some of the players' complaints. Coronations added the ability for players to have their rulers crowned in an official ceremony, and introduced oaths made to the people of their kingdom. However, many of the oaths are either incredibly difficult to achieve, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1nd6c2j/i_completed_my_oath_years_ago_wtf_paradox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game simply didn't register them as complete</a>. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3315520/Crusader_Kings_III_Coronations/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam reviews for Coronations have been merciless</a>, and the response is currently marked as "overwhelmingly negative."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFLHnwXwouE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SFLHnwXwouE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I'm sorry," wrote Riad. "Coronations was not up to the standard you deserve, and that's on me. As the QA Manager for the studio, it is my job to ensure that our releases meet the [quality assurance] vision we have set out. It is clear we didn't give the project the resources and attention it needed, and the result was a release that let you down. You have every right to be upset, and I want to acknowledge that openly."</p><p>Riad went on to explain that most of Paradox's resources are going towards a massive Crusader Kings 3 expansion called All Under Heaven. That left Coronations with fewer resources and ultimately led to it launching with the oath mechanics broken, which Riad attributed to "last minute" changes. He reiterated a desire to do better for fans while earning their trust back.</p><p>Steam user Mewzle wrote a direct response to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974947850/recommended/3315520/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Riad</a>, noting that they had purchased every previous DLC for the game and given the developer the benefit of the doubt. Mewzle was emphatic about no longer feeling that way for Paradox.</p><p>"If you really feel this way Paradox, then integrate this garbage into the main game, and STOP producing garbage like this that alienates your player base. This is NOT $5 worth of content and you know it. The modding community could create (and has created) something better than this slop in five minutes and not make a dime ... Again, if you truly want to be better, then be better."</p><p>One of the first listed changes in the 1.17.0.1 update targets the mistaken Oathbreaker event that came up whether players fulfilled their oaths or not. The rest of the fixes can be found below.</p><h3>Bugfixes</h3><ul><li>Fixed the issue with always getting the Oathbreaker event, regardless of if you completed the oath or not</li><li>The buildings needed for the three "build special oath buildings" oaths have been changed from tier 3 to tier 2</li><li>The special oath buildings have had their costs and modifiers reduced across the board</li><li>The special oath buildings have had some of their triggers simplified, so they need fewer of their requirements than they used to</li><li>These oaths have also had the time you can do them increased from 10 years to 20 years</li><li>Specifically for the spiritual one, switched the requirements from tier 3 to 2, and vice versa</li><li>The Alliance oath has been changed from 5 alliances needed to 3</li><li>Building Oath (the generic one) has been reduced from 10 buildings to 8, and the time available to do it has been increased (from 15 years to 20)</li><li>Legendary Hunt has been changed from 3 to 1, and has had the time available increased (from 20 years to 40)</li><li>Fixed the Prepare Heir oath decision, so it checks for the proper scope in its requirements, and also removed the gold cost</li><li>Added two new modifiers for the AI, so if they choose a warlike oath, they will have an increased war chance, and similarly, if they have the peace oath, they will have a peace oath, which will decrease their war chance</li><li>Removed health bonuses and maluses from Prepare the Heir rewards</li><li>Added extra checks for the AI so they will try to take oaths that make sense</li><li>Fixed the End the Struggle oath, so it correctly tells you which struggle area it is targeting, and massively increased the time it is available to you (from 20 years to 50)</li><li>Increased the time available to do the Repent Oath from 10 years to 20 years</li><li>Fixed Anointment Doctrines and Anointment activity type being available to faiths with Temporal Head of Faith (these are for Spiritual HoF faiths only); temporal HoF faiths have guaranteed access to regular coronation instead</li><li>Fixed duplication bugs and self-crowning malus caused by temporal HoF being Coronation host</li><li>Blocked the building oaths for Nomads and Tribals</li></ul><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has only been out for a little over a week, and this sequel is putting up some crazy numbers. Silksong <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">pulled in five million players in just a few days</a>, and that's without any mobile options. There isn't an official mobile port of Silksong yet, but there is a way you can play your Steam cloud saves on your Android phone.</p><p>As seen on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776180/hollow-knight-silksong-android-phone-windows-emulation-gamehub" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, GameSir's newly released GameHub version 5.0 emulates Windows so well that Silksong is playable on Android phones. As alluded above, players can access their saved games from Steam and essentially pick up where they left off at home.</p><p>There are some drawbacks to using GameHub to continue your Silksong adventures. For one thing, it's not currently possible to make a save on GameHub that can be uploaded to Steam. That's an issue GameSir is currently trying to solve. Silksong also proved to be very taxing on Android, and it achieved the best results when attached to a cooling plate and fan that allowed the game to hit 100 fps.</p><p>Silksong isn't the only game that can be played through GameHub, but The Verge notes that other titles have had some issues with version 5.0. In the meantime, a group that previously ported Hollow Knight to Android is already making <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nd76gs/hollow_knight_silksong_is_getting_a_port_to/#lightbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an unofficial Android port for Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. The team hopes to have that port ready to go in a month.</p><p>Over 7% of active Steam users reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-pc-players-are-locked-the-hell-in/1100-6534663/" data-ref-id="1100-6534663">played Silksong on its release date</a>, September 4. For the same day, it hit No. 3 on Steam behind only Helldivers II and Counter-Strike 2. Steam's full rankings for the first week of September will be released on September 15, and then we'll know if Silksong managed to reach top position.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>In 2014, the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/endless-legend/" data-ref-id="5000-245353">Endless Legend</a> was a turn-based 4X fantasy-strategy game that sent players to a world called Auriga. Later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/endless-legend-2/" data-ref-id="5000-659502">Endless Legend 2</a> is charting a course for an oceanic world named Saiadha. Now, developer Amplitude Studios has revealed that Endless Legend 2 will be a day one release on PC Game Pass as it hits early access.</p><p>Earlier this year, Amplitude Studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/10-years-later-endless-legend-2-revealed-with-an-unsettling-first-trailer/1100-6528971/" data-ref-id="1100-6528971">announced this sequel with an unsettling trailer</a> that suggests the planet is a prison for an unnamed god-like entity and that the oceans are its chains. The "god" narrating the trailer was also confident that one of the warring factions would be foolish enough to release it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQsBo9g5Ues" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bQsBo9g5Ues" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Endless Legend 2 gives players the option to pick from six different factions and races as they strive to dominate the ever-changing landscape of Saiadha. Their actions will determine how quickly the players' faction is able to expand the reach of their territory at the expense of their rivals. Players will be able to control four factions during the game's early access period, with two more factions to follow when the game gets its full release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/endless-legend-2-demo-out-now-for-one-week-only/1100-6533832/" data-ref-id="1100-6533832">demo for Endless Legend 2</a> was available for a few days in August, but only two of the factions were playable at that time. It was described as a "limited" version of the final game, and featured two cataclysmic tidefalls that reshape the world, as well as 15 minor factions to encounter, and the opportunity to face the Necrophage, a monstrous insectoid-like people who can infect other races with their plague to transform them into one of their own.</p><p>Endless Legend 2's early access release will begin on September 22.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
