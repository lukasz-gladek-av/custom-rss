                <p>I'll be real: Now that I think about it, the trick I'm about to talk about is <em>incredibly </em>obvious. So I'm begging you, please don't judge me too harshly and appreciate the fact that I am majorly humbling myself by writing about this. And, for those of you who also didn't realize you could do this, rest assured that you are in good-ish company.</p><p>Earlier this year, Fields of Mistria's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fields-of-mistrias-second-major-update-march-2025/2900-6312/" data-ref-id="2900-6312">second major update</a> was released, bringing with it the lava caves biome. And did you know that, unlike me, you don't have to use your watering can and desperately hop around the cave's various rock formations to progress through it? In a post shared on the official Field of Mistria Instagram, the team behind the game revealed that players can use the game's rain spell to instantly solidify every single inch of lava on the floor. That's right. All of it. And although this feat takes a lot of mana if you want to do it on multiple levels, man oh man, it changes things--and saves my poor stamina bar.</p><p>Admittedly, I haven't played nearly as much Fields of Mistria since the game's second update dropped--I blame the absolutely wild number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2025/2900-6127/" data-ref-id="2900-6127">phenomenal games that have come out this year</a> for that. For this reason, I think I'm a <em>little</em> more justified in not picking up on this sooner. But as someone who delights in games that force you to think about things in more roundabout way (ie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paranormasight-the-seven-mysteries-of-honjo/" data-ref-id="5000-582009">Paranormasight</a>, etc.), I am kicking myself for not considering that I could use the rain spell down in the mines.</p><p>While this is probably the biggest "oh god, you can do that" to come from Mistria's Instagram page, I also highly recommend checking out all the other tips, too. For example, did you know that if you feed a mimic items, it will spit out valuable resources and simply disappear? I've also noticed quite a few folks who have struggled a bit with the slimes that shoot rocks at you down there. The trick to besting them? Swing your sword at the right time and send those rocks hurling right back at 'em; just two good shots should do it.</p><p>While NPC Studios remains hard at work on the already fantastic farming simulator, we at GameSpot are continuing to chug away on our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fields-of-mistria/guides/">Field of Mistria guides</a>. Right now, it's one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/most-anticipated-games-leaving-early-access-in-2025/2900-6151/" data-ref-id="2900-6151">most anticipated games</a> that's scheduled to leave early access in 2025.</p>

                <p>Former Xbox-console-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/forza-horizon-5/" data-ref-id="5000-533238">Forza Horizon 5</a> sounds like it will run great on the PlayStation 5, and will be particularly impressive for those playing on PS5 Pro, according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-forza-horizon-5-rolls-onto-ps5-and-ps5-pro-the-df-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the PS5 version of the open-world racer that first released in 2021 isn't set to release on PlayStation 5 until April 29, the performance-breakdown wizards at Digital Foundry have already put the PS5 version of Forza Horizon 5 through its paces ahead of its release. The good news: They largely have nothing but positive things to say.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82ceExNpBQA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/82ceExNpBQA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While its visual performance on the base PS5 seems nearly identical to its performance on Xbox Series X|S (Digital Foundry says there's virtually no visual distinction and that they struggled to differentiate the two side-by-side), that's still an achievement given the series the franchise's ForzaTech engine has never run on PlayStation devices before. The game runs at a constant 30fps in quality mode and a steady 60fps during performance mode, and Digital Foundry says developer Panic Button's PS5 port is a "near-perfect match" to the Xbox Series X|S version.</p><p dir="ltr">It's playing the game on the PS5 Pro where the real differences can be seen. Digital Foundry notes that there is a "huge difference" in the amount of foliage when playing on PS5 Pro while running Forza Horizon 5 in performance mode. Greenery is denser and more vibrant, and can also be seen in higher detail from farther away with less pop-in. The foliage rendering while in performance mode closely matches that of the foliage on display on the base PS5's quality mode, meaning PS5 Pro players get the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">"Getting quality mode foliage at performance mode frame rates is a huge bonus for Pro users, and provides a big visual boost over the base machine," Digital Foundry said.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few other perks for those playing on PS5 Pro as well, such as ray-traced self-vehicle reflections while playing in quality mode during normal gameplay--a feature that is normally only available while using the garage and Forzavista feature on base consoles. Digital Foundry found the reflections "noticeable" for those looking for it, but that it isn't hugely impactful. Overall, Digital Foundry called playing Forza Horizon 5 on the PS5 Pro a "compromise-free experience."

Developer Playground Games and Turn 10 Studio's racing series is just the latest first-party Xbox game to make the jump to Sony's consoles, with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-is-doing-phenomenally-on-ps5-sells-1-million-copies-already-report/1100-6526047/" data-ref-id="1100-6526047">Sea of Thieves</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, having also been released on PlayStation.</p>

A report said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a>, and now one of the game's original designers, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/16256/bruce-nesmith/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bruce Nesmith</a>, has commented on what he'd like to see from it.</p><p>Nesmith told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-3-designer-expects-remaster-to-heavily-revise-gunplay/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20250423" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a> that he'd like to see Fallout 3's gunplay improved upon to make it more like Fallout 4's. "[Fallout 3 combat] didn't hold up to shooters at the time," he said. "Also, it's an RPG shooter; it's not a run-and-gun shooter. But a lot of work was done on that for Fallout 4. So I anticipate seeing a lot of that work go into it, assuming they're doing the same thing."</p><p>Nesmith pointed out that Fallout 3 marked Bethesda's first big stab at a shooter-style game, and the gunplay was not ideal.</p><p>A Fallout 3 remaster could also beef up the visuals of the 2008 game, Nesmith said. The Oblivion remaster didn't just make the game visually in line with the 2011 version of Skyrim--it exceeded it, Nesmith said. He said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-oblivion-dev-reacts-to-oblivion-remastered-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/1100-6531057/" data-ref-id="1100-6531057">pleasantly surprised by the work that went into Oblivion Remastered.</a></p><p>A report said the rumored Fallout 3 remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">would not launch for a long time</a>, so anyone hoping to play it soon should probably give up hope about that.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bethesda Game Studios plans to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>--so it's not going to launch soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Oblivion Remastered is currently on sale for 17% off at GameSpot sister-site Fanatical (both GameSpot and Fanatical are owned by Fandom).</p><p>In other Fallout news, new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-fallout-76-update-is-live-letting-players-finally-become-a-ghoul/1100-6530194/">Fallout 76 finally allows players to become Ghouls</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> has introduced quite a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-and-different-in-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/">new features and improvements</a> to Cyrodiil, but one classic feature from the original 2006 version of the game has undeniably remained: extremely cursed character faces.</p><p dir="ltr">To be fair, most of the horrifying faces in the original Oblivion belonged to NPCs. Player-characters often ended up looking a bit off as well, but the player-character's face wasn't featured as prominently in the original game as it is in the remaster, nor was third-person mode as polished as it is in the latest version of the game, so the game's wonky NPC faces tended to overshadow whatever horrors players put together in the character creator. In Oblivion Remastered, however, many of the game's NPCs have had glow-ups, while the game's character creator has given players more flexibility to turn the Hero of Kvatch into an utter monstrosity. There's even a subreddit where players can share said monstrosities: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OblivionAbominations/" rel="nofollow ">/r/OblivionAbominations</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Oblivion Remastered's updated character creator makes it far easier for players to create <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6aau5/i_made_a_beautiful_orc_lady/" rel="nofollow ">visually appealing characters</a>, but it also makes it easier for players to create characters that are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k6becp/you_are_the_one_from_my_dreams/" rel="nofollow ">pure nightmare fuel</a>. Almost immediately following the game's surprise release, social media started filling up with screenshots of player-character designs that make <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/167oww7/why_do_the_characters_look_like_that_im_scared/" rel="nofollow ">the bug-eyed NPCs</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">Starfield</a> look downright friendly. Here are some of our favorites.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Sir Vancelot</h3><p>Arguably the most popular horrifying player-character, Sir Vancelot has started appearing all over social media since his creator first shared him.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Dumb and Dunmer</h3><p>This delightfully horrifying dark elf is truly the stuff of nightmares.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Shrek</h3><p>This particular orc (...that <em>is</em> an orc, right?) is giving off major "Shrek had a few too many filler injections" vibes.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Yu-Gi-Oh My God</h3><p>It's nothing if not accurate.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Janker</h3><p>Some men just want to watch the Oblivion Gate burn.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Not-So-Handsome Squidward</h3><p>Someone free him from his suffering.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Jimmy No-Tron</h3><p>Depends on one's definition of gorgeous.</p><h3 dir="ltr">Orange-In-Chief</h3><p dir="ltr">"This is a really, really great Oblivion player-character. The best, really terrific. No fake news here. Other player-characters? Losers! Total disasters. Everyone agrees. Believe me."</p><h3 dir="ltr">I Have No Eyes And I Must Flush</h3><p>50% orc, 50% sleep-paralysis demon.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Crimson Chin Deathclaw</h3><p>He looks even more hilarious with his armor on.</p><p dir="ltr">Which Oblivion abomination is your favorite?

                <p dir="ltr">If you don't play games on PC (or even if you do), you might not know that there's been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=parkour" rel="nofollow ">a run on parkour games</a> for a while now. All of these also compete with games like Roblox and Fortnite, where parkour sims carve out a major aspect of the user-generated worlds on display. But one of these parkour games stands out above the rest: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rooftops-and-alleys/" data-ref-id="5000-612233">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's both the highest-rated parkour game on Steam (among those with more than just a handful of reviews) and has the most Steam reviews by far, with 96% of its nearly 5,000 user reviews giving the game the illustrious "Overwhelmingly Positive" distinction on the digital storefront. Soon, it'll be leaving early access and coming to consoles as well, with a 1.0 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S scheduled for June 17.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGtD2Kz2tH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nGtD2Kz2tH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time with the game, it was quickly apparent how much solo developer Michel Losch drew inspiration from the past. The arena-like maps and the ability to freely go wherever and chain together stylish moves felt like something right out of a classic Tony Hawk game. One of its maps, The Shed, seems to intentionally invoke imagery of Tony Hawk's beloved warehouse level. Still, I agreed with Losch's assessment that the physics and required stick skills of his game end up landing Rooftops &amp; Alleys (R&amp;A) somewhere in the middle of Tony Hawk and the more sim-like Skate series from EA.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, none of R&amp;A is performed on boards either, so it also gave me Mirror's Edge vibes (albeit, in third-person, not first-person), and Losch name-dropped Jet Set Radio Future as another inspiration. Like DICE's classic dystopian freerunning game, high-level play in R&amp;A looks so effortlessly cool, and even a beginner like me can appear skilled and stylish--provided they don't skip the tutorial. And much like Jet Set Radio Future, that sense of style in R&amp;A's gameplay extends beyond movement to influence the audiovisual experience--playable characters offer lots of colorful customization, and there's an eclectic soundtrack that Losch and his fiancée produced together.</p><p dir="ltr">I was both impressed and, at times, intimidated by the game's mechanics. Any one move itself was easy to perform, but the real magic of parkour is chaining together a long sequence of maneuvers, which wasn't as easy to pull off. Not that I'm complaining--the upward skill slope was an enjoyable climb, culminating in an incredible sense of flow when it all briefly came together (I tended to see my character come crashing down eventually).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109"></a><figcaption>The Shed map reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk's famous warehouse level.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the true test, though, I handed the controller off to my 12-year-old son, who would probably prefer I describe him as a (virtual) parkour expert. He loved what he played and felt like, while it was more challenging than something like Parkour Reborn on Roblox--which is more like a Spider-Man sim anyway, if you ask me--he appreciated the intricacies of the controls, and how the things you could do in the game very much resemble the reality of parkour. Rooftops &amp; Alleys doesn't seem like it will stray too far from that reality, for now anyway, and instead equips players with the tools to perform feats that parkour athletes can accomplish in the real world. Maybe some future update will send players to the moon, but, for now, it's all intentionally grounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Since debuting in Steam Early Access, the game has received 30 updates, Losch told me, including two additional maps, lots of challenges, several multiplayer modes (such as Tag and Capture The Flag), and numerous enhancements to the game's foundational movement mechanics. But the game's next milestone is maybe its most important.</p><p dir="ltr">"1.0 will be the biggest update yet," Losch said. "The game will get its sixth map, a brand-new online multiplayer game mode (Tricks Battle), a lot of new time trials and trick rush challenges, new music, over 100 different customization options, a full progression system with unlockables, fun achievements, improved gameplay mechanics--such as the brand new physical sliding mechanic, which is purely momentum-based--and an amazing photo mode which I honestly could not be more proud of!"</p><p dir="ltr">To date, R&amp;A has sold more than 150,000 copies, which isn't half bad when you consider Losch set out to pursue game dev as a passion project on the side of his 15-year career as a music producer and DJ. "[2023] marked the beginning of my solo game dev journey, so I had to learn Unreal Engine from scratch and overcome many hurdles that previously kept me from going for it and making my dream parkour game," he told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110"></a><figcaption>Rooftops and Alleys is not a game where you can hold a button to auto-parkour in style.

He continued, "I have been craving a good parkour game my entire life [...] I think I honestly got lucky in the sense that my personal taste and itch for a certain pParkour game seemed to have been aligned overall with the [genre's] community and players."</p><p dir="ltr">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game gets its Steam 1.0 update and debuts on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 17.</p>

                <p>EA officially <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/gridiron-notes-madden-26-pre-order-details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced Madden NFL 26</a> today, and this new entry brings the biggest platform-availability shake-up that the football game series has seen in years.</p><p>When Madden NFL 26 launches in August, it will only be on the current generation of consoles and PC. Nearly five years into the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S's lifespan, EA has finally decided to drop the PS4 and Xbox One versions. 2013's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-169790">Madden NFL 25</a> was the first game in the series to release on PS4 and Xbox One, and every annual release in the series has been available on those platforms until this year.</p><p>Additionally, Madden NFL 26 will be the first game in the series to be released on Nintendo Switch 2. EA teased this during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Direct unveiling the console</a> earlier this month, but we now have official confirmation. It's the first Madden game to be released on a Nintendo platform since Madden NFL 13 in 2012. Considering Madden is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">best-selling games every year</a>, a shift in platform availability like this is significant.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIp9SMjNH1w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EIp9SMjNH1w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>College Football 26, which was announced alongside Madden NFL 26 and will launch on July 10, is currently only slated for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. This was also the case with last year's game.</p><p>Madden NFL 26 launches for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14. You can gain access to the game early on August 11 if you buy the $100 Deluxe Edition. On PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, a $150 MVP Bundle is available, and it comes with College Football 26 Deluxe Edition.</p>
