                <p dir="ltr">If you rolled credits on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" data-ref-id="1900-6418382">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, chances are you got through it with little frustration and extraneous effort. By many accounts, bosses take seconds to plow through, mining gold is seemingly unlimited, and overall the game is "too easy." But the phrasing is somewhat reductive, not just in relation to Bananza, but when discussing difficulty in games as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The stigma of "too easy" might indicate that a game is hand-holdy, not trusting players to act or think for themselves. Or, it's boring and monotonous, lacking in mechanical complexity and resulting in little satisfaction from overcoming obstacles.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Donkey Kong Bananza GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Loosely characterizing Donkey Kong Bananza in this manner misses the point of what makes the game so enjoyable to play. Bananza is a breeze for players because it's built on a framework that is versatile and complex yet accessible and intuitive. By giving you all the tools you need to succeed in Bananza's vast sandbox, Nintendo made a game that feels effortless to punch your way through. If you think the game is easy, then it's doing its job correctly--Nintendo wants it to feel easy.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming that Donkey Kong Bananza isn't your first-ever video game, you're probably already well-versed and literate in gaming. With Bananza, Nintendo created a gaming "language" that players could pick up with little trouble. As you progress through the game, you learn how to string together basic control functions to execute creative movements. It's not unlike how Mario could use Cappy for platforming in Super Mario Odyssey, but DK has a lot more in his toolset.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560185"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560185-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_07.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong Bananza is a game that requires creative solutions, and it prepares and trains the player well enough in this gameplay language so that these solutions come quickly. Often, Bananza has the answer to a problem right in front of the player, but the game doesn't give it away with a giant arrow (even though there are Fractones literally shaped like giant arrows that will direct you at critical story moments). Instead, the player must recall all of the challenges they've faced and the different contexts and cases in which they used the game's toolset to conjure up a solution.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Bananza often reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (and its sequel) in that problems can have multiple solutions, some that feel unintentional. The knowledge of the game's physics and how different materials interact with each other is lodged in your brain, and both Bananza and Breath of the Wild give you space to play around and solve puzzles in the way you want to. The shrines in Zelda and challenge rooms in Bananza are the best examples of these, acting as quizzes on how much knowledge about the games' systems you have retained and how to use them in different scenarios.</p><p dir="ltr">The open-world Zelda games and Bananza offer so many abilities and moves that forging your own path toward a solution almost feels like cheating. Think of every time where it felt like Bananza wanted you to take a certain route for a Banandium Gem, only for you to smash your own shortcut to it; or times when you should have gone through a platforming section, only to bypass most of it by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-transformations-in-donkey-kong-bananza-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6727/" data-ref-id="2900-6727">gliding as an ostrich</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn't mean the game is broken--you're just smart enough to take that approach. And with the amount of testing that any video game goes through, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-19-donkey-kong-bananza-part-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo undoubtedly knew that you could do that</a>, but Bananza is designed to make it feel like it was entirely your original idea.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560186"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560186-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All this said, arguing against the simple labeling of "too easy" isn't to excuse Donkey Kong Bananza for any flaws or to shield it from all criticism. The boss fights are unmemorable encounters that negatively impact the game's pacing, and the abundance of gold essentially breaks the game's economy. There are imbalances in Bananza that warrant discussion. But condemning the game as "too easy" distracts us from the triumph and empowerment that we should feel as players.</p><p dir="ltr">It's probably silly to compare Donkey Kong Bananza to Dark Souls or Elden Ring, games that some players might find to be "too hard." The Souls games from From Software and Hidetaka Miyazaki wear their difficulty on their sleeve. Even still, Nintendo and From Software have the same goal with their respective titles: making the player feel powerful.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170114122457/http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/11/05/feature-demon-s-souls-director-discusses-difficulty-sequels-and-more.aspx" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Describing Demon's Souls back in 2009</a>, Miyazaki told Game Informer that making the game "difficult" was never the goal of the developers; instead, From Software wanted players to feel an "intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things." The Souls games approach this very differently from Nintendo titles--Souls games are famously unforgiving--but what they have in common is that they both provide players with tools to feel that sense of accomplishment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2880" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4560187"></a><figcaption>Donkey Kong Bananza</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4560187-ns2_donkeykongbananza_scrn_01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While something like Dark Souls might obviously be less approachable and more complex than Donkey Kong Bananza, it is still very much a game designed to be completed. Video games should make you feel successful, powerful, and smart, and the way Nintendo designed Bananza does just that.</p><p dir="ltr">Plus, like most modern Nintendo platformers, anyone seeking a higher level of challenge in Bananza can look forward to the post-game content. If you haven't played any of the Bananza Rehearsal levels, be warned that they can be infuriating. If you feel that the base game is missing some tension, those levels might provide it--and accomplishing them feels pretty darn good, or at least relieving.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll probably never abandon the vocabulary of "easy" and "hard" to describe games. Those words are, well, too easy to use in discussions. Still, with everything these games accomplish in empowering players, we should be able to critically discuss what makes a game feel easy or hard, rather than dismissing the entire experience with a single adjective.</p><p dir="ltr">I understand why someone playing Donkey Kong Bananza might call it too easy--but not only should we give developers the credit for crafting an approachable experience, we should acknowledge that we're pretty good at playing video games.</p>

                <p>It's the end of the road for two 2K Sports titles, at least for their online services. The publisher has announced that the servers for two aging golf games--The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour and PGA Tour 2K21--will go offline on October 30, 2025.</p><p>As of August 30, however, 2K Sports removed the ability to purchase any virtual currency for either game. Beyond that, however, the publisher said players "won't see any effect."</p><p>On October 30, 2K will close the servers for both titles, meaning each game's store, along with all online game modes and functionality--including progression rewards--will no longer be available.</p><p>2K Sports informed players of these changes in an email.</p><p>The publisher did not provide a reason for why the servers are going offline, but it's not uncommon for online servers for older games to close down over time. The games feature official PGA Tour licensed content, so expiring contracts could be a factor as well.</p><p>Released in 2018, The Golf Club 2019 featuring PGA Tour was the first game in the series to feature the PGA Tour branding. There was no entry in the series in 2019, but the franchise came back in 2020 as PGA Tour 2K21. PGA Tour 2K23 was released in 2022, followed by PGA Tour 2K25 in 2025.</p><p>PGA Tour 2K25 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 16 best-selling game for 2025 so far</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">There could be new content added to the Final Fantasy Tactics remake--and even a full-fledged sequel somewhere down the line--but that will require fans putting money where their mouths are with Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles. However, that's not a guarantee. </p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a>, game director Kazutoyo Maehiro discussed possibly adding features from 2007's Final Fantasy Chronicles: War of the Lions release on PlayStation Portable to the remake. “Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” said Maehiro. He acknowledged fan feedback for that content, such as the Onion Knight and Black Knight classes, but "cannot make any promises" about them coming eventually to The Ivalice Chronicles.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The remake will introduce a new difficulty option called Squire, which is aimed at helping newcomers to the spinoff series and genre. In addition, The Ivalice Chronicles does utilize the script from War of the Lions for the classic version included with the remake. As for a proper sequel to Final Fantasy Tactics, that will depend on the game's reception and sales.</p><p dir="ltr">"If [The Ivalice Chronicles] were to become a success, I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs," said Maehiro, who served as events planner for the original Final Fantasy Tactics in 1997. Earlier this year, the original's art director talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ff-tactics-original-art-director-wanted-to-make-it-under-one-unusual-condition/1100-6532552/">becoming obsessed with Final Fantasy Tactics running at 60fps</a> on PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/">The Final Fantasy Tactics remake was announced</a> at the PlayStation State of Play event in June. The RPG is set to launch September 30 on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2. In fact, there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chonicles-preorder-amazon-exclusive-edition-switch-2-playstation/1100-6532119/">a free Switch 2 upgrade for The Ivalice Chronicles</a>, though no physical edition for the new hybrid console.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

In 2021, it was announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-being-co-developed-by-tomb-raider-dev-crystal-dynamics/1100-6496517/" data-ref-id="1100-6496517">Crystal Dynamics would step in</a> to help as the game's co-developer.

Among them were those who worked at The Initiative, which was shuttered as a result of the layoffs.
