                <p>Worlds will collide in the newly announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-2-stay-human/" data-ref-id="5000-483358">Dying Light 2</a> x <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a> crossover event, but Jimbo the clown looks right at home in the former. In fact, Jimbo seems positively giddy about the prospect of some zombie-killing mayhem in the announcement video for the Friend of Aiden Bundle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpu29Y7m2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gpu29Y7m2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is a free bundle, and Dying Light 2 developer Techland has indicated that it can be unlocked by finding "the mysterious posters in the Bazaar and the Fish Eye." From there, players will have to solve riddles that "will test your knowledge of Villedor." This adds two new quests to the game. Once those are completed, the following items can be yours:</p><ul><li>Jimboâ€™s Outfit--No clowning around with this outfit on, you've got a job to do: kill some zombies!</li><li>Ceremonial Dagger--It's no longer just a Joker. Grab the dagger and show 'em you're not bluffing! Increase your multiplier by defeating different types of enemies, performing finishers and destroying Joker Charms. <strong>Note:</strong> the multiplier is reset when the weapon is repaired, so get all you can out of it!</li><li>Joker Charm--Which Joker will you get? Who knows! Create a charm, and you'll receive a random one with a unique gameplay effect. Just like in Balatro, some will be more useful than others.</li><li>Flying Blind Paraglider--You might miss out on a few chips, but every poker player has to have an exit plan when the odds aren't looking good.</li></ul><p>This isn't the first collaboration for Balatro, which has had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">previous crossovers</a> with Dead by Daylight, Civilization VII, Critical Role, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, Slay the Princess, and Rust. Balatro developer LocalThunk admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-creator-only-just-recently-100-completed-his-own-game/1100-6532649/" data-ref-id="1100-6532649">he only recently 100% completed his own game</a>. Actor Jack Black has also come forward and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-really-needs-your-balatro-tips/1100-6530586/" data-ref-id="1100-6530586">asked players to send him their Balatro tips</a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-hits-big-sales-milestone-after-being-showered-with-awards/1100-6528912/" data-ref-id="1100-6528912">Balatro passed 5 million in sales</a> across all platforms.</p><p>As for Dying Light, Techland has the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, slated to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 22. Techland has also confirmed that there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-dying-light-switch-2-port-dev-confirms/1100-6532747/" data-ref-id="1100-6532747">no plans to bring Dying Light 2 to Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rematch-review-unbelievable-tekkers/1900-6418378/" data-ref-id="1900-6418378">Rematch</a> has caught fire this month, bringing in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-a-soccer-game-from-the-developers-of-sifu-is-off-to-a-hot-start/1100-6532582/" data-ref-id="1100-6532582">millions of players </a>since its release. Now, developer Sloclap is teaming up with Puma, one of the leading companies in footwear and sports apparel, to bring players some new gear options in this wildly popular soccer game.</p><p>The official teaser video for this collaboration only shows a few of Rematch's new items, including a Puma shirt, shoes, and shin guards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4gVa8v1ok" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DP4gVa8v1ok" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Apparently this is the only Puma-exclusive outfit currently in Rematch, but the announcement indicates that more Puma clothing options will be added over time. Sloclap also notes that "the in-game Rematch outfit consists of popular in-real-life collections mixed and matched to create a stylish outfit that lets you look as good as you play."</p><p>Over 1 million players sampled Rematch on its first day alone, including gamers who subscribe to Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass Ultimate</a>. The game depicts a potential future for soccer that's set four decades down the line. Instead of fielding a full team, there are arcade-style 5v5 matchups, with options for 3v3 and 4v4 battles as well. There have also been several tweaks to the game, including the removal of fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, draws, and shoot-outs. Even the ball is always in play because the entire game takes place inside a cage.</p><p>Although Rematch is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-wont-have-cross-play-options-ready-in-time-for-launch/1100-6532448/" data-ref-id="1100-6532448">there aren't currently any options for cross-play</a>. Sloclap still intends to add that feature at a later date. Rematch players have recently discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-players-discover-jumping-is-faster-than-running-but-dev-is-fixing-that-soon/1100-6532753/" data-ref-id="1100-6532753">jumping is faster than running</a> in this game, but Sloclap is already planning a fix for that.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is expanding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s slim GameCube library with another classic next week. The beloved arcade soccer game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-strikers/" data-ref-id="5000-24383">Super Mario Strikers</a> will join the lineup on July 3.</p><p>Originally released in 2005, Super Mario Strikers is a fast-paced soccer game starring an assortment of iconic Mario characters. Like other Mario sports titles, the game features numerous arcade elements, including items like banana peels that can be used to trip up your opponent, as well as powerful special shots that are worth two goals if successfully executed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VOcz6Z5PRY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Super Mario Strikers would go on to spawn two sequels. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-charged/" data-ref-id="5000-28061">Mario Strikers Charged</a> launched for the Wii in 2007, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-battle-league/" data-ref-id="5000-557731">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> was released on the Switch back in 2022.</p><p>With the addition of Super Mario Strikers, Switch Online's GameCube library spans four games so far. Nintendo has already confirmed that more classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-sunshine/" data-ref-id="5000-3885">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-colosseum/" data-ref-id="5000-18350">Pokemon Colosseum</a> are coming to the service in the future.</p><p>The GameCube library is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan. In addition, subscribers can download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free, although it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-upgrade-process-is-mildly-confusing-for-nso-members/1100-6532137/" data-ref-id="1100-6532137">may not be immediately clear how</a>.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Another perk of the Switch Online service is Switch 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">GameChat</a> function, which allows users to chat and share their screen with friends. The feature is free to try for all Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026 as part of an open-access trial period, after which point you'll need to have a Switch Online subscription to use it.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/" data-ref-id="5000-634330">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>, also known as Resident Evil 9, stars Grace Ashcroft, the presumed daughter of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-outbreak/" data-ref-id="5000-4247">Resident Evil: Outbreak</a>'s Alyssa Ashcroft. The decision to cast a new character in the lead role isn't unheard of for Resident Evil--the last two games have starred Ethan Winters, who was also new at the time. However, fans of the series might've expected a familiar face, such as Leon S. Kennedy, to reappear as the playable character. During the Capcom Showcase for June 2025, the developer-publisher explained why Leon, specifically, isn't a good fit for Requiem.</p><p>"We always thought about making Leon the protagonist," <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLYYnkbg-F_/?igsh=bjNyazdqd280c29p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a developer said during the showcase</a>, "but making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn't jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing. So he's actually quite a bad match for horror." Grace, meanwhile, is said to be an FBI analyst who is trained with guns but must learn to overcome some of her fears over the course of the game's story, as she's initially "introverted and easily scared."</p><p>Leon has previously starred in three mainline Resident Evil entries: Resident Evil 2, alongside Claire Redfield, Resident Evil 4--often lauded as the series' best entry--and Resident Evil 6 as one of multiple playable characters. He's appeared in several other offshoots throughout Resident Evil's history, too, such as ReVerse and Operation Raccoon City, and is widely regarded as one of the most prominent figures in the franchise.</p><p>It's unclear what role, if any, Leon may play in Resident Evil: Requiem, though Capcom tends to thrust its famous faces into its stories even when they aren't the protagonist or playable character. Chris Redfield, for example, plays an important role in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-village/" data-ref-id="5000-513797">Resident Evil: Village</a>.</p><p>If only Leon weren't so hunky and valiant, he may appear once more as the central figure in one of Capcom's more horror-centric entries like next February's Requiem.</p>

                <p>Monster Hunter Wilds next free content update is adding two new monsters, Lagiacrus and Seregios, along with underwater combat and layered weapons.</p><p>Announced during the Capcom Spotlight showcase, Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 2 arrives on June 30, and it is adding a ton of new content to the game. The biggest new additions here are the two monsters, both of which are returning favorites from previous games. Lagiacrus is a sea wyvern, preferring a water habitat. While Capcom's trailer depicted it fighting on land, it also included underwater combat sections, as well. Meanwhile, Seregios is a medium-sized wyvern with bright gold scales. Both of those monsters will be available on June 30.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522242"></a><figcaption>The new monsters will be available on June 30, with other features rolling out later.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4522242-mhroadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Capcom also ran down the schedule of new content coming to Monster Hunter Wilds throughout the summer. On June 30, the next wave of cosmetic DLC will arrive, adding new layered armor and emotes. Late July will see the release of the next tempered monster, Arch Temper Uth Duna. Festival of Accord: Flamefete, a summer-themed event with new cosmetics and event quests, runs from July 23 to August 6. On August 27, Capcom is releasing a new emote in collaboration with Fender guitars. Capcom concluded by revealing that Title Update 3, which will add another monster, will arrive in late September.</p><p>The update also adds a number of small quality-of-life features, like layered weapons and improved photo mode options, like new lighting options.
