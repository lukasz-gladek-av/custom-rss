                <p>After adding two-player expeditions in the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, From Software's latest patch is adding some balance adjustments to the powerful abilities that come with the legendary sword known as Storm Ruler.</p><p>Going forward, it won't take as long to charge the storm effect and the animation speed of the blade will be faster. Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations. Performance issues appear to have been the main problems addressed in the patch, but there were others as well, including a bug that prevented some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign Caligo, Miasma of Night from hitting other players.</p><p>There was also one bug fix that specific to PlayStation 5, where both the user interface and the heads-up display might disappear for players. That bug might be followed by the game crashing altogether if players attempted to continue playing.</p><p>What's coming next for Nightreign after this patch? A recent datamine suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/" data-ref-id="1100-6533778">a ranked mode may be debuting on Nightreign</a> in the future. Last month, Bandai Namco and From Software announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">Nightreign has shipped 5 million copies</a> since its debut at the end of May.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-confirmed-for-switch-2/1100-6530541/" data-ref-id="1100-6530541">Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year, which will include the base game and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion.

                <p dir="ltr">Some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> players charge into battle swinging broadswords, others rain arrows from afar, and then some prefer to watch the world burn from a safe distance. If your idea of fun involves turning mana into spectacular destruction, Terraria’s magic weapons are your bread and butter. From humble sparks to kaleidoscopic death rays, these staves of sorcery are the ultimate tools for mages looking to leave a scorching impression.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic wands in Terraria are more than just damage sticks. The best ones combine range, style, and special effects that can turn tricky boss fights into theatrical light shows. Our picks cover every stage of the game, from your first foray into the forests to the celestial gauntlet at the very end. Whether you’re into precise spellwork or screen-filling chaos, here’s what you should have in your arsenal.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Wand_of_Sparking">Wand of Sparking</a></li><li><a href="#Magic_Missile">Magic Missile</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Scythe">Demon Scythe</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Crystal_Storm">Crystal Storm</a></li><li><a href="#Betsy___s_Wrath">Betsy’s Wrath</a></li><li><a href="#Last_Prism">Last Prism</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Abracadabra">Abracadabra</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549327"></a><figcaption>Terraria's Wand of Sparking in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Wand_of_Sparking">Wand of Sparking</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 0</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 14%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 26 (Average)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you’re fresh out of character creation and still rocking copper tools, the Wand of Sparking is your first taste of arcane power. It’s not subtle, shooting tiny flames with modest damage, but it’s notably accessible. You can find it in surface chests or wooden crates from fishing, meaning there’s a decent chance you’ll be clearing out caves and singeing zombies before you’ve even built a proper house.</p><p dir="ltr">It has the lowest mana cost in the game at just two per shot, letting you spam fire bolts without worrying too much about blue star supplies. Equip early mana-boosting accessories like the Magic Cuffs for a touch more staying power, and it’ll carry you comfortably until stronger dungeon loot appears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328"></a><figcaption>Magic Missile floats towards its target</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Missile">Magic Missile</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 22 (Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Looted from Dungeon chests after defeating Skeletron, the Magic Missile feels like an upgrade in both power and control. You guide its projectile with your cursor until you release it or it hits an obstacle, letting you strike around corners or through gaps. The explosion on impact is perfect for clearing out enemies huddled behind cover.</p><p dir="ltr">The only catch is the moderate mana cost, but by the time you find one, you should have a healthy pool to work with. Pair it with the Jungle Armour set for early magic bonuses, and you’ll have a spell that can comfortably handle most pre-Hardmode bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329"></a><figcaption>Demon Scythe shoots Demon Sickles at a Herpling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Demon_Scythe">Demon Scythe</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost:14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Demons in the Underworld, the Demon Scythe is a deceptively strong choice for players with good aim. It summons scythe projectiles that deal very high damage and can pierce multiple enemies at once. The initial slow travel speed makes it less ideal for fast-moving targets, but it’s a blessing against the flailing limbs of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> like Skeletron and Wall of Flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming this means braving the lava-filled Underworld, so bring Obsidian Skin Potions and a ranged backup weapon in case those Demons get too close. At this point, you’ll be ready to transition to Hardmode, as the Demon Scythe is one of the few early magic weapons that keeps pace with the rising stakes, including faster enemies with higher health pools.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330"></a><figcaption>Crystal Storm ricochets off Temple walls</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crystal_Storm">Crystal Storm</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 32</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 7 (Extremely fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Crafted from 20 Crystal Shards, 15 Souls of Light, and a Spell Tome using a Bookcase, the Crystal Storm turns you into a walking bullet hell machine. Its rapid-fire projectiles ricochet off walls, chewing through enemies in tight arenas, which is particularly ideal for crowd control in events and invasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The low individual mana cost is deceptive, as each shot rapidly drains your reserves. You’ll need the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories for magic</a> in early Hardmode and potions to sustain fire for long stretches. Pair it with the Mana Flower or Celestial Cuffs, and you’ll fend off the Pirate Invasion like few other weapons can at this stage of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331"></a><figcaption>Betsy's Wrath rains down in threes</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Betsy___s_Wrath">Betsy’s Wrath</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Betsy in the Old One’s Army event, which only occurs after you’ve defeated the Golem, Betsy’s Wrath is a versatile magic weapon. Firing a trio of fireballs, the magic weapon not only covers a wider area than most alternatives, but it also inflicts the Betsy’s Curse debuff, which substantially reduces your enemy’s defence.</p><p dir="ltr">As you navigate the third act, Betsy’s Wrath is a perfect choice for boss fights and multiplayer scenarios, boosting overall team damage. Its fast firing rate and good range make it a flexible all-rounder in Hardmode. Just make sure you have the space, as low ceilings hinder the weapon’s effectiveness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332"></a><figcaption>Converged Last Prism fires a singular beam</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Last_Prism">Last Prism</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 0.25</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 10 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by the Moon Lord, the Last Prism is Terraria’s ultimate magic weapon, firing a rainbow beam that converges into pure, boss-melting energy. It’s absurdly mana-hungry, draining reserves in seconds, but with Nebula Armour, Celestial Cuffs, and Mana Regeneration Potions, you can keep it firing long enough to erase even the game’s toughest foes.</p><p dir="ltr">For sustained output, tap-fire to conserve mana between bursts; for sheer spectacle, hold it down and watch the world disappear in light. Nothing else comes close to its mix of style and raw, unstoppable power, giving you the victory lap you truly deserve.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Abracadabra">Abracadabra</h2><p dir="ltr">Magic wands offer a unique flavour of combat compared to other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a>, trading brute force for precision, style, and sometimes outright spectacle. Whether you’re igniting slimes in the forest, painting laser trails across the sky, or collapsing bosses under a prism of doom, there’s a spell to match your mood and progression.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep your mana high, your gear in top form, and your spellbook stocked because when the next boss arrives, you’ll want more than just firepower. You’ll want a little magic.</p>

                <p>The storytellers behind Blizzard's Story and Franchise Development team have decided to unionize. Following the results of a union-authorization vote, Blizzard's SFD will now join the Communications Workers of America in Orange County, California. Additionally, Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the SFD team's union vote.</p><p>There have been two previous unionization votes at Blizzard in the past year. In July 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">the developers behind World of Warcraft voted to unionize</a> and joined CWA. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">Overwatch 2 team passed a similar vote in May 2025</a>, and also joined CWA.</p><p>One of the SFD union organizers, Buddy Fisk, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzards-story-and-franchise-development-workers-form-latest-video-game-union" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared a statement through CWA</a> citing the increasingly frequent layoffs in the video game industry as a driving force behind this vote.</p><p>"After more than a decade working at Blizzard, I've seen all the highs and lows," said Fisk. "For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading. With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone."</p><p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a> last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-rumble-will-receive-no-new-content-amidst-layoffs-at-blizzard/1100-6532929/" data-ref-id="1100-6532929">Blizzard lost many members of the team dedicated</a> to the mobile game Warcraft Rumble. Across Microsoft as a whole, approximately 9,000 jobs were lost.</p><p>Earlier this month, Diablo general manager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Rod Fergusson announced his departure from Blizzard</a> after spending half a decade with the company. Blizzard has also signaled some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-making-big-changes-to-how-it-talks-to-the-diablo-4-community/1100-6533773/" data-ref-id="1100-6533773">changes to the way it interacts with Diablo 4 fans in Campfire Chats</a>. Additionally, Blizzard president Johanna Faries hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/" data-ref-id="1100-6530062">more TV and movies based on the studio's franchises</a> may eventually be made.</p>
