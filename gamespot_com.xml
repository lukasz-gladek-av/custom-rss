                <p>This September will be the 30th anniversary of Doom's arrival on the Super Nintendo. But Limited Run isn't waiting around to get the party started. The physical-media brand has debuted the first look at the Doom SNES collector's edition, as well as the special rumble controller that will be compatible with it.</p><p>On Friday, July 11, preorders will open for <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/doom-collectors-edition-snes?_pos=2&amp;_sid=d74ea325e&amp;_ss=r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Doom collector's edition</a> and <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/doom-snes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Doom standard edition</a>, which will go for $175 and $100, respectively. Both versions include 14 new levels that weren't on the original SNES release, as well as nightmare mode, circle strafing, performance enhancements, and rumble support on playable SNES cartridges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528449" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528449"></a><figcaption>Doom collector's edition (SNES).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4528449-doomsneslimitedrunpreorder.jpg"></figure><p>The collector's edition features a blood-splattered cartridge, an embossed foil box, a 12" x 16" poster, and an instruction booklet. However, it does not include a controller. If you want to try out <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-merch/products/snes-rumble-controller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the new SNES rumble controller</a>, then you'll have to order that separately for $35.

But once the controller is released, it's possible that more titles could be added in the future. 8BitDo also has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Wireless-Gamepad-Original-Transparent-nintendo/dp/B092DXQYDK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;th=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a wireless SNES controller on Amazon</a>, but it doesn't have the rumble feature.</p><p>The preorder period for Doom SNES and the SNES rumble controller will run through August 10, with an estimated delivery in February 2026.</p><p>Before that arrives, the most-recent game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, is getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/go-behind-the-scenes-of-doom-the-dark-ages-with-this-new-art-book/1100-6532901/" data-ref-id="1100-6532901">an art book in November</a> from Dark Horse Books.</p>
