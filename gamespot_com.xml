                <p><a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/12/ftc-sends-refund-payments-consumers-impacted-epic-games-unlawful-billing-practices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The first round of refund payments</a> have arrived in the hands of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players who the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) says "were tricked by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite, into making unwanted purchases." Payments have been sent to folks who filed a claim before the original February 2024 deadline--but don't worry, there's still more time to get in on this settlement if you missed out previously.</p><p>At issue, according to the FTC, was "Fortnite's counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration [which] led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button." This refers to how the item shop used to allow players to make a purchase with a single, instant button push, and there was only a very brief window within which it was possible to cancel the purchase. The additions of the "hold-to-purchase" interaction in the shop, as well as the 24-hour window to cancel a purchase, were the result of this and similar suits in Europe.</p><p>As part of the claims process, users could choose to be paid via check or PayPal. Those who chose PayPal and have an approved claim--which the FTC  said makes up about half of the 629,344 payments in this round--should have received the money in their accounts on Monday. Those who opted for a check will receive it later.</p><p>This round of payments totaled about $72 million, which means users received a little over $100 on average, though the totals varied based on how much each person had spent during the window of time that this settlement applied to, with players receiving $250-300 on the high end.</p><p>For those who haven't filed a claim but want to get in on these refunds, it's still possible to do so--this first round of payments is only a third of the total Epic is supposed to pay, and the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FTC is still taking claims on its website here</a>. Just keep in mind this is only for folks who played Fortnite prior to September 2022, so newer players need not apply.</p>

                <p>Despite releasing into early access, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> is filled to the brim with content. From the main story campaign to side bosses to an endless endgame, you're certainly getting your money's worth by participating in early access. Some players could find hundreds of hours of gameplay in Path of Exile 2 just through the game's initial content.</p><p>However, if you're trying to gauge exactly how much time you have to spend in Path of Exile 2 before "beating it," that's another story. Below, you can find how long it takes to beat Path of Exile 2, how long it takes to reach the endgame, and a full quest list so you can track your progress.</p><h2>How long to beat Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Since Path of Exile 2 is an ARPG, you can never truly "beat it." Most ARPGs follow a similar structure of progressing through a main campaign that's followed by the endgame. The endgame is what you make of it and you could spend however much time you want with a given character participating in endgame content.</p><p>With that in mind, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/" data-ref-id="2900-5988">beating Path of Exile 2</a> can be defined as simply reaching the endgame and getting past all the campaign acts. In early access, there are three acts you need to progress through before reaching the endgame. This number of acts will eventually be doubled to six in the full release of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412761"></a><figcaption>Act 2 features a completely new zone and quests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412761-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.41.48.80.png"></figure><p>However, just beating the three acts doesn't get you to the endgame. Instead, you need to first beat the three acts on standard difficulty, which gets you to level 45. Then, you're required to beat Acts 1-3 again on Cruel difficulty to finally reach the endgame. Doing all of this should result in your character being around level 65.</p><p>Your first time <strong>beating the three acts should take 25 or so hours</strong> in Path of Exile 2. Then, you'll need another 15-20 hours to get past the acts again on Cruel difficulty. This puts the time to reach the endgame anywhere from 40-50 hours per character.</p><p>If you want to play as another class in Path of Exile 2, you'll have to repeat the same process over again. This means another 40-50 hours to reach the endgame with that character.</p><p>Once you reach the endgame in Path of Exile 2, the world is your oyster. You have the freedom to spend any additional amount of time with any character as you progress through endgame content. The maximum level cap in Path of Exile 2 early access is level 100, though, so it might not be worth it to try and go past that level just yet.</p><h2>Path of Exile 2 full quest list</h2><p>One of the best ways to track your progress during the main story is by checking what quest you're on. If you know the names and order of the quests in each act, you can accurately gauge how far away you are from the next act.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4412762"></a><figcaption>A full quest list for Act 1.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4412762-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.09-17.42.18.16.png"></figure><p>Below, you'll find the full three-act main quest list in Path of Exile 2:</p><p><strong>Act 1</strong></p><ul><li>Reaching Clearfell  <ul><li>Mercy for the Miller</li></ul></li><li>Secrets in the Dark</li><li>The Mysterious Shade</li><li>Sorrow Among Stones</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>The Mad Wolf of Ogham</li></ul><p><strong>Act 2</strong></p><ul><li>Earning Passage</li><li>The Trail of Corruption</li><li>A Theft of Ivory</li><li>The City of Seven Waters</li><li>A Crown of Stone</li></ul><p><strong>Act 3</strong></p><ul><li>Legacy of the Vaal</li><li>The Vaal Jungle</li><li>Mysteries of the Vaal</li></ul><p>There are more quests in Act 3, but that's all players have seen up to this point.
