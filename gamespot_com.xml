                <p>Earlier this year, Krafton released the life-sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">InZoi</a> in early access with the promise of free DLC throughout the year. Now, details about the second DLC have been revealed, and it's coming later this month alongside InZoi's debut on Mac.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoD3q-qOVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uoD3q-qOVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new DLC is called Island Getaway, and it was inspired by the tropical locations in Southeast Asia. It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>

                <p>Thirteen years after it first appeared in The Sims 3, singer Katy Perry surprised fans when she reprised her hit song "Last Friday Night" at a concert this week--and sang in Simlish, the nonsense language of Sims characters.</p><p>On X, TheWitnessedBoy shared a clip from a TikTok user of Perry from a recent concert (via<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-simlish-sims-3-concert-last-friday-night-video-2000616677" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a>), in which the singer accepted a fan's request to sing Last Friday Night in Simlish. Rather than sing the entire song in Simlish, Perry opted to start with the chorus. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry‚Äôs tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p>  ‚Äî Fadi ¬π‚Å¥¬≥ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Perry was a prominent promotional partner of Electronic Arts in marketing The Sims 3 in 2012, with the game's Showtime expansion pack even having a Katy Perry Collector's Edition.

But don't hold your breath for The Sims 5.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is secretly the most popular game around. This May, the Roblox game "Grow a Garden" surpassed seven million concurrent users--but Roblox itself has been hugely popular, especially with kids, for years. Case in point: YouTube revealed today that Roblox-related videos have surpassed 1 <em>trillion</em> views. Trillion.</p><p>To celebrate the momentous number, YouTube has launched a Roblox Museum within Roblox, which the company describes as "a virtual space where anyone can go to visit over 100 special relics, each representing a key creator moment from over the years." YouTube and Roblox debuted within a year of each other, YouTube notes, and so Roblox videos have been a part of YouTube for almost its entire lifetime. If you don't play Roblox but want to check out the museum, YouTube released a preview hosted by Roblox content creators Lanaslifeee and MeEnyu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2Kfm-knAc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q2Kfm-knAc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those who want to check out the museum for themselves, you can also hop directly to the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/87445296052708/YouTubes-Roblox-Museum" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">museum's landing page</a> on Roblox. The museum also features a scavenger hunt that will reward you with an exclusive in-game item.</p><p>Roblox is the second game to reach the trillion-view milestone. Just short of three years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> reached a trillion views, and released a video to celebrate at the time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWaWS7mVac" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ISWaWS7mVac" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This comes at an interesting moment for the game. A quick scroll through the comments reveals that players aren't terribly interested in the video itself, and are instead much more focused on the age verification requirements coming to the game, which involve allowing an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-new-age-verification-feature-uses-ai-to-scan-teens-video-selfies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI to scan a video selfie</a> before players will be allowed to fully access Roblox's soon-to-be tiered communication system.</p>

Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA promised the plagiarized art would be removed and replaced, and thanks to an update today, these cards now feature the official artwork.</p><p>When Wisdom of Sea and Sky first launched on July 30, an artist by the name of Lanjiujiu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">came forward with a comparison</a> of their own art of Ho-Oh and the version that was seemingly traced over for the expansion's cards.</p><p>The developers immediately released a statement about the incident, claiming that "the card production team provided incorrect reference material as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p><p>Due to these issues, Pok√©mon TCG Pocket was forced to pull the art from both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX, the latter of which featured the plagiarized Ho-Oh artwork. That meant that for the next week players who cracked packs and received these legendary cards were greeted by an admittedly hilarious sight: a completely plain card that simply featured text saying that new artwork would be coming soon.</p><p>Now though, both Pok√©mon cards boast entirely new art, and players who already pulled them should now have the updated assets. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spotted that the new replacement designs are credited to the same artist, Sie Nanahara, who also made the now-pulled art that these cards first launched with. In response to Pocket's plagiarized assets, as well as their swift removal, Lanjiujiu shared, "I appreciate the prompt resolution and hope this matter rests here."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 on PC requires Secure Boot, something meant to help ward off cheaters. For many, this is already enabled and thus a non-issue as they attempt to play the beta. For others, it may mean taking a trip into BIOS menus they're unaccustomed to seeing but ultimately something that can be resolved in a matter of minutes. For others still, the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enabling-secure-boot-for-battlefield-6-is-turning-into-a-nightmare-for-some/1100-6533811/" data-ref-id="1100-6533811">enabling Secure Boot</a> is turning out to be a much bigger problem.</p><p dir="ltr">Secure Boot is often enabled by default on newer PCs, but that's not always the case. Many people may have never even heard of it before, but with a great deal of interest in the newly launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 beta</a>, many people are hearing the term for the first time--and perhaps having to figure out what acronyms like BIOS and UEFI refer to, and how to deal with the possibility that the drive Windows is installed on uses MBR instead of GPT.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Depending on your specific motherboard, the specific steps for turning Secure Boot on can be different, but it involves restarting your computer, accessing a menu before Windows begins to boot up, and making some tweaks. However, messing around with your BIOS can go awry, and indeed, some players have found they now simply boot into a black screen, temporarily preventing them from using their computer entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">A number of accounts like this have been shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1miaynl/comment/n76dv60/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and anecdotally, GameSpot staff have heard directly from friends encountering just these sort of issues. The ultimate solution can involve having to remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard, flashing it, and relying on the board's integrated HDMI output, rather than a video card, in order to even get back into the BIOS menus.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unlikely EA plans to make changes to the Secure Boot requirement, even if it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-apparently-already-dealing-with-cheaters/1100-6533808/" data-ref-id="1100-6533808">doesn't seem to be entirely keeping cheaters at bay</a>. That could mean an even wider swath of players encounter Secure Boot players as the open beta expands to more players this weekend and the full version of Battlefield 6 launches in October. Activision has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-new-security-measures-adding-secure-boot-requirement/1100-6533739/" data-ref-id="1100-6533739">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require Secure Boot</a>, and it's unlikely to be the last game to call for it. If you like playing multiplayer games on PC, you may just have to hope Secure Boot is already enabled or that you're among those fortunate enough to not encounter any problems in turning it on.</p>

                <p>Back in 2015, Techland partnered with Ampisound--a popular YouTube channel that‚Äôs known for its parkour-based content--to create a video promoting Dying Light. The idea was to showcase the real-life POV of a runner trying to escape a mob of zombies across various locations in Cambridge, UK. The video was a huge success. So much so, that after 10 years, Ampisound has released another real-life Dying Light video sponsored by Techland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWZxhQIWwU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="22">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVWZxhQIWwU?start=22" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ampisound‚Äôs latest video, named Zombie Escape! Parkour POV Chase, acts as a sequel of sorts, which is fitting considering it's being used to promote the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. As far as we can tell, there isn‚Äôt any indication that this is a direct continuation of what came before. That said, it does feature new runners (who all seem more knowledgeable this time around), a worse-off environment, and a larger number of zombies; some time has clearly passed since the last runner‚Äôs untimely demise.</p><p>It's safe to say that Techland is taking the Dying Light series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">back to its roots</a>. Not only are players getting a more linear experience and the return of Kyle Crane in the upcoming sequel, but there‚Äôs also a return to form, marketing wise. Will Techland‚Äôs efforts be enough to get fans to check out Dying Light: The Beast come September 19? We have a little over a month to find out.</p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, Hideo Kojima released his latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. While Kojima is already working on his next title, fans shouldn't get their hopes up about his new stealth-action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a> arriving anytime soon. According to Kojima himself, most of the work on Physint hasn't exited the earliest stage of development.</p><p>Kojima told <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire </a>that he is "starting to work with the team on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, because that's a new project." He then added that he is "doing Physint all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage."</p><p>Physint was first announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-playstation-state-of-play-ps5-games-announcements-recap-january-2024/2900-5063/" data-ref-id="2900-5063">January 2024 State of Play broadcast</a>, and it was described as using "cutting-edge" technology to create a hybrid game and movie experience. Kojima subsequently revealed that the origin of the game came from players' desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">to revisit the stealth-action-espionage genre</a> that he helped create in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. </p><p>According to Kojima, production on both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">OD and Physint were impacted by the video game actors strike</a> that began in 2024 and ran well into this year. Kojima hasn't set a firm timetable for Physint, but he has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-stealth-action-game-physint-isnt-coming-any-time-soon/1100-6531630/" data-ref-id="1100-6531630">it may be "five or six years" away</a>.</p><p>Konami is releasing a remake of Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater later this month. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">when asked if he would ever play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Kojima laughed and confirmed that he will not.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has filed a new patent application that suggests an interesting new way to play. The <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent</a> filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows a crank-like device built to attach to the side of a game controller, allowing you to <em>crank</em> up the fun. Eh?</p><p>The description of the patent goes into detail about the mouse-operation sensor and how the peripheral could attach to a recessed surface in the controller with a mouse operation sensor, which may suggest it could attach directly onto the Switch or Switch 2 Joy-Cons. Then with the crank attached you could explore the many possibilities of crank-based gameplay, from fishing games to probably a second thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534"></a><figcaption>World Intellectual Property Organization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png"></figure><p>While fairly novel, this wouldn't be the first example of a video game device with a crank. The indie handheld hardware <a href="https://play.date/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Playdate</a> has a crank and developers and homebrew artisans alike have been coming up with various applications for it. And Nintendo did once make a cardboard crank with Nintendo Labo, so the company is no stranger to cranks.</p><p>Keep in mind, of course, that a patent application doesn't mean the product will ever come to market. It simply shows that Nintendo has had the idea, not whether the company has decided it's a viable product with wide enough consumer appeal and software applications to produce. Don't count on buying your Nintendo-brand crank anytime soon, but it is at least a possibility that it will come out in some form. After all, who would've thought they'd make <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alarmo</a>?</p>
