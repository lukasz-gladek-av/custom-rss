                <p dir="ltr">Leaks have been surfacing for months about a potential map for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> called Avalon. While nothing has been confirmed by Activision, players now believe the rumored map can be seen while playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Avalon is a large-scale <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-leaks-reveal-a-controversial-warzone-map-with-caldera-2-0-vibes/1100-6525560/">map that leaked with some controversy</a>, as the design includes islands separated with lots of water, giving Caldera 2.0 vibes. Now, players are discovering that using Black Ops 6's spectator mode lets them see a rendered version of the map.</p><p dir="ltr">Players are loading into private matches on Black Ops 6's Lowtown map and using the game's Codcaster setting, which lets them fly out of bounds and explore areas beyond the playable map. This reveals that Lowtown is part of a much larger Warzone-style map. Pieces of this map include older multiplayer maps from previous Black Ops games, such as Firing Range, WMD, and Hacienda. It also includes a view of the cluster of islands as revealed from the previous leaks of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" rel="nofollow ">reported by CharlieIntel</a>, a fan has even gone to the lengths to create a speculative overhead map with named points-of-interest.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The upcoming Warzone map, which is rumored for Fall 2025, can be seen in Black Ops 6's Theater Mode if you go into spectating. <br>Fans have speculated the different POIs based on the locations. <br>Image: u/Dull-Caterpillar3153 <a href="https://t.co/Vfu4YwPv8A" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Vfu4YwPv8A</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1851249665947185506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">While it is very likely that this is the rumored Avalon map for Warzone, it's uncertain when or if this map will arrive in the game.

                <p>Google is celebrating Halloween with a brand new installment of Magic Cat Academy--marking the third edition of the Doodle. In the past, Momo the cat has taken on <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2016/" rel="nofollow "><u>ghouls in school</u></a> and taken a <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2020/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deep dive</a> to tackle sea monsters. This year, Google pits Momo against ghosts and space creatures as she battles her arch nemesis, Marshmallow the ghost, across the cosmos.</p><p>The rules of the game are simple: Draw the designated lines to defeat ghosts and other monsters across five stages. The lines and their sequence get more difficult as the game progresses, but you can always draw a heart to get more life, you just have to be quick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427" data-ratio="0.56288659793814" data-width="1455" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4392427"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4392427-screenshot%28219%29.png"></figure><p>After every level, there's a small scientific fact about the level of the atmosphere and something that the level focused on like stars or the flying fox bat. Google even included a gallery of concept art ranging from level design to dropped ideas like Momo and Marshmallow becoming a giant mech and teaming up. There's also a photo of the real-life Momo lounging around.</p><p>The game will run through October 31, 11:59 PM ET. You can also learn more about this Doodle, Momo's other adventures, and past Doodles <a href="https://doodles.google/doodle/halloween-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

                <p>Although Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones doesn't seem to have any pets during his globetrotting years, the third film--Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade--established that Indy once had a dog named Indiana that he loved very much. And Indy's love for dogs is one reason why he won't be shooting any enemy canines in Bethesda and MachineGames' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-much-nicer-to-its-dogs-than-wolfenstein" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, MachineGames Creative Director Jens Andersson confirmed that Indy's encounters with dogs owned by the bad guys won't end the same way they did in the developers' Wolfenstein games. Instead, Indy can scare off the dogs by pointing his weapon at them, rather than actually following through on the threat.</p><p>"[Indiana Jones] is a dog person," said Andersson. "This is obviously a little bit different than Wolfenstein as well, where the dog will explode... It's a family-friendly IP in many ways. How do we do that well? Well, these are the kind of things that we do. We have dogs as enemies, but you don't really hurt the dogs. You scare them away."</p><p>That's fortunate for the canines, but less so for Doctor Jones. As noted in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431"> early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, the game favors stealth over all-out action. The enemy dogs may prove to be another challenge for Indy to remain undetected by Nazi soldiers. He may not shoot the dogs, but Indiana Jones has never had a problem <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">punching a Nazi in the face</a>. As part of this game, Indy can also take out Nazis with stealth attacks and improvised weapons.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will hit Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. A PlayStation 5 port will follow in 2025.</p>

It's not a complicated racing game, but with its nuanced driving styles and over 130 vehicles to collect, it's a fun game for the entire family to check out.</p><p>For something less kid-friendly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghostwire-tokyo-review-shibuya-scramble/1900-6417848/" data-ref-id="1900-6417848">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a> is a mix of first-person action, spellcasting, and spooky enemies to pummel. Set in Tokyo after it's overrun by supernatural forces unleashed by a sinister occultist, it's up to you to get to the bottom of this mystery and save the day. If you want to grab Ghostwire: Tokyo on PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-games-epic-games-store/1100-6476419/" data-ref-id="1100-6476419">you can get it for free</a> through the Epic Games Store starting October 31, but you'll only have until November 5 to do so.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4392419-ps-plus-november.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392419" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4392419-ps-plus-november.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392419"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Plus November 2024 games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4392419-ps-plus-november.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, Death Note Killer is a brand-new game that mixes detective work with teamwork. Based on the hit anime series, players have to figure out each other's identities and eliminate the opposition in this battle of wits. The Death Note--a supernatural book that can kill anyone whose name is written in it--is hidden among the players and you'll have to formulate strategies on the fly to emerge triumphant in this high-stakes game.</p><p>If you haven't claimed October's PlayStation Plus free games yet--Doki Doki Literature Club Plus, Dead Space, and WWE 2K24--make sure to do so before next Tuesday.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Eight years after its 2016 launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has finally completed 100% of the game he created.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Barone--who single-handedly crafted every inch of Stardew Valley, from its art to its soundtrack to its code--has completed full start-to-finish playthroughs of his game in the past. But this week, Barone revealed that he's recently completed the game in its entirety by unlocking all of Stardew Valley's 49 Steam achievements--and that the game's 1.6 update now has a concrete release date for console and mobile devices.</p><p>"I had to do it over a couple days because I was on a multiplayer farm," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851128915047387239" rel="nofollow ">told a curious fan</a> on Twitter. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run."</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, player-characters can't just keel over and literally die in Barone's cozy little farming sim (although they can pass out). But Stardew Valley includes several arcade-style mini-games in which the <em>player-character's</em> player-character can, in fact, die. This doesn't have particularly dire consequences… unless you're shooting for the Fector's Challenge achievement. Unlocking this achievement requires players to beat one of the aforementioned arcade mini-games--Journey of the Prairie King, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/smash-tv/">Smash TV</a>-style game found in the Stardrop Saloon--without dying. Journey of the Prairie King consists of <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Journey_of_the_Prairie_King#Levels" rel="nofollow ">three stages, with a total of 10 areas to navigate</a> (plus a boss fight at the end of each stage). The minigame is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/413150/discussions/0/3288067088131225168/">notoriously difficult</a>, and is often the last achievement that Stardew Valley completionists manage to finish.</p><p dir="ltr">"I deliberately worked on Fector's Challenge because it was the only one I didn't have," <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851125512753774643" rel="nofollow ">Barone said</a>, confirming that just like many other Stardew Valley achievement hunters, Fector's Challenge was the final hurdle he had to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev also shared some tips for players who are struggling to master Journey of the Prairie King.</p><p dir="ltr">"You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851149876517912827" rel="nofollow ">explained after a player asked for advice</a>. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun power-up for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack you."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone also shared some helpful info on fighting the Outlaw:</p><p dir="ltr">"He has two moves, one where he moves across the screen and shoots," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851365802521608222" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a>. "For that one, move in the opposite direction as him to avoid his bullets, and then hit him diagonally when he pauses. The other move, he pops out and shoots straight at you. If you position yourself right at the edge of his 'cover,' he won't be able to hit you, but you can hit him."</p><p dir="ltr">But perhaps the most interesting info Barone revealed during his chat with players regarding the achievement had nothing to do with minigames at all. Instead, Barone confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update</a> is hitting consoles very soon.</p><p dir="ltr">How soon, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">"1 week," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851126588253045196" rel="nofollow ">tweeted in reply to a player</a> who had asked if there was any news about the console update.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1.6 update launched for PC last March, and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/">a massive amount of content</a>, including new items and crafting materials, improved NPC dialogue, new pets for players to adopt, a quest about a really big tree, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389"></a><figcaption>The 1.6 update breathes new life into Stardew Valley's numerous NPCs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the initial PC launch introduced a few bugs, and the update itself wasn't yet ready for release on console or mobile. Barone pledged that he would temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">cease all work on Haunted Chocolatier</a> until the Stardew Valley 1.6 update was "settled."</p><p dir="ltr">"I am eager to get back to work on [Haunted Chocolatier]," he said at the time. "But I have to see Stardew 1.6 settled, bug-free and out to all platforms first."</p><p dir="ltr">In September, he provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">an update on the state of Stardew 1.6</a>, acknowledging that the console and mobile ports were taking some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was originally hoping [the PC update and console/mobile updates] would be [releasing] maybe one month apart, max," Barone admitted. "At any rate, I feel bad about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Later that month, Barone quietly made <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow ">a post on the official Stardew Valley website</a> revealing that the update would come to console and mobile devices on November 4, which tracks with Barone's recent statement that the update is just a week away.</p><p dir="ltr">"The console and mobile ports of the 1.6 update will be released on November 4th, 2024," Barone's post reads. "Thank you for your patience. The console and mobile ports will release at version 1.6.9, which will also come to PC around that time."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone's wording makes it sound like 1.6.9 might not release for PC at the exact same time it lands on console and mobile devices. So it's unclear if he means the 1.6.9 update will come to PC a few hours after it hits console and mobile, or if PC players will have to wait a few days or weeks to gain access. Regardless, this is good news for both die-hard Stardew Valley fans and players who are itching to get their hands on Barone's next creation. </p><p>"I'm looking forward to having 1.6 fully released on all platforms," Barone said after announcing the release date. "Then I would like to finish Haunted Chocolatier next. Thank you."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Hands On Preview</p>

<p>Torvenius added, "You know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product." He added that MachineGames may release more details on the game's technical specifics ahead of launch "once we see all the telemetry on performance."</p><p>As usual, developers may not know the final details on technical performance until closer to launch, as optimization efforts continue up to release.</p><p>Torvenius shared this information against the backdrop of ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox. </a></p><p>Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a></p><p>The Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle releases on December 9, and it'll be available at launch on Game Pass, in addition to being available for direct purchase on Xbox and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">PS5 edition of the game is coming in Spring 2025.</a></p><p>In other news, it's been revealed that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">includes a disclaimer that its developer does not condone or endorse Nazi ideologies.</a></p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p>
