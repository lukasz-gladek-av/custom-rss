                <p>PUBG publisher Krafton's Sims-like InZoi is headed to PS5 in 2026. The developer <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced today</a> that InZoi will be released on Sony's console next year, but the company didn't have a specific release date to share, nor did it have information to reveal about an Xbox release.</p><p>The studio said an Xbox release is "under consideration, but not yet confirmed." You can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist the game now on the PlayStation Store.</a></p><p>A life-simulation game, InZoi has players controlling "Zois" as as they shape their lives and personal experiences in the world.</p><p>InZoi was released on PC in March this year for $40 as a Steam Early Access title. The game uses AI-generated content for a variety of purposes, including creating 3D objects from image input.</p><p>The game peaked at more than 87,000 concurrent users on Steam back in March but has since <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2456740/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declined to around 1,000 peak concurrent daily players.</a> InZoi Studios is hoping to see its player numbers jump again when the first DLC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3887680/inZOI__Island_Getaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Island Getaway</a>, launches on August 20. The DLC adds a variety of tropical-themed activities like swimming and snorkeling.</p><p>As for EA's The Sims series, the publisher is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/" data-ref-id="1100-6533647">not making The Sims 5</a> and will instead further flesh out The Sims 4 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-project-rene/">expand in new ways with Project Rene and other endeavors. </a></p>

                <p>The saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> has played out in the court of public opinion this summer, and now it's taken another step towards an actual courtroom. Krafton has officially responded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders</a> Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as former CEO Ted Gill--all three of whom were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>.</p><p>Cleveland and his team have accused Krafton of delaying Subnautica 2 in order to prevent the publisher from paying Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-unknonw-worlds-delay-steam-2000617210" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Krafton's response accuses the co-founders of valuing the $250 million bonus over delivering a more complete version of Subnautica 2. The filing goes even further and states that the co-founders were fired to prevent them "from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds' most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans."</p><p>The $250 million bonus was supposed to be paid out to Unknown Worlds if the company met certain financial goals in 2025, which would be almost impossible if Subnautica 2 doesn't get an early-access release this year. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting those benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of the bonus would have gone to the former leadership team.</p><p>Krafton's complete <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to the lawsuit is online</a>, and it paints a picture of the co-founders attempting to rush Subnautica 2 into early access while simultaneously remaining hands-off on the actual production. The filing also states that, "Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only Subnautica 2, but also Subnautica 3, Subnautica 4, and any other future Subnautica franchise product."</p><p>Subnautica 2 is currently set to have its early-access release in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>There were some severe consequences for BioWare last year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> stumbled out of the gate and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a>. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off a lot of BioWare's staff</a> and left a much smaller team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. But there may be a silver lining to that, according to former BioWare employee Mark Darrah.</p><p>Darrah--who served as an executive producer on the first three Dragon Age games before leaving BioWare--recently joined <a href="https://youtu.be/1Pd9OG3HmN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a> and shared his belief that the remaining BioWare devs should "scapegoat" The Veilguard to get every resource they need from EA.</p><p>"To be frank, the Mass Effect team is going to be able to point to The Veilguard and say, 'We should steer away from some of these things, because look what happened,'" said Darrah. "I would honestly encourage that team to scapegoat Veilgard as much as they need to to get what they need from the organization, whether it's true or not."</p><p>During the same interview, Darrah recalled that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/" data-ref-id="1100-6533843">BioWare attempted to get a Dragon Age trilogy remaster off the ground</a>, but didn't get a favorable response from EA. The Veilguard went through a difficult development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">that included a shift to a live-service model</a> before it was redeveloped as a single-player game. Former BioWare employees have also said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams didn't get along</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect producer Mike Gamble recently teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-will-carry-over-a-piece-of-the-series-signature-style-apparently/1100-6532042/" data-ref-id="1100-6532042">the next game will maintain the series' signature lens flare</a>. The Mass Effect TV series in development at Prime Video also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-show-brings-on-one-of-its-most-important-creative-roles-report/1100-6532187/" data-ref-id="1100-6532187">recently added showrunner Doug Jung</a>.</p>
