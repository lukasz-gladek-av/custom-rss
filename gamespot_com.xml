                <p>Although Assassin's Creed Shadows won't be available through Xbox Game Pass, at least at launch, there will be a perk for subscribers. Game Pass Ultimate members who purchase Shadows will have have the ability to play the game through Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p>Microsoft just revealed this feature as part of its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“stream your own game”</a> perk for Ultimate tier subscribers. However, this only applies to digital copies of games, not physical ones. "Stream your own game" is different than Xbox’s own Play Anywhere program, which gives players both native Windows PC and Xbox versions of games if they purchase either one.</p><p>Certain games in the Game Pass library can be streamed, but not all of them. If a game leaves Game Pass, it can normally no longer be streamed even if it's been purchased. That makes this feature particularly useful, although it remains unclear how widely it will be supported. Some other games that are part of the "stream your own game" feature are Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, Cyberpunk 2077, and Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on March 20 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The game was also just confirmed to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-support-steam-deck-at-release-ubisoft-confirms/1100-6530082/" data-ref-id="1100-6530082">Deck Verified</a>, meaning that It can run properly on Steam Deck. For PlayStation players, those who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-on-ps5-pro-will-have-an-extra-fancy-ray-tracing-mode/1100-6529947/" data-ref-id="1100-6529947">play the game on PS5 Pro</a> will have access to advanced ray-tracing modes to enhance its visuals.</p><p>Those who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-strategy-guide-is-discounted-at-amazon/1100-6527284/" data-ref-id="1100-6527284">preorder Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will receive the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that will be released later this year. However, the expansion will still be available to purchase separately at a later date.</p><p>In GameSpot’s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-feels-like-the-series-trying-to-come-to-terms-with-its-warring-halves/1100-6528968/" data-ref-id="1100-6528968">Assassin’s Creed Shadow preview</a>, we said, “If the superb world design, art direction, and music are any indication, I'm inclined to go into the full experience with hopeful expectations.”</p>

                <p>Polish developer People Can Fly has announced that it's making a game for Sony Interactive Entertainment based on an IP that Sony owns, though it remains to be seen what the game is.</p><p>In a <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, People Can Fly said the new game is in the works under the codename Project Delta. As part of the agreement between People Can Fly and Sony, <span>there will be a milestone process. Details weren't provided, but this is a common practice where development progress is reviewed at certain intervals.</span></p><p>People Can Fly did not divulge the specific scope and terms of its milestone agreement with Sony but said it does not differ much from standard work-for-hire projects of this nature. The Polish studio has a lot of experience in this department, as it has worked with big game companies on projects before, including Gears of War: Judgment with Microsoft, Fortnite: Saves the World with Epic, and Outriders with Square Enix. People Can Fly is also working with PUBG company Krafton on a new game codenamed <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/project-echo-agreement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Echo</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">collaborating with The Coalition on Gears of War: E-Day. </a></p><p>The official word is that People Can Fly's game with Sony is "based on the intellectual property rights owned by" Sony, but there is no word on what it is. It sounds like it could be an existing Sony franchise, but that is never stated outright in the document. Another document from People Can Fly describes the agreement as<a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-3-2025-commencement-of-negotiations-with-sony-disclosure-of-delayed-inside-information-final.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> covering work to create a prototype</a>.</p><p>Founded in 2002, People Can Fly released the first-person shooter Painkiller in 2004 as its first game. Epic Games took a majority ownership of the company in 2007 following the cancellation of People Can Fly's game Come Midnight with now-defunct publisher THQ. In 2012, Epic bought People Can Fly and re-named it Epic Games Poland, but in 2015, People Can Fly became independent again.</p>

                <p>Bethesda's 2023 RPG Starfield is not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">ruled out for PS5</a>, but it also hasn't been announced for Sony's system like some of Bethesda's other games have, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/" data-ref-id="1100-6526483">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Now, a listing on Bethesda's modding website might suggest a PS5 edition of the game is coming. </p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1jb6ldu/they_have_added_the_playstation_logo_to_a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user Dollar99Man</a> reshared a finding from YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@510DeshawnPlays/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">510deshawn</a> who discovered that the Bethesda Creation Kit website for Starfield was updated with the PlayStation logo, sitting alongside the logos for PC and Xbox. However, the Starfield Creation Kit hub <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not allow players to choose "PlayStation" as a platform in the filter</a>, despite the logo appearing on one of the mod's pages.</p><p>It's possible to<a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=PS&amp;sort=created_at&amp;timePeriod=ALL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> tweak the URL</a> to force the filter to show mods listed for PlayStation. For a period of time today, March 14, this displayed one result for the mod listed for PlayStation. However, it has since been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675" data-ratio="0.52787663107948" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4459675"></a><figcaption>A PlayStation listing sits alongside Xbox and PC platforms for a Starfield mod.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4459675-screenshot2025-03-14at1.32.45pm.png"></figure><p>It's possible this whole thing was an error and that it doesn't signal any kind of forthcoming announcement from Bethesda.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was asked directly if he could confirm that Starfield would remain exclusive to Xbox on console. He said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">"No,"</a> going on to state that he sees no reason to ever "put a ring fence around any game" and say it could never come to a platform where it could find an audience and bring in money for Microsoft. </p><p>Starfield coming to PS5 would fit within Xbox's strategy of bringing more games to PlayStation. However, the wait for Starfield to come to PS5 has been lengthier compared to some of the other Xbox games that eventually came to PS5.</p><p>Starfield launched in September 2023 and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-passes-15-million-players-as-game-adds-new-vehicle-and-quest/1100-6527873/#:~:text=Starfield%20has%20crossed%20a%20new,quest%2C%20fixes%2C%20and%20more." data-ref-id="1100-6527873">reached more than 15 million players.</a> Bethesda recently acknowledged that fans are eager for updates, adding that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"hard at work" on new content</a>, but it's too soon to reveal anything. "We have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right," Bethesda said.</p>

                <p>The God of War franchise is turning 20 years old later this month, and to celebrate, developer Sony Santa Monica has announced a free update to God of War Ragnarok that'll go live on March 20.
