                <p>Enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro has weighed in on the question of AI in game development, saying that AI is set to make human game devs obsolete within 50 years. He predicted that AI would be used to create narratives that are specially crafted towards each player individually.</p><p>Yoko Taro, best known for his work on the Nier series, spoke on AI as part of a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/40366" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a> roundtable for upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-releases-this-friday-limited-edition-still-available/1100-6531012/" data-ref-id="1100-6531012">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> alongside Jiro Ishii and two of The Hundred Line's developers.</p><p>The developers all agreed that AI will quickly become mainstream in game development, and discussed where that would leave the industry. "I think that AI will make all game creators unemployed. In 50 years, game creators may be treated like bards," Yoko Taro said, predicting a time where human-made game development will be seen as an obsolete craft.</p><p>When asked if AI had the potential to create the kind of fantastical stories that human developers make, the panel generally agreed that it would be able to reach that point. "I think that in the near future, we will move from an era where we have to imitate the style of our favorite creators to an era where we can have our favorite scenarios generated," Yoko added. "AI will determine the preferences of users and skillfully generate route branchings that they would want to read, and the recommendation capabilities will continue to improve."</p><p>Hundred Line director Kazutaka Kodaka added that this kind of AI-driven design would take away the ability for players to share the same experience of a game, making them less likely to become a worldwide hit.</p><p>As AI becomes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">increasingly common</a> in both the creative and technical side of game development, game-industry figures and bosses have weighed in on the technology. Many game-industry executives have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">spoken positively</a> about AI, many of them from the same companies that have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-games-goes-through-another-round-of-layoffs-180-employees-affected/1100-6519137/" data-ref-id="1100-6519137">laid off staff</a> in the last few years. Kingdom Come 2 director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">Daniel Vavra said</a> he hopes AI could help him and his staff make games faster, while Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p><p>Using AI to replace creative work such as art and voice acting remains very controversial. The SAG-AFTRA voice-actors strike is currently in its ninth month with no end in sight--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-publishers-have-too-many-alarming-ai-loopholes-says-striking-actors-union/1100-6530074/" data-ref-id="1100-6530074">AI protections</a> one of the big issues on the table.</p>

<p>Tsentzelis later posted a full video of his transaction at the store, where a GameStop employee can be heard asking him to create a bundle with a minimum item quantity. Even after bundling a MicroSD card, Donkey Kong Bananza, the Mario Kart World bundle, and a Pro Controller, Tsentzelis is told he needs to add two more items.</p><p>In the replies to the post, most other X users say they had no issue preordering the console by itself at other GameStop stores, though some had similar stories of aggressive upselling of Switch 2 games, accessories, or warranties at some GameStop locations. Others claim they were told they needed a GameStop Pro Membership to preorder, or at least were heavily pressured into signing up for the membership.</p><p>GameStop's support account has now <a href="https://x.com/GameStopHelp/status/1915577303905767705" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded</a> to Tsentzelis' post, saying the company is "actively investigating" the matter. "Any customer who was turned away at the Astoria location should reach out via DM so we can make it right," the post read. At present the Astoria store is the only one mentioned by the GameStop support account.</p><p>The entire preorder experience for the Switch 2 has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">a little chaotic so far</a>, with US preorders delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">due to Trump's tariffs</a>, and the console's major US stock experienced high demand and technical issues when online orders opened. Console preorders are now sold out for the time being, though many of the games and accessories are still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">available for preorder</a>. Switch 2 preorders are already being listed on eBay--but be careful to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-units-are-already-dropping-on-ebay-some-arent-what-they-seem/1100-6531090/" data-ref-id="1100-6531090">check what you're buying</a> if you're planning to go down that route.</p>

The Starfell Treasure Box will retail for £55 (approximately $75), and features the following items:</p><ul><li>Charlotte's Magic Water Cream [15ml]</li><li>Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray [34ml]</li><li>Charlotte's Magic Serum Crystal Elixir [Deluxe sample]</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Eye Mask</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Compact Mirror</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Drawstring Pouch</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact In-Game Rewards [Primogems x160, Hero's Wit x5, Sanctifying Unction x5, Mora x50,000]</li></ul><p>The Starry Miracle Box, on the other hand, will cost £155 (approximately $209), and contains the following full-sized beauty products and accessories:</p><ul><li>Charlotte's Magic Cream [30ml]</li><li>Cryo-Recovery Eye Serum [15ml]</li><li>Charlotte's Magic Lip Oil Crystal Elixir [Full-size]</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Stickers</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Tote Bag</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Pin Badge</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Headband</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact Makeup Bag</li><li>Charlotte Tilbury x Genshin Impact In-Game Rewards [Primogems x300, Hero's Wit x10, Sanctifying Unction x5, Mystic Enhancement Ore x10, Mora x50,000]</li></ul><p>It is important to note that the in-game rewards code found inside each of the boxes can only be redeemed through July 30, so be sure to use them sooner rather than later. Though you can purchase Primogems in-game, most of the included items are not available to buy in Genshin Impact, making them all the more useful.</p><p>Charlotte Tilbury MBE, founder and chief creative officer of the makeup and beauty brand, said she found "perfect harmony with the mystical form of Mona Megistus," which is in part what inspired the collaboration:</p><p>"The mysterious and mesmerizing astrologist shares my love for the stars and divine artistry, and we both have boundless passion and dedication, which allows us to think limitlessly and pursue our biggest and boldest dreams, whether it's in Teyvat or the real world!" Charlotte Tilbury MBE wrote in the press release. "That's why each magic box is Mona-inspired and filled with exclusive limited-edition collectibles, from a velvety makeup bag to cosplay essentials. There is something for everyone to love--it's the perfect gift for everyone from gamers to skincare lovers and more."</p><p>Earlier this week, GameSpot's own Lucy James was sent both the Genshin Impact Starfell Treasure Box and the Starry Miracle Box.
