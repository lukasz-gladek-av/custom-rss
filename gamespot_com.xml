                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian just recently launched its acclaimed previous game, Divinity: Original Sin II, on Switch 2, and studio boss Swen Vincke said he tried hard to cut one element in particular for the new release.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/larian-ceo-swen-vincke-in-interview-i-hate-the-squirrel-and-the-great-freedom-for-divinity-after-baldurs-gate-3,1542810/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mein-MMO</a>, Vincke responded to the interviewer saying they are a big fan of the game's squirrel NPC, <a href="https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Sir+Lora" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sir Lora</a>. Vincke hates the little critter and wanted him gone for the re-release.</p><p>"It's funny that you like Sir Lora. I hate him. If there is one thing I regret about Original Sin 2, it's bringing Sir Lora into the game," he said.</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he "tried to remove him from the Switch 2 version," but Larian's QA team informed him that it was "too late."</p><p>"I really tried to get rid of him," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYWITWd1GJk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yYWITWd1GJk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Vincke added that his Head of QA informed him that the team undertook efforts to cut Sir Lora and the team "almost succeeded." But the problem was that removing Sir Lora led to an issue where "it works in one region and not in another."</p><p>"We couldn't figure out why. Sir Lora just wouldn't die. We lost several days debugging to find an answer to that. Now it's too late, so we have to keep him," he said.</p><p>Vincke also shared some Sir Lora lore, saying the publisher behind Original Sin II wanted to have free DLC for the game, so Larian created the squirrel NPC "as a joke that doesn't really add anything to the game."</p><p>"Later we regretted bringing Sir Lora in because it only happened due to publisher pressure. And now we just want to get rid of him. But it's okay; it makes me happy that you enjoy him. There are people who put a lot of effort into creating him," Vincke said.</p><p>Original Sin II just launched for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">free upgrade available</a> for people who already own the game on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch.</p><p>Larian's next game is a new Divinity title, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">will not have any AI-created content in it</a>. The developer used generative AI to create concept art and to help with other development processes, however.</p><p>"It's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse," Vincke said, attempting to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">concerns raised by developers.</a></p>

While they're not the newest iteration of Sony's premium noise-canceling headphones (those are the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM</a>6), they offer impressive noise cancellation. Sound quality is excellent as well, and it can be further customized using the companion Sony Sound Connect app. They also offer up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and quick charging support that can restore three hours of playback in just three minutes of charging.</p><p>As for the WF-C700N earbuds, they may not be as popular as AirPods, but they're still a great option, offering IPX4 water resistance, multiple silicone earbud tips, a built-in microphone for hands-free calling, and the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously.</p><p>If you're shopping around for other headphone deals, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PT1VBL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony WH-1000XM6</a> headphones are also on sale for $398 (was $460) ahead of the holidays. This matches the all-time low price from Black Friday, though it's still quite a bit more expensive than the older WH-1000XM5. Most shoppers will find the WH-1000XM5 bundle to be the best offer right now, but if you need the latest and greatest gear, it's nice to see the XM6 back down to the same price as they were in late November.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Personalized-Compatibility/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones are also quite cheap right now, with Amazon listing them for $180 (was $350). Offering up to 40 hours of battery life and a stylish design, they could be a nice alternative to the WH-1000XM5. Most colors are eligible for the discount, too, so it shouldn't be hard to snag something that fits your style.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-se-arcade-machines-pac-man-ms-pac-man-mortal-kombat-amazon-deals/1100-6534472/">Arcade1Up Classic Special Edition Cabinets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>While learning a language is challenging, it's never been easier to start, thanks to the abundance of learning apps and online classes. One of the longest-running and highest-rated of these is <a href="https://go.linkby.com/ONMGOMZQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rosetta Stone</a>. The service offers comprehensive courses in 25 languages, all of which use a unique immersion learning style, making it one of the most effective language learning programs out there. Of course, as with any language-learning program, the trick is to stick with it--luckily, Rosetta Stone is offering <strong>a limited-time discount on lifetime subscriptions</strong>, dropping the price to<strong> just $149 (was $400)</strong>, which could make it much easier to commit to the process.</p><p>While the Lifetime Subscription is arguably the best deal, it's not the only Rosetta Stone discount. The 3-Month Plan is on sale for $48 (was $60; billed every three months), while the 12-Month Plan is $126 (was $240; billed every 12 months). While the Lifetime Plan includes all 25 languages (listed below), monthly plans only unlock a single language--making the lifetime subscription by far the best deal. All plans offer a 30-day money-back guarantee. Rosetta Stone also lets you gift plans to others, which could make this deal a fun holiday gift. Here's a look at all the options side-by-side:</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Subscription Discounts</h2><ul><li>Lifetime Plan -- $149 (<del>$400</del>) (single payment) | Includes 25 languages</li><li>12-month plan -- $126 (<del>$240</del>) (billed annually) | Includes one language</li><li>3-month plan -- $48 (<del>$60</del>) (billed every 3 months) | Includes one language</li></ul><p>Rosetta Stone's deals are only available for a limited time, so be sure to sign up at these discounted rates before they disappear.</p><p>Rosetta Stone offers mobile and web apps, all of which grant you access to the same set of lessons, activities, and learning tools. Rosetta Stone uses an immersion learning approach where lessons primarily use the langauge you're trying to learn, rather than relying on explanations and translations in your native language, especially as you pass the early lessons. That may sound more intimidating than, say, Duolingo, but the upshot is this approach is closer to how you would learn a language if you moved to a new country, which helps your brain learn the information faster.</p><p>Along with the lesson plans, Rosetta Stone also includes access to free livestream classes and interactive activities like Seek &amp; Speak visual vocabulary scavenger hunts, a collection of stories read by native speakers, and a Phrasebook filled with common words and phrases that use Rosetta Stone's proprietary TruAccent tool to aid in your pronunciation accuracy. The vast majority of Rosetta Stone's content is also downloadable and usable offline.</p><h2>Rosetta Stone Languages</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Arabic</li><li dir="ltr">Chinese (Mandarin)</li><li dir="ltr">Dutch</li><li dir="ltr">English (American)</li><li dir="ltr">English (British)</li><li dir="ltr">Farsi (Persian)</li><li dir="ltr">French</li><li dir="ltr">German</li><li dir="ltr">Greek</li><li dir="ltr">Hebrew</li><li dir="ltr">Hindi</li><li dir="ltr">Irish</li><li dir="ltr">Italian</li><li dir="ltr">Japanese</li><li dir="ltr">Korean</li><li dir="ltr">Latin</li><li dir="ltr">Polish</li><li dir="ltr">Portuguese (Brazil)</li><li dir="ltr">Russian</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Latin America)</li><li dir="ltr">Spanish (Spain)</li><li dir="ltr">Swedish</li><li dir="ltr">Tagalog (Filipino)</li><li dir="ltr">Turkish</li><li dir="ltr">Vietnamese</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">Nintendo Switch 2 Samsung 256GB MicroSD Express Card On Sale For Only $33</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-exclusive-lego-sets-best-deals-holiday-2025-sale/1100-6536986/">Target's Best Exclusive Lego Sets Get Rare Holiday Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controllers On Sale For Even Better Prices Than Black Friday Deals</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-pixel-remasters-nintendo-switch-playstation-best-amazon-deal/1100-6527670/">Final Fantasy I-VI Pixel Remaster Collection Is Back On Sale For Black Friday Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-nintendo-switch-2-wheel-set-for-mario-kart-gets-first-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536789/">Nintendo Switch 2 Racing Wheel Set Drops To $20 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-gets-110-discount-at-amazon/1100-6536577/">Asus ROG Xbox Ally Gets $110 Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-rosalina-storybook-nintendo-switch-book-deal/1100-6534724/">Super Mario Galaxy: Rosalina's Storybook Gets 30% Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psvr-2-horizon-call-of-the-mountain-bundle-is-still-on-sale-for-all-time-best-price/1100-6529777/">PSVR 2 Horizon Call Of The Mountain Bundle Is Still On Sale For All-Time Best Price</a></li>   </ul> </div>
