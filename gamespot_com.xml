                <p>The long-rumored remake of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is indeed real, and fans don't have to wait another minute to play it. Bethesda has officially announced the remaster and it's out now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, and it's also available for purchase on those platforms for $50. A PS5 version is available, too.</p><p>The game is developed by Virtuos in partnership with Bethesda, running on Unreal Engine 5 and sporting better visuals. The Remastered version includes the base game and story expansions Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine. Beyond an updated look, the game features a new leveling system.</p><p>There are also new lines of dialogue, sprinting support, blood splatter effects where previously there were none, and better lighting effects, Bethesda said. You can get a closer look at the game in the announcement trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ed_E2crglcw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A digital deluxe edition ($60) is available as well. This includes, you guessed it, horse armor sets, along with special armors and weapons. Players also get a digital artbook and a soundtrack app, along with the Fighter's Stronghold expansion, Spell Tome Treasures, Vile Lair, Mehrune's Razor, The Thieves Den, Wizardâ€™s Tower, Orrery, and Horse Pack Armor.</p><p>A remaster of Oblivion has been rumored for years, dating back to when it was first mentioned in the court documents that came out of the Microsoft vs. FTC case. The surprise-launch is not shocking, either, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remake-will-shadowdrop-at-any-moment-this-month-report/1100-6530652/" data-ref-id="1100-6530652">that's exactly what reports said would happen with this title.</a></p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance developer Warhorse hasn't announced any future projects, but game director Daniel Vavra has ideas. He said in an interview that he has "a couple of projects" in mind that could, he estimates, have "as big potential as Kingdom Come: Deliverance." The developer added that he's hopeful the "AI revolution" gets here soon so he can make more games before retiring.</p><p>Vavra didn't go into detail on what these ideas might be, but he did tell <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a> that he hopes the "AI revolution" can help him and his staff make games faster. He said new AI technologies will not replace human developers but will help them build faster.</p><p>"It really annoys me that the games take so much time, because I have more ideas than I have time," he said. "There are a couple of projects that I would love to do. And I would love to prepare them properly, so it's not as chaotic. I hope that the AI revolution will help with this, where in the future we will not be replaced by AI, but we will be helped by AI. So a lot of the things could get easier and faster."</p><p>A recent study found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">most developers worldwide are already using AI technologies</a> to help make games, despite concerns from workers about it. It's not immediately clear if AI was used in the development of Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.</p><p>While Vavra isn't ready to discuss any new projects from Warhorse, he did dig into the state of the AAA gaming market, saying publishers are understandably risk-averse when they fund a game for $200 million. Instead, he said it might be smart to relatively make smaller bets on games with $50 million budgets, so that some could flop but others that might succeed could make up the difference.</p><p>"So being faster, cheaper, and with more risk would probably could solve some of those issues," he said.</p><p>He also mentioned how the recent wave of mass layoffs in the video game industry might "clean the waters" and help inspire people to come up with new creative ideas. "Hopefully some people who lost the spirit because of how industry works will return or start new companies, and do new stuff. I would really welcome some fresh air and new stuff," he said.</p><p>Whatever Warhorse makes next, it'll likely be made under Warhorse owner Embracer. Vavra said Embracer has not been affected by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-ceo-says-he-deserves-criticism-after-mass-layoffs-and-game-cancellations/1100-6522874/" data-ref-id="1100-6522874">Embracer's deep cuts in recent times</a>, noting that Embracer gives Warhorse "a lot of trust."</p><p>"There was almost zero outside influence on the creative decisions on the game. Which is great if it works, and when you are not insane. I understand that the corporation wants to have some control over the final product when it invests a lot of money, but generally we had a lot of freedom and it worked," he said.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II launched in February and has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-studio-reports-its-approaching-2-million-sales/1100-6529486/" data-ref-id="1100-6529486">sold more than 2 million copies</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning strong reviews.</a> The game has multiple paid expansions planned for 2025, but fans don't have to wait for something new, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-patch-1-2-4-brings-hardcore-mode-to-the-medieval-rpg/1100-6530882/" data-ref-id="1100-6530882">a Hardcore mode was just recently added.</a></p>

                <p>Ahead of its release on April 25, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-rides-for-ps5-this-year/1100-6529467/">Days Gone Remastered</a> developer Bend Studio has revealed several new details on the game's accessibility features. One of the new additions relates to gameplay, as players will be able to slow down the overall game speed to 25%, allowing them to have more time when dealing with stressful situations like a massive horde of Freakers.</p><p><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/22/days-gone-remastered-accessibility-features-detailed/" rel="nofollow ">Bend Studio explained in a blog post</a> that adjusting the game speed is ideal for players who might have difficulty with various inputs in high-pressure moments, and with the remastered game adding a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-horde-mode-detailed-for-ps5-and-pc/1100-6530764/">new Horde Assault mode</a>, this option allows for more people to enjoy it. Other gameplay features coming to Days Gone Remastered include the option to auto-complete quick-time events on any difficulty, the ability to recenter the camera on attack, haptic vibration intensity sliders, field-of-view adjustments, and customizable controls.</p><p>Like several other Sony first-party games, the accessibility upgrades also cover the audio and visual parts of the game. Bend Studio says that it has added high-contrast options to make it easier for players to see certain elements in the game--like protagonist Deacon St. John or the HUD--and the game now has a fully revised and improved audio mix.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4480327-days-gone-high-contrast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4480327-days-gone-high-contrast.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480327"></a><figcaption>A closer look at the new high-contrast option in Days Gone Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4480327-days-gone-high-contrast.jpg"></figure><p>If you're a fan of collecting stuff in video games, there'll now be audio cues and haptic feedback prompts to let you know when you're close to any of the 240 collectibles scattered across the world of Days Gone. "Most" of these new accessibility features will also come to the PC version of Days Gone as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1259420/Days_Gone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Broken Roads DLC</a>.</p><p>If you happen to own Days Gone, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-preorders-are-now-live-ps4-owners-can-upgrade-for-just-10/1100-6529487/">upgrade from the PS4 version to PS5 by paying $10</a>, but this deal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/days-gone-remastered-10-upgrade-wont-apply-to-the-ps-plus-version/1100-6529538/">won't apply to the PS Plus version</a>.

cosmetics in the Berserk Reliquary, part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">Diablo 4's newly revamped battle-pass system</a>. Some of those items include a Brand of Sacrifice marking that can be used in character customization, as well as Skull Knight's shield as mount armor and Griffith's Helmet as a back trophy.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the cosmetics players are likely really looking for are all relegated to Diablo 4's in-game shop. That includes series protagonist Guts' Berserker armor, as well as looks for series antagonist Griffith, the mysterious Skull Knight, and an armor set inspired by Guts' mercenary days. Griffith's steed and accompanying mount armor will also be for sale, alongside a pet bundle featuring the all-nose Chimimoryo.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's free-to-play mobile game Diablo Immortal is also getting in on the Berserk action, and in many ways has more to do than Diablo 4. It will add a boss fight against the fearsome Nosferatu Zodd, and even let players participate in Berserk's most infamous moment: the Eclipse.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Berserk manga and anime, the Eclipse is the story's bleakest point, where just about everyone dies, to put things lightly. While the Eclipse is active in Diablo Immortal, players will be transported to a nightmarish hellscape where they will need to band together to fight for their lives as if they had been marked with the Brand of Sacrifice, and can even encounter a new boss sent to do the Godhand's bidding.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal is additionally introducing a new Legendary Gem inspired by the Crimson Behelit, which will increase damage dealt while above 50% health, reduce damage dealt when below 30% health, and can release a howl of terror to fear nearby enemies. New Golem familiar skins will also be added.</p><p dir="ltr">There will of course be cosmetic armor sets based on the Berserker armor and Griffith's armor for sale as well, in addition to some free Berserk-themed login rewards that can be claimed. Those free login rewards include a free weapon-appearance cosmetic, among them Guts' Dragonslayer greatsword, though the first weapon cosmetic claimed will be specific to the class currently being played--so choose wisely.</p><p>Diablo 4 Season 8 begins April 29, and will introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Lair Boss system which overhauls much of Diablo 4's endgame</a> loop. Blizzard recently laid out what to expect for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 in a 2025 roadmap</a>--one that includes more endgame revamps and another still unannounced IP crossover. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion won't be coming until 2026</a>.</p>

                <p>A newly launched Call of Duty store bundle is themed around bacon. The "Sizzlin'" tracer pack, as it's called, includes a variety of cosmetics based on the salt-cured pork treat, along with a death effect that turns enemies into strips of bacon when eliminated.</p><p>The Sizzlin' tracer pack is one of COD's most expensive bundles, carrying a cost of 3,000 COD Points--that's about $30. For that, players get multiple weapon variants that add strips of bacon to your guns, along with a special skin, "Not Enough Bacon," which is basically a ghillie suit made of bacon.</p><p>The special bacon-themed death effect, meanwhile, turns enemies into strips of bacon, while the bundle also comes with a cast iron frying pan melee weapon. There is a finishing move called "Pan Fried," in which the player sizzles their enemy's face in a pan of bacon grease.</p><p>Check out the video below from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JCAmaterasu">JC Amaterasu</a> to see a full rundown of what's in the bundle. This store bundle is available for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Z4UxFx9KrQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Z4UxFx9KrQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Call of Duty is known for its wacky and over-the-top store bundles, so this bacon-themed offering is in keeping with that tradition. The game also just recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-introduces-john-black-ops-as-free-operator-skin/1100-6530443/" data-ref-id="1100-6530443">John Black Ops. </a></p>
