                <p>After adding two-player expeditions in the last <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> update, From Software's latest patch is adding some balance adjustments to the powerful abilities that come with the legendary sword known as Storm Ruler.</p><p>Going forward, it won't take as long to charge the storm effect and the animation speed of the blade will be faster. Overall, the performance of Storm Ruler will be increased, even when the attack power isn't charged with the storm. However, those upgrades come with a tweak that removes the bug that allowed players to use Storm Ruler without burning through FP.</p><p>The update also includes a number of other bug fixes, including one that addresses slowdown for other players when using too many Sorceries and Incantations. Performance issues appear to have been the main problems addressed in the patch, but there were others as well, including a bug that prevented some attacks of the Everdark Sovereign Caligo, Miasma of Night from hitting other players.</p><p>There was also one bug fix that specific to PlayStation 5, where both the user interface and the heads-up display might disappear for players. That bug might be followed by the game crashing altogether if players attempted to continue playing.</p><p>What's coming next for Nightreign after this patch? A recent datamine suggests that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-ranked-mode-could-be-coming-according-to-datamine/1100-6533778/" data-ref-id="1100-6533778">a ranked mode may be debuting on Nightreign</a> in the future. Last month, Bandai Namco and From Software announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">Nightreign has shipped 5 million copies</a> since its debut at the end of May.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-confirmed-for-switch-2/1100-6530541/" data-ref-id="1100-6530541">Tarnished Edition for Nintendo Switch 2</a> later this year, which will include the base game and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion.

                <p dir="ltr">Some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> players charge into battle swinging broadswords, others rain arrows from afar, and then some prefer to watch the world burn from a safe distance. If your idea of fun involves turning mana into spectacular destruction, Terraria’s magic weapons are your bread and butter. From humble sparks to kaleidoscopic death rays, these staves of sorcery are the ultimate tools for mages looking to leave a scorching impression.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic wands in Terraria are more than just damage sticks. The best ones combine range, style, and special effects that can turn tricky boss fights into theatrical light shows. Our picks cover every stage of the game, from your first foray into the forests to the celestial gauntlet at the very end. Whether you’re into precise spellwork or screen-filling chaos, here’s what you should have in your arsenal.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Wand_of_Sparking">Wand of Sparking</a></li><li><a href="#Magic_Missile">Magic Missile</a></li><li><a href="#Demon_Scythe">Demon Scythe</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Crystal_Storm">Crystal Storm</a></li><li><a href="#Betsy___s_Wrath">Betsy’s Wrath</a></li><li><a href="#Last_Prism">Last Prism</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Abracadabra">Abracadabra</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549327"></a><figcaption>Terraria's Wand of Sparking in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549327-best-terraria-magic-weapons-wand-of-sparking.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Wand_of_Sparking">Wand of Sparking</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 0</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 14%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 26 (Average)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you’re fresh out of character creation and still rocking copper tools, the Wand of Sparking is your first taste of arcane power. It’s not subtle, shooting tiny flames with modest damage, but it’s notably accessible. You can find it in surface chests or wooden crates from fishing, meaning there’s a decent chance you’ll be clearing out caves and singeing zombies before you’ve even built a proper house.</p><p dir="ltr">It has the lowest mana cost in the game at just two per shot, letting you spam fire bolts without worrying too much about blue star supplies. Equip early mana-boosting accessories like the Magic Cuffs for a touch more staying power, and it’ll carry you comfortably until stronger dungeon loot appears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549328"></a><figcaption>Magic Missile floats towards its target</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549328-best-terraria-magic-weapons-magic-missle.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Missile">Magic Missile</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 22 (Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Looted from Dungeon chests after defeating Skeletron, the Magic Missile feels like an upgrade in both power and control. You guide its projectile with your cursor until you release it or it hits an obstacle, letting you strike around corners or through gaps. The explosion on impact is perfect for clearing out enemies huddled behind cover.</p><p dir="ltr">The only catch is the moderate mana cost, but by the time you find one, you should have a healthy pool to work with. Pair it with the Jungle Armour set for early magic bonuses, and you’ll have a spell that can comfortably handle most pre-Hardmode bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549329"></a><figcaption>Demon Scythe shoots Demon Sickles at a Herpling</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549329-best-terraria-magic-weapons-demon-scythe.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Demon_Scythe">Demon Scythe</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 35</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost:14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Demons in the Underworld, the Demon Scythe is a deceptively strong choice for players with good aim. It summons scythe projectiles that deal very high damage and can pierce multiple enemies at once. The initial slow travel speed makes it less ideal for fast-moving targets, but it’s a blessing against the flailing limbs of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> like Skeletron and Wall of Flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming this means braving the lava-filled Underworld, so bring Obsidian Skin Potions and a ranged backup weapon in case those Demons get too close. At this point, you’ll be ready to transition to Hardmode, as the Demon Scythe is one of the few early magic weapons that keeps pace with the rising stakes, including faster enemies with higher health pools.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549330"></a><figcaption>Crystal Storm ricochets off Temple walls</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549330-best-terraria-magic-weapons-crystal-storm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Crystal_Storm">Crystal Storm</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 32</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 7 (Extremely fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Crafted from 20 Crystal Shards, 15 Souls of Light, and a Spell Tome using a Bookcase, the Crystal Storm turns you into a walking bullet hell machine. Its rapid-fire projectiles ricochet off walls, chewing through enemies in tight arenas, which is particularly ideal for crowd control in events and invasions.</p><p dir="ltr">The low individual mana cost is deceptive, as each shot rapidly drains your reserves. You’ll need the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories for magic</a> in early Hardmode and potions to sustain fire for long stretches. Pair it with the Mana Flower or Celestial Cuffs, and you’ll fend off the Pirate Invasion like few other weapons can at this stage of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549331"></a><figcaption>Betsy's Wrath rains down in threes</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549331-best-terraria-magic-weapons-betsys-wrath.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Betsy___s_Wrath">Betsy’s Wrath</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by Betsy in the Old One’s Army event, which only occurs after you’ve defeated the Golem, Betsy’s Wrath is a versatile magic weapon. Firing a trio of fireballs, the magic weapon not only covers a wider area than most alternatives, but it also inflicts the Betsy’s Curse debuff, which substantially reduces your enemy’s defence.</p><p dir="ltr">As you navigate the third act, Betsy’s Wrath is a perfect choice for boss fights and multiplayer scenarios, boosting overall team damage. Its fast firing rate and good range make it a flexible all-rounder in Hardmode. Just make sure you have the space, as low ceilings hinder the weapon’s effectiveness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549332"></a><figcaption>Converged Last Prism fires a singular beam</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4549332-best-terraria-magic-weapons-last-prism.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Last_Prism">Last Prism</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 100</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 0.25</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 10 (Very fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Dropped by the Moon Lord, the Last Prism is Terraria’s ultimate magic weapon, firing a rainbow beam that converges into pure, boss-melting energy. It’s absurdly mana-hungry, draining reserves in seconds, but with Nebula Armour, Celestial Cuffs, and Mana Regeneration Potions, you can keep it firing long enough to erase even the game’s toughest foes.</p><p dir="ltr">For sustained output, tap-fire to conserve mana between bursts; for sheer spectacle, hold it down and watch the world disappear in light. Nothing else comes close to its mix of style and raw, unstoppable power, giving you the victory lap you truly deserve.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Abracadabra">Abracadabra</h2><p dir="ltr">Magic wands offer a unique flavour of combat compared to other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a>, trading brute force for precision, style, and sometimes outright spectacle. Whether you’re igniting slimes in the forest, painting laser trails across the sky, or collapsing bosses under a prism of doom, there’s a spell to match your mood and progression.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep your mana high, your gear in top form, and your spellbook stocked because when the next boss arrives, you’ll want more than just firepower. You’ll want a little magic.</p>

                <p>The storytellers behind Blizzard's Story and Franchise Development team have decided to unionize. Following the results of a union-authorization vote, Blizzard's SFD will now join the Communications Workers of America in Orange County, California. Additionally, Microsoft has voluntarily recognized the SFD team's union vote.</p><p>There have been two previous unionization votes at Blizzard in the past year. In July 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">the developers behind World of Warcraft voted to unionize</a> and joined CWA.

"For years, Blizzard has been a place where people could build their careers and stay for decades, but that stability's been fading. With a union, we're able to preserve what makes this place special, secure real transparency in how decisions are made, and make sure policies are applied fairly to everyone."</p><p>During the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/">latest round of layoffs at Microsoft</a> last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-rumble-will-receive-no-new-content-amidst-layoffs-at-blizzard/1100-6532929/" data-ref-id="1100-6532929">Blizzard lost many members of the team dedicated</a> to the mobile game Warcraft Rumble. Across Microsoft as a whole, approximately 9,000 jobs were lost.</p><p>Earlier this month, Diablo general manager <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-boss-departs-blizzard-after-five-years/1100-6533809/" data-ref-id="1100-6533809">Rod Fergusson announced his departure from Blizzard</a> after spending half a decade with the company.

Additionally, Blizzard president Johanna Faries hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/" data-ref-id="1100-6530062">more TV and movies based on the studio's franchises</a> may eventually be made.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">My first Evo was all the way back in 2003, when it was held at Cal Poly Pomona. It was a ragtag yet passionate operation where a bunch of weirdos crammed into one of the university's big halls to play fighting games and watch the best of the best from across North America (and the Japanese players they convinced to come attend) duke it out. There were a bunch of PlayStation 2 consoles and arcade machines, a few projection screens, and some seats if you wanted to either watch or play some games. There were no ads or major announcements--the entertainment during downtime consisted of fan-made combo videos and somebody playing the overhead levels of Contra III. Despite all of the tech hiccups and the obvious drive to run things as cheaply as possible, we all <em>loved</em> it there.</p><p dir="ltr">Never would I have dreamed that, almost a quarter-century later, Evo would become one of gaming's most-talked-about annual events: a celebration of love and community in fighting games that even people not really into the genre would tune in to watch online. Evo now occupies an entire, massive hall in the Las Vegas Convention Center, where thousands of players from around the world come for a chance to compete and share their passion for fighting games in a variety of ways--be it entering tournaments, running side events, drawing and selling art in the Artists Alley, cosplaying, or just playing casual sets all day with people they've never met before. In a way, the main Evo event has morphed from a tournament into a full-blown fighting game convention, where the tournaments are now just a major part of the show, not necessarily the sole reason why many of the people are there.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">But with that rapid growth has come a massive price tag. If you didn't purchase admission early, a weekend competition pass to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/evo-2025-everything-announced-at-the-annual-three-day-fighting-game-fest/2900-6841/" data-ref-id="2900-6841">Evo 2025</a> was around $250, plus $10 for each of the official tournament games you wanted to enter. If you paid early and just wanted to watch or play casuals with other attendees, that would still set you back $180. That's not taking into account all of the other expenses: gas or airfare to get to Las Vegas, and then lodging, transportation, food once you're there. And that doesn't take into account a bunch of other miscellaneous expenses you might unexpectedly run into (Is your joystick bag too big? That's a checked-bag fee). Sure, there are ways to cut costs--the tried-and-true method of cramming a gaggle of people into a single hotel room is a favorite--but oftentimes they can wind up costing just as much or more. Staying at a cheaper hotel that's farther away from the LVCC? The moment you step into 105-degree Vegas summer heat, you're going to ditch the idea of walking and get a Lyft instead.</p><p dir="ltr">While Evo was just as lively this year as it was in 2024--and much better-run in general--several people I know who were usually reliable event attendees weren't there. In fact, the majority of the faces I saw frequently from attending weekly and monthly Portland-area fighting game gatherings didn't go to Evo. For some, a big reason was work or life conflicts, but even when those were factors, another thing always came up:<strong> "It's just too expensive."</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And it's not just Evo that's priced out of reach, either--a lot of big fighting game events have become quite costly to attend. My partner and I went to Combo Breaker in the Chicago suburbs in 2023 and had a fantastic time. We'd love to go back, but for us, it's almost as expensive as Evo. I'd like to attend Community Effort Orlando, but that's both an expensive outing and an extremely long flight from the Pacific Northwest. I can only afford to attend one big fighting game event per year, so I need to pick wisely.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't always like this. Fighting games are viewed as something of a "working class" esport. Many beloved players over the years have come from distinctly less-privileged backgrounds: inspirational tales of kids who had to get good at fighters because they wanted to make their quarters in the arcade last longer, or because they only had a few games for their console. Top players in all games have emerged from places all across the globe. The great class equalizer is "How well can you hit your buttons?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549280"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4549280-m3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite this, it's extremely hard for many players to be able to join these big competitions. Incredible players in many regions--including North America itself--are simply unable to come and compete on the global stage due to prices of travel, lodging, and tournament entry. Depending on your nationality, you might have a long, arduous, and expensive visa process before you can come and play anywhere else besides your home country--and you're not necessarily guaranteed approval. (It's a minor miracle that the Pakistani Tekken champions managed to get to their first Evo events at all a few years back.) For many talented but unknown players without sponsorships, these obstacles are exceptionally difficult to surmount.</p><p dir="ltr">Big tournaments can be an even harder sell if you're just a typical fighting game player. Statistically, you're probably not going to win Evo and recoup any prize money. In fact, you're very likely to go 0-2 in a major game. And most folks know that, so essentially, you're paying for a fun weekend with other fighting game nerds. But how much is the average fighting game player willing or able to pay for that experience when they can just go online to find people to spar against?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319" data-ratio="0.56164383561644" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549319"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549319-invincible4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's true that many younger fighting game players have likely grown through online competition, but many players also value the in-person, communal aspect of fighting games. But local options for smaller in-person meets and tournaments can be limited depending on where you live. Running even a small fighting game event can put you at a financial risk--event spaces don't come cheap, especially when internet packages are factored in (since events are generally expected to be livestreamed). Perhaps, if you're lucky, you can find a place willing to provide you some space at a discount--some of the monthly fighting game gatherings here in Portland happen at card and tabletop game stores and bars. Then you'll likely discover that being a Tournament Operator is a tiring, often thankless position. Many who try to establish local events go into burnout after a short while--it takes a certain mentality and dedication to make this work consistently, and not everyone can manage it.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to this, there's been a severe decrease in the number of established, moderately sized fighting game events over the past several years. As Evo and other big fighting game events increase in price, more affordable mid-size regionals like SoCal and NorCal Regionals, Kumite in Tennessee, and East Coast Throwdown have vanished. Some of these events were put on pause during COVID and never came back. Some grew too big for the hotel and college student-union ballrooms they were hosted in but weren't big enough to afford a convention space. Some went away because the organizers were just exhausted or needed to move on with life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549320"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549320-dead.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, the players who do have the means to attend the big events--either out of pocket or through sponsorships--tend to have an advantage. Events like the Capcom World Tour, the Tekken World Tour, and the SNK World Championship offer massive prize pots, but getting into these events often means entering as many big qualifiers as possible--which requires travel, and that requires money. And the sponsors are only willing to pay for events that look like good investments--meaning those small- and mid-size tournaments that are around struggle to bring in non-local top players that could encourage more people to attend.</p><p dir="ltr">This situation doesn't just hurt the players, but those who enjoy watching the games, too. Everyone loves seeing underdogs and/or new blood do well--just look at how many hearts the young Micky won over in his third-place Street Fighter 6 run at Evo this year. But think about the many other talented players out there we don't even know about who <em>could</em> have similar amazing performances on those grand stages. They can't, because the hurdles are too much to overcome.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png" data-ref-id="1300-4549321"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549321-gg.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">What can be done to fix this? It's difficult to come up with a clear solution, but there are ideas. Many publishers already hold online qualifiers for some of their big events, though there are caveats--in some cases, you still have to worry about your travel and lodging costs. The idea of global online tournaments is shaky, since even the most robust rollback netcode can buckle under the weight of a cross-continental journey--or even just shoddy Wi-Fi.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the publishers and hardware-makers themselves could help. Helping sponsor some smaller, local events in metro areas would be a step forward in community engagement, and could lay the groundwork for bigger, better events moving forward. Maybe a community "scholarship" fund could be established to help promising players afford travel to big events and make their mark. Maybe we can offer discounted event passes in some cases. I'm really just spitballing here, but it's clear that if we don't start to nip this problem in the bud, it could do lasting damage to the soul of the fighting game community.</p><p dir="ltr">While I had a fantastic time at Evo 2025 and am glad to see how far it's come, it also feels like it's veering in an alarming direction. The eye-rolling Chipotle ad placements are one thing--of course the commercial element is going to have to come in when the payouts get big. Rather, it's the fact that so many people I know won't or can't go to Evo anymore. Evo used to be where you went because all of your fighting game friends from everywhere would be there, together, for that one weekend of the year. But Evo and other big tournaments are feeling more and more exclusive. Fighting games should be open to everyone, and we need to make the path to potential glory as wide as possible.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: Origins was the start of a long-running and beloved series at BioWare, but it wasn't always meant to be. Former executive producer Mark Darrah, who worked for BioWare from 1998 through 2022, said that the game was conceived as a standalone story, and that you can still see that intent in some unresolved story threads.</p><p>"Dragon Age: Origins originally was intended as a standalone game," Darrah told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">MrMattyPlays</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-wasnt-meant-to-be-a-series-says-former-bioware-executive-producer-and-thats-why-origins-was-full-of-storylines-that-had-to-be-abandoned/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "You can see this, if you play Dragon Age: Origins, knowing that it was intended to stand alone. There's a lot of threads that are cast out that kind of had to be abandoned because there could be werewolves all over the world, there might be a civil war happening underground in Orzammar." He said those elements were good for world-building but were difficult to deal with as an ongoing series.</p><p>Dragon Age became known as BioWare's fantasy series alongside the sci-fi Mass Effect. Both had ongoing stories that respected your earlier choices, including the ability to import your saves from Dragon Age: Origins and Dragon Age 2 into the third game, Dragon Age: Inquisition. Or, you could customize a set of pre-set choices to build the world of Thedas to your liking. But accounting for all those choices in the third game meant that they could only be so impactful while still telling new original stories, because the studio hadn't counted on needing to pay off every decision from Origins into later games. Then Origins was a success, and the company was inclined to iterate with sequels.</p><p>"It's pretty much financial reasons more than anything," says Darrah. "And I think that the franchise has been much more forward-looking ever since then."</p><p>The latest game in the series, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, had limited connections to previous games in the series, and didn't import saves from previous games or otherwise take your choices into account. It was mostly a standalone story, rather than one that accounted for all your previous adventures in Thedas. Darrah said that EA has pushed for Dragon Age to become more of a mainstream series.</p><p>"The problem that Dragon Age has had, charitably I guess, is that EA wants mainstream success," Darrah said, "and it's hard, or at least it has historically been hard, for corporate people, people who come from the sports side of the organization to look at a game like Dragon Age: Origins, which is super nerdy, not very attractive looking, and say 'Oh, this is a mainstream game.' They don't see it."</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was generally well-received, with an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aggregate score of 82 on Metacritic</a> and our own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">GameSpot review calling it a return to form</a>. But the discourse online has been divisive, with some fans expressing disappointment with the lack of narrative choices and narrowly designed world.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly five years into the lifespan of the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles, many live-service games still support the previous generation's Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but the number is always at risk of dropping. Today, Krafton announced it would be the next developer to end support for those last-gen consoles, as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will no longer be supported on Xbox One and PS4 beginning November 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox One and PS4 support for PUBG will be shut off "during live server maintenance on November 13, 2025," according to the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow ">announcement post on PUBG's official website</a>. The server maintenance will also make enhancements to the current-gen versions, including upgraded resolution and frame-rate options.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549301"></a><figcaption>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years," the announcement post reads. "This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console. We kindly ask for your understanding."</p><p dir="ltr">The post also says that PUBG will no longer be downloadable or playable on the older systems, but that all progress made will be saved and carried over to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. PlayStation players will have to download and install the PS5-specific version of PUBG to play, while Xbox players will automatically upgrade to the Series X|S version via the Smart Delivery feature.</p><p dir="ltr">"The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience," the post explains. "In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly."</p><p dir="ltr">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds can be downloaded for free on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation, and PC.</p>
