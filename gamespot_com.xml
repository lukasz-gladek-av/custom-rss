                <p>Merlin Entertainments has announced a new partnership with Mojang Studios to "bring Minecraft adventures to life" with rides and attractions across the world.</p><p>Merlin is spending more than $110 million on this deal, which the company says will lead to "immersive and interactive entertainment attractions in fixed locations around the globe."</p><p>The press release was light on official details, but it did mention how the deal also covers the development of real-world "touchpoints" that people can access to unlock in-game content.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tShQkO4m6Vs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tShQkO4m6Vs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The initial $110 million investment covers two attractions, one each for the US and the UK; they are set to open in either 2026 or 2027 at unspecified locations. "This will include the development of first-of-its-kind concepts for Minecraft-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage, alongside exciting experiences--including a Minecraft-themed ride--at Merlin locations in these two countries. Longer-term, Merlin will expand these experiences to other destinations globally," the company said.</p><p>Merlin runs the Legoland theme parks, as well as theme parks in the UK, Italy, and Germany, including Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort. Merlin also operates what it calls "Gateway" attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life, and attractions themed around brands like Peppa Pig and Shrek.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402007" data-ratio="0.58067831449126" data-width="1946" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402007"></a><figcaption>A rendering of what a Minecraft attraction could look like</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402008,1300-4402009" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png"></figure><p>Merlin's Magic Making team is working with Mojang to try to "ensure authenticity" for the Minecraft rides and attractions that it creates.

                <p dir="ltr">Sony, parent company of PlayStation, is reportedly in discussions to purchase Kadokawa, parent company of Elden Ring maker From Software. The two companies have been talking, and it's apparently possible an acquisition could be announced in the weeks ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, a possible acquisition would see Sony own the rights to Elden Ring and future games from From Software, also known for Demon Souls (already owned by Sony) and Dark Souls (controlled by publisher Bandai Namco). Acquire, behind Tenchu, and Spike Chunsoft, behind Danganronpa, also sit under <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/business/game.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kadokawa's umbrella</a> and presumably would be part of any merger. Sony already owns a 2% stake in the company.</p><p dir="ltr">Kadokawa's portfolio doesn't just include gaming, though. The company also has a hand in anime and manga, behind franchises like Re:Zero and Delicious in Dungeon. In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-worth-1-175-billion/1100-6494979/" data-ref-id="1100-6494979">Sony acquired anime streaming service

                <p>Rebirth Island has been removed from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> playlist due to "map-specific issues," just hours after the popular map returned. Players are waiting on further updates from Treyarch to find out when the map is likely to be returned to rotation.</p><p>It's a busy time for Warzone, after its big integration with Black Ops 6 and Season 1 launch last week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-anti-cheat-and-weapon-changes/2900-5947/" data-ref-id="2900-5947">The update</a> brought Black Ops 6 operators, weapons, and even game features to Warzone, as well as the new Area 99 Resurgence map, however the integration hasn't been without its hiccups. Players have experienced issues, especially with game audio, as well as with performance on PC.</p><p>Players might have been looking forward to playing the popular Rebirth Island map when it was re-added to Warzone with this week's playlist refresh, but the map was pulled from rotation just over three hours after it was added.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <br>We've removed Rebirth Island from the playlist while we investigate map-specific issues. Other maps and modes remain unaffected.<br>We will post updates here when we have more to share.</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Treyarch has said that the issue in question is map-specific, and that "other maps and modes remain unaffected." The post said further updates would be posted to the same account, but it's currently unclear how quickly the issue is likely to be addressed.</p><p>The Warzone developer has already been hard at work patching issues associated with the Season 1 launch, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-detail-several-fixes-return-of-nuketown-24-7/1100-6527802/" data-ref-id="1100-6527802">the first patch</a> coming the day after the season started. Other posts on the CoD Updates X (formerly Twitter) account show that the team has already resolved a number of issues, so hopefully players will be able to jump back into Rebirth Island soon--but for now, they'll have to stick to exploring Area 99.</p>

                <p>The shojo-anime-tinged farming game Fields of Mistria is getting its first major content patch. It includes a new seasonal festival, mounts--including unicorns, llamas, cows, and sheep--and expanded romance routes.</p><p>The updates includes the "Shooting Star Festival," which takes place in-game on Summer 28. Romancable NPCs can be invited to stargaze if you have four or more hearts with them. As for other town-related additions, the renown level cap has been raised to 70, and you'll receive new rewards and new "Crown Requests" after level 50. You can buy more items at Merri's, Vera's, and Louis's market stalls. You can claim new sets and rewards at the museum for the Insect, Archaeology, and Fish wings.</p><p>After repairing Hayden's barn, you can ride mounts (and you'll unlock a set of relevant skills to boot). Skill caps across the board have been raised from 30 to 45. You can also encounter two new monsters in the mines--the Essence Bat and the Mimic--and pick up new rare cosmetic items from them.</p><p>In romance and relationships, you can now raise your affection with romancable NPCs to six hearts. When you do so, you'll unlock new events with them. Additional NPC dialogue has also been added.</p><p>According to the game's roadmap, future updates will include even more festivals, skill and level cap raises, and marriage.
