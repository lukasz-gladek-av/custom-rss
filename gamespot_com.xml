                <p>A new Elusive Target mission will go live soon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-3/">Hitman: World of Assassination</a>, and this time, Agent 47 will be teaming up with the legendary martial artist Bruce Lee to take down his mark. The Infiltrator Elusive Target mission will activate on September 25 and it runs through November 20.</p><p>This event will see Agent 47 infiltrate a secretive martial arts tournament run by a criminal syndicate at the Himmapan Hotel in Bangkok. Bruce Lee stars as Agent Lee, an operative aiming to win the entire tournament and uncover the identity of the Concord Union's supreme leader. While Lee is busy throwing hands and feet, Agent 47 will be tasked with identifying and neutralizing any threats targeting his ally.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pw3G5cD0aig" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Pw3G5cD0aig" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside this new contract, IO Interactive will also offer a Bruce Lee-themed DLC pack for the duration of the event. Priced at $5, this will offer permanent access to the Elusive Target level, Lee's signature yellow tracksuit from Game of Death as a new cosmetic item, a set of four cosmetics for the Freelancer safehouse, and weapons like kali sticks, a jade dagger, and the Golden Dragon scissors.</p><p>This mission will also mark the start of Season of the Dragon in Hitman: World of Assassination. IO Interactive says that players can expect two new challenges, two Featured Contracts batches, as well as four returning Elusive Targets. A free VR update for all players who own the Steam version of Hitman: World of Assassination has also gone live, and if you haven't tried it out yet, a new PS5 collection dubbed the <a href="https://sovrn.co/1e67m2j" rel="nofollow ">Hitman: World of Assassination Anniversary Edition</a> launches on October 17.</p><p>While IO Interactive is still keeping Hitman active, the studio is also hard at work on its James Bond-simulator, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/">007: First Light</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/">Following a gameplay reveal earlier this month</a>, more details on the game have surfaced ahead of its release on March 27, 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-some-of-the-biggest-levels-that-hitman-dev-has-ever-built/1100-6534477/">The game will feature some of the biggest levels</a> that the Hitman developer has ever built, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-developer-sets-its-sights-on-delivering-better-gunplay-than-hitman/1100-6534854/">as well as gunplay</a> that aims to make you feel like you're trading bullets in a James Bond movie.</p>

                <p>On the opening night of Gamescom last month, Capcom and Square Enix revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> collaboration that will touch the worlds of both games. Now, Capcom has revealed that its side of the crossover is starting Monday, September 29 with the arrival of its Free Title Update 3. That news came with a fresh trailer that shows off what happens when the worlds of Monster Hunter Wilds and Final Fantasy 14 collide.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ca1iBhq-C90" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ca1iBhq-C90" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As seen in the trailer, FF14's Omega Planetes has found a way into the Monster Hunter world, and it's going to take some teamwork to defeat this mechanical monstrosity. To combat Omega Planetes, two new FF14 jobs are being introduced in Wilds: Dark Knight and Pictomancer. The former gives players Dark Knight-themed armor that can create damage-absorbing barriers and push back against heavy attacks. Pictomancers essentially create images that unleash powerful spells against their enemies.</p><p>Several Final Fantasy 14-inspired cosmetics will be unlockable in this update, including a Chocobo seikret skin and new gestures. The trailer also teases December's Free Title Update 4, which will feature the return of Gogmazios, an elder dragon who hasn't been huntable in the game since Monster Hunters 4 Ultimate in 2015. </p><p>Although Capcom recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-patch-notes-new-update-adds-tougher-endgame-content-weapon-changes-more/1100-6533861/">new patch for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, the PC port's optimization issues won't be directly addressed by Free Title Update 3. Capcom has previously stated that those issues will be the focus of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update coming this winter</a>, which doesn't currently have a date tied to it.</p>
