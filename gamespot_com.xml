                <p>Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney apparently attended a high-profile lunch today, May 13, in Saudi Arabia with US President Donald Trump and other world and business leaders from across the globe.</p><p>This is according to a list of attendees supplied by the White House and <a href="https://x.com/kaitlancollins/status/1922207622670802974?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared by reporter Kaitlan Collins.</a> Some of the other attendees include Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller, just to name a few.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was said to have attended the lunch as well. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/05/13/us/trump-news-saudi-arabia" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times reported</a> that the high-profile executives might have been there to make business deals or lobby Trump and his own officials on tariffs and trade policies in general.</p><p>Sweeney was the only video game executive on the list of attendees, though. Saudi Arabi's Public Investment Fund has invested tens of billions into the gaming market in recent years, which has prompted some concern from people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-studio-owner-embracer-defends-decision-to-take-1-billion-from-saudi-arabia/1100-6504587/" data-ref-id="1100-6504587">dismayed by the nation's human rights history.</a></p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Epic Games in an attempt to get more details on Sweeney's reported involvement in this lunch.</p><p>For its part, Chinese internet behemoth Tencent is a minority investor in the company. In 2024, two directors at Epic who had been appointed by Tencent <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">resigned from the Epic board</a> following a US government investigation.</p><p>Sweeney's Epic Games recently scored a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">key victory in its fight against Apple</a>, but Fortnite hasn't yet returned to the App Store. As of May 13, Apple is <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1922217841031336279" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still reviewing Fortnite for release.</a></p>

The game has a distinctly French vibe to it--thanks to it being visually influenced by France's Belle √âpoque art movement--but early in its development, Expedition 33 was originally set in a steampunk world that was populated with supernatural enemies.</p><p>"This game was very different. The gameplay would have been similar, but the story was completely different. It was set in a steampunk Victorian England with zombies, aliens, and various things," narrative lead Jennifer Svedberg-Yen explained to <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-narrative-lead-jennifer-svedberg-yen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Becoming A Parry Master In Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 In 13 Minutes</p>
      </div>
<p>After Expedition 33's investors encouraged developer Sandfall Interactive to think bigger, this led to the game being rebooted entirely. The studio had been working on Expedition 33 for six months at this point, and the new direction was inspired by a painting that game director Guillaume Broche liked and a short story with artistic themes that Svedberg-Yen had written.</p><p>The final spark for Expedition 33's new direction was Guillaume's mother, who helped provide the "catalyst" for the story. From there, all the pieces fell into place as Expedition 33's crew polished the story and recruited an all-star cast of actors to voice the game's characters. While the game does leave some room open for a potential sequel, Svedberg-Yen added that Sandfall Interactive is now focused on fine-tuning Expedition 33 and addressing any bugs. That doesn't mean that the studio isn't thinking about producing new content, but "it's probably not going to be for a while" Svedberg-Yen said.</p><p>Sandfall Interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-new-patch-nerfs-the-strongest-party-member/1100-6531420/">recently dropped a patch that addresses several issues in the game</a>.
