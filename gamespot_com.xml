                <p dir="ltr">EA and Maxis are finally giving <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> a burglar of its own in a new update that's live on all platforms. The Sims 4's burglar update coincides with the launch of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-businesses-hobbies-expansion-adds-tattoo-artist-career-and-ceramic-incense-burners/1100-6529300/" data-ref-id="1100-6529300">Businesses and Hobbies expansion</a>, though you don't have to buy the new pack to get the burglar. It's a free update for the base game with special interactions if you own certain other expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Maxis included a burglar in The Sims, The Sims 2, and The Sims 3, but never in The Sims 4 until now. Robin Banks, the new version of the criminal mastermind, behaves in much the same way as the burglar in previous iterations. There's a low chance that Robin will enter your residential or business lot at night, and she can potentially make off with anything inside that isn't attached to the structure, such as windows or lights, or that isn't planted in the ground, like your shrubbery. The update also adds a new lot challenge, Heist Havoc, that increases the likelihood of Robin appearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Sims might wake up, catch Robin, and call the police before she makes off with their property, though there's no guarantee the police will arrive before Robin makes her getaway. Maxis said the only sure way to stop a burglar is to install an alarm, which alerts police as soon as Robin enters the premises. Sims who are good with their hands can upgrade their alarm to keep it from breaking as frequently or even modify it to release an electric charge and stun the burglar. If your Sim is more physically inclined, they can also pick a fight with Robin, though they might lose if they aren't in good shape.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_wnGkiBOtM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_wnGkiBOtM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">A handful of other Sims 4 expansions include unique interactions for the burglar. For example, if you own the Cats and Dogs pack and have a dog in your house, they might chase Robin out. Vampire Sims can turn Robin into a thrall and command her to leave, while scientists from the Get to Work pack can use a freeze ray to stop Robin. Non-playable Sims, such as Agnes Crumplebottom in the Cottage Living pack, will have their own methods for dealing with Robin.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Maxis said The Sims 4 treats Robin like other special NPCs. You can make friends with her and add her to your household, and if she moves in with you or dies, another, generic burglar will spawn and take up her criminal mantle.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stars-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-634584">Stars Reach</a>, a new sci-fi MMO seeking funding on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/starsreach/stars-reach/description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter</a>, has blown past its initial funding goal of $200,000 in less than an hour of being live.</p><p dir="ltr">No doubt the pedigree behind Stars Reach is part of the reason for that. The game is coming from studio Playable Worlds, led by Raph Koster, one of the lead creators of MMO classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ultima-online/" data-ref-id="5000-2222">Ultima Online</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-galaxies-the-complete-online-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-27644">Star Wars Galaxies</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRd5xiNfCg0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZRd5xiNfCg0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Stars Reach is putting a heavy emphasis on its sandbox nature, giving players the freedom to shape its galaxy how they see fit. That means it's up to players to terraform planets, build settlements, form trade empires, genetically engineer alien creatures, or wipe entire planets off the map. The game's universe is procedurally generated, and players will have the ability to shape it to their liking.</p><p dir="ltr">It all sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/no-mans-sky/" data-ref-id="5000-221687">No Man's Sky</a>, albeit with far more players. There will be spaceships and action-based combat, but much like the more free-form Star Wars Galaxies from which Stars Reach is taking heavy inspiration, combat doesn't sound like the game's focus. There will be dozens of professions to choose from, some ideal for combat, but many that aren't. Its "endgame" sounds like it's whatever players want it to be, whether it be governing a city or exploring the deep reaches of space. It certainly sounds ambitious, with cities and even a planet's ecosystem all falling on the shoulders of players to manage.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike some Kickstarter games that seek funding on little more than concept art and a dream, Stars Reach is said to already be fairly far along, having been in development for several years at this point. There have been playable pre-alpha tests for months now, with the goal being for Stars Reach to launch in early access this summer. A full release is tentatively slated to come in the first half of next year. As stated on the Kickstarter page, seeking public funding "isn't about starting the game--it's about finishing it, expanding it, and bringing this living galaxy to its full potential."</p><p dir="ltr">Those who want to play during early access will need to support the Kickstarter at the $30 tier or purchase an early access supporter pack when those become available. The full game, however, will be free-to-play with optional microtransactions. Like many free-to-play MMOs, there will be an optional monthly subscription as well, though this one will be required for those looking to build homes on the intergalactic frontier. It's called the Property Pass, and along with letting players become landowners, it will also grant access to unique cosmetics and other items.</p><p dir="ltr">In its first Kickstarter update after surpassing its initial goal, Playable Worlds said it was humbled and grateful for the support.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is your victory as much as ours, and we can't wait to take this journey together," Playable Worlds' statement reads. "But the journey isn't over. The more we raise the faster we can bring this game to market. And the better the game will be."</p>

Games said it made the "very difficult" decision to restructure its development teams, resulting in these studio closures. Going forward, Warner Bros. Games said it will focus on four major franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p><p>The statement said the decision to close the three studios was a "strategic change" that had nothing to do with the teams or the talented individuals working there.</p><p>As for the new Wonder Woman game, Warner Bros. said it wanted to make "the highest quality" game, but "unfortunately this is no longer possible within our strategic priorities." Wonder Woman is, of course, a DC property, but it seemingly is not a fit within the company's new strategy.</p><p>"This is another tough decision, as we recognize Monolith's storied history of delivering epic fan experiences through amazing games," the company said.</p><p>WBD gaming boss JB Perrette announced these decisions in a memo to staff today obtained by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/529310/warner-bros-games-monolith-productions-multiversus-studio-closure" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. He said some staff who were not laid off will be reassigned to other internal roles where possible. He also said Warner Bros. will look to do more in the mobile games space and aims to "regain our credibility and swagger at producing great games."
