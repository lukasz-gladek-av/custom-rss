                <p>Ahead of its launch later this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a> has overtaken Hollow Knight: Silksong in order to become the most wishlisted game on Steam.</p><p>This was spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sims-rival-inzoi-has-become-the-most-wishlisted-game-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, who monitored data directly from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=popularwishlist" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and third-party websites like SteamDB. Although Hollow Knight: Silksong technically has more followers on Steam, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/mostwished/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>, that data shows that over 52,000 people have wishlisted InZoi prior to its March 27 launch, skyrocketing its follower total to over 244,000. That's enough to make it display as the most wishlisted game on Steam. The top five is rounded out, in order, by Hollow Knight: Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JANvRG0ehgs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JANvRG0ehgs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>InZoi is a life sim game that clearly draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/as-the-sims-turns-25-ea-wants-to-embrace-the-series-past/2900-6185/" data-ref-id="2900-6185">series like The Sims</a>. Players can create and customize virtual humans called "Zois," before watching them go about their daily lives. When InZoi comes out this Friday, it'll be part of the Steam Early Access program. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">early-access review of InZoi</a> saw potential in what it played, praising its visuals and customizations, but noted that there's still much to improve regarding gameplay.</p><p>InZoi launches into early access on March 27, so it'll lose that most-wishlisted spot soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> still does not have a release date at this time, it seems bound to retake that top slot on Steam's most wishlisted ranking.</p>

                <p>The GTA modder and superfan who goes by the handle Dark Space caught the attention of fans by recently releasing a playable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-of-gta-6s-map-has-been-brought-into-gta-5-by-a-superfan/1100-6529130/" data-ref-id="1100-6529130">recreation of the Grand Theft Auto 6 map in Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. However, he has announced that he has ceased all work on the project after being struck by a takedown from Rockstar owner Take–Two.</p><p>Dark Space created the free-to-download map solely based on the official trailer shots of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> and some unverified leaks, then uploaded gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. GTA fans who have been feeling deprived of any new information about the upcoming game downloaded the modded map off FiveM en masse. That's when he noticed messages from YouTube about his videos being taken down due to a copyright strike. </p><p>In an explanation video, the creator says that Take-Two requested that his videos be removed, resulting in his first copyright strike. Multiple strikes can result in the termination of an entire channel.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7LmLfJAuR_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I've also removed the download link to my mod, even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space said in the video. "I think it's smarter to get in front of them than waiting for their email that will never come. To avoid another copyright strike from Take-Two, I'm not going to use any footage from Grand Theft Auto in this video." He went on to explain how he ended up in this situation, giving a brief history of the modding and map-making community for GTA and how they were trying to guess how big the map was going to be in GTA 6.</p><p>"So why did they remove my video and take away my month's income that I spent two months hard to earn? Well, my guess is that the map is a little too accurate," he continued. "They must feel some sort of threat from it existing because they feel that having a playable version of the map to drive around in could ruin the surprise and newness of GTA 6 when it releases."</p><p>That kind of removal request seemed almost inevitable. Former Rockstar Games technical director Obbe Vermeij recently commented on the frequent takedowns by Take-Two, saying they are "entirely predictable."</p><p dir="ltr">"They will take down mods that interfere with their business interests," he <a href="https://x.com/ObbeVermeij/status/1883238047015149881" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a> back in January. "The VC NextGen Edition mod for GTA4 directly competes with the Definitive Edition. The Liberty City preservation project (GTA4 in GTA5 engine) would interfere with a possible GTA4 remaster. (No idea whether they’re working on that. I think they should.) There’s no point getting angry about it. This is what companies are supposed to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Grand Theft Auto 6 is scheduled to be released this fall on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. There has not been an announcement date for a PC release but that will likely be coming later.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A fun myth to hear about relates to a friend's uncle working at Nintendo to get the scoop on secrets. But what if your buddy's aunt actually did work at Valve, and his CD-burning gifts to you sparked Valve's utilization of DRM decades ago? That's apparently what happened, according to former Valve chief marketing officer Monica Harrington.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a> reports that Harrington told the unlikely Valve DRM origin story featuring her 19-year-old nephew at the Game Developers Conference. "At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue," Harrington said. "My own nephew had just used a $500 check I'd sent him for school expenses and bought himself a CD-ROM replicator, so he sent me a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that CDs were the distribution model for PC games decades ago, before digital storefronts existed. So the fact someone could easily rip a game and share unlimited copies with friends was a threat to companies. As such, Harrington credits her nephew's antics for sparking Valve to act with a DRM strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because of gamers like my nephew, we implemented an authentication scheme," said Harrington. "Customers had to validate and register their copy with Valve directly. Soon gamers were flooding message boards, and they were saying, 'The game doesn't work.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Harrington added that Valve co-founder (and her ex-husband) Mike Harrington remembers it a bit differently, as he believes the company was working on DRM already. But Monica Harrington stresses that she was making a big deal about an authentication system to everyone at Valve after hearing about what her nephew did.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the only story Monica Harrington shared about Valve's early days at GDC. She also discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dramatic-half-life-deal-that-altered-the-fate-of-valve-forever/1100-6530291/">the dramatic Half-Life deal that altered the fate of the company forever</a>. Meanwhile, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-seemingly-bans-all-steam-games-that-require-watching-advertisements-to-play/1100-6529356/">Valve seemingly banned any games that required watching paid advertisements to play</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Valve's digital storefront <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/">Steam broke a new concurrent-players record with over 41.2 million users</a>.</p>

                <p>A Nintendo Direct is reportedly set to air sometime this week, right before the scheduled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on April 2</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1904275415075606643?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">insider NateTheHate2</a>, the Direct will be on or around Thursday, but but he is not sure if it will be formatted like a traditional Nintendo Direct or something like an Indie World Showcase.

Not everyone will be early adopters of Switch 2, and analysts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-wont-sell-as-well-as-original-due-in-part-to-backward-compatibility-analyst/1100-6530136/" data-ref-id="1100-6530136">predict that it won't sell as well as its predecessor</a>. Having two separate Directs lets Nintendo focus entirely on its upcoming system during its April 2 show.</p><p>As for what Nintendo could show in the rumored Direct this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is a possibility.
