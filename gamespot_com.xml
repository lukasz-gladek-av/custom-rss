                <p>Rockstar Games has released a new statement regarding the situation surrounding the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862"> fired workers in the UK and internationally</a>, once again claiming the 30+ staffers were let go not because they were trying to form a union, but because they were breaching company policy.</p><p>Specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that the action was taken against the workers because they were discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. </p><p>Rockstar said this was "in breach of company policy and their legal obligations."</p><p>The fired staffers and a union seeking to represent them said the Rockstar workers were fired for their efforts to establish a union. Rockstar pushed back, telling GameSpot, "Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p><p>This is what Rockstar has been saying since the firings happened in October. At the time the action came to light, Rockstar said the workers were let go <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">"for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</a> In November, Rockstar the firings were in "no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">Rockstar is guilty of</a> "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-deflecting-after-claiming-fired-union-workers-leaked-information?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IWGB told Game Developer</a> that Rockstar developers in the UK have a "statutory right to engage in private conversation with union organizers that supersedes any employment contract."</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>The situation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">escalated all the way to the UK Prime Minister</a>. Keir Starmer recently said it was a "deeply concerning case," making the point that every worker has the right to join a union. He added, "We're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union."</p><p>A subsequent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar fired the devs over messages on Discord</a> about the company's revised internal Slack policies. Over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-200-rockstar-devs-sign-letter-demanding-fired-staff-be-reinstated/1100-6536181/" data-ref-id="1100-6536181">200 Rockstar employees have demanded</a> that the fired devs be reinstated, and there have been multiple protests at Rockstar offices in support of the workers. For now, the issue remains unresolved.</p><p>Rockstar's current big project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, which is set for release in November 2026. The company recently launched a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-new-modern-upgrade-shown-off-in-first-gameplay-footage/1100-6536618/" data-ref-id="1100-6536618">new version of Red Dead Redemption for modern consoles and mobile</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">new-generation ports of Red Dead Redemption 2</a> are said to be in the works as well. </p>

                <p>As it's routinely done with previous games in the series, The Pokemon Company is giving away a variety of freebies for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>. These in-game goodies range from helpful items to elusive Mega Stones that can't otherwise be acquired, making it worthwhile to snag them while you can.</p><p>Most of the free items can be downloaded via Mystery Gift, a function that you'll automatically unlock after the first time you speak with Mable at the Pokemon Research Lab, roughly one hour into the adventure. However, the freebies are typically only available for a limited time, so you'll want to claim them as soon as possible.</p><p>Here's a roundup of all the free Mystery Gifts available right now for Pokemon Legends: Z-A, along with instructions on how to claim each of them.

                <p>The wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> has been long, and fans are eager for any sign of progress--and don't expect any sort of announcement this holiday season. However, that excitement only grew when Bethesda released a live-action comedy trailer to celebrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/1100-65360/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">Skyrim's sudden launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The trailer features a mischievous Santa and two elves, and at first glance, it seems like simple holiday fun. But the numbers shown on the elves' character screen quickly caught the community's attention.</p><p>The reason: One elf's speech skill jumps to 27, while their overall level is shown moving toward 20. Some fans believe these numbers are a deliberate hint that The Elder Scrolls 6 is planned for 2027. Supporters of the theory argue that the numbers are too specific to be random, while others think people may be reading too much into a random number. Still, because Bethesda rarely shares direct updates about the game, even small details like this can spark big debates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nHxhOQsSj6E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This honestly might be the best piece of evidence we have for a release date," one fan said. "Those are very specific numbers, and I don't think they would use those numbers by accident."</p><p>There's good reason for both curiosity and caution. Bethesda leaders, including Todd Howard, have repeatedly said the game is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"a long way off,"</a> even though it was first announced back in 2018. The studio has confirmed that early development began in 2023 and that playtesting is now underway, but no release window has been announced. Fans feel the long gap more sharply because Skyrim's re-releases kept the series in the spotlight while the next main entry remained out of reach.</p><p>Howard has admitted the wait has been unusually long, though he says the team needed a creative break and wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">build Starfield first</a>. He's also expressed interest in surprising fans with a sudden release, similar to the shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered in 2025</a>. Whether or not the numbers in the Switch 2 trailer actually point to 2027, anticipation for The Elder Scrolls 6 is only growing.</p><p>Bethesda might have its hands full going into 2026 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrims-switch-2-port-has-a-bit-of-a-performance-issue/1100-6536879/" data-ref-id="1100-6536879">Switch 2 port marred with lag issues</a> and the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition still awaiting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well</a>.</p>

                <p>For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/" data-ref-id="2900-5031">US's top-selling games of the year</a>. But it looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-to-change-release-strategy-for-call-of-duty-franchise-as-new-data-suggests-player-count-has-halved-in-12-months" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline.</p><p>Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam.</p><p>"The data points to a foundational engagement challenge for Black Ops 7," reads a statement from Video Game Insights. "Whether the cause lies in franchise fatigue, shifting genre preferences, competition from other titles, or a misalignment with player expectations, the early indicators are clear: this is not a normal launch-cycle fluctuation. It is a significant departure from historical performance."</p><p>Earlier this week, Activision itself acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. That was soon followed by an announcement from Microsoft that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call Of Duty was 2025's top franchise on Game Pass</a>. Both of those things can be true, but it remains to be seen whether the decline in standalone sales is being made offset by Game Pass or other factors.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision haven't shared their Call of Duty plans for 2026 yet. The one thing we do know from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's recent dispatch</a> is that there won't be any more Modern Warfare or Black Ops sequels dropping in consecutive years.</p>
