                <p>Streaming platform Twitch has announced a big change to its monetization policy, as "most streamers" will soon gain access to the site's monetization tools. Previously, only Twitch affiliates and partners could access these revenue-generating tool, but these will be available to more creators later in 2025.</p><p>"We want you to be able to take advantage of our monetization tools, whether you're just getting your community started, or have been on Twitch for a while," Twitch CEO Dan Clancy wrote in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2025/02/27/what-s-next-in-2025-an-open-letter-from-twitch-ceo-dan-clancy/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We're excited to open up monetization tools--subscriptions and bits--to most streamers, from day one. This will allow creators, regardless of their status, to grow their communities and start building earnings through direct patronage. We're also introducing an option, which will allow all streamers to use their earnings on purchases within Twitch."</p><p>Previously, earning a Twitch partnership required a user to have 50 followers, an average of three viewers per stream, and at least eight hours of cumulative streaming across at least seven different days. That process could be daunting for new streamers given the competitive nature of Twitch, but it was generally achievable if a person was consistent with their efforts.</p><p>Beyond this big change, Clancy also explained other plans for Twitch in 2025. The company is working on features to help partners earn more money while collaborating, both landscape and vertical video through enhanced broadcasting tools will be added to improve the mobile viewing experience, and the tools to edit clips will also be improved. These updates come shortly after <a href="https://x.com/TwitchSupport/status/1892277199497043994" rel="nofollow ">Twitch announced that it'll be implementing a 100-hour storage cap</a> on highlights and uploads starting April 19, a move that has not gone over well with a large part of its userbase.</p><p>While the company cites a need to save on storage costs and video highlights not being as popular as it envisioned as reasons behind the move, users have noted that Twitch's parent company Amazon is one of the biggest names in cloud storage, leading to criticism of the cost-cutting measure.</p>

                <p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the biggest sports game ever in the US according to Circana, and it seems that the publisher is considering bringing back its take on college basketball, which has been dormant for more than a decade. In a recent report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/">The Athletic</a>, EA Sports senior vice president Daryl Holt said that college basketball (and other sports) remain a possibility, but reiterated that American football is still the publisher's main priority.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was a clear need, want, desire from our community and the faithful were there [for college football]," Holt said. “As developers, we try to figure out how we can get creative on reaching other aspects of sports, whether that be a smaller sport or one that doesn't have a game. But right now, my focus has been on American football. We'll keep looking for those things, but as a developer and working in sports, you're always tapping your head going, what else could be possible?”</p><p dir="ltr">The last EA Sports-published NCAA basketball game, NCAA Basketball 10, came out in 2009 and featured the now-retired dunk contest champ Blake Griffin as the cover athlete. While any plans for a new college basketball game remain quite nascent, it's likely that EA would try to get as many student athletes as possible to sign to a name, image, and likeness (NIL) deal. More than 11,000 FBS football players opted into CFB 25's deal last year, receiving $600 and a copy of the game as compensation for their NIL rights. The NIL deal for CFB 26 is reportedly still being negotiated, though EA declined to comment on those plans. The CFB series itself lay dormant for more than a decade, the last release coming in 2012 before last year's revival restored its fortunes.</p><p dir="ltr">Holt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-new-college-football-26-features/1100-6529751/">teased new features</a> coming to this year's sequel, CFB 26, including possible improvements to the single-player career mode Road to Glory. CFB 25 was the second-best selling game of 2024 in the US, second only to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>
