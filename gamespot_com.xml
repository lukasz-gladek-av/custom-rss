                <p dir="ltr">Real, lived experiences are some of the strongest influences in art.</p><p dir="ltr">It's AAPI Heritage Month--an annual reminder that Asian and Pacific Islander influences are worth celebrating. AAPI doesn't just include East Asian cultures like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, but a wide range of racial and ethnic groups including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-games-are-lagging-behind-in-south-asian-representation/1100-6503195/">South Asian</a> and Native Hawaiian. As a Filipino-American, I also fall under the AAPI umbrella.</p><p dir="ltr">While the term helps rally support and advocacy behind a large chunk of racial and ethnic groups, it can be difficult to define because of that broadness. Those who identify as AAPI often have the perspective of growing up abroad and either coming from a different country or being born to immigrant parents. That opens the door to a unique experience full of its own pros and cons, not quite fitting in with the people from your ethnic group but also not quite fitting in with the foreign culture your family is trying to assimilate into.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an experience that isn't easy to explain in just a few words, though some games manage to get the message across in impactful, meaningful ways. In the past few years, we've enjoyed games from AAPI developers such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/venba-review-tourist-to-your-own-culture/1900-6418096/">Venba</a>, 1000xResist, and Butterfly Soup--and those are just the start. Some of these games have AAPI developers directly at the helm and even sometimes feature stories about first- and second-generation AAPI characters.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of that, games like A Space From The Unbound from Indonesia and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-until-then-showcases-the-beauty-of-filipino-culture/1100-6523531/">Until Then</a> from the Philippines are helping to round out East Asian-heavy representation of the cultures underneath the AAPI umbrella, even if they aren't created by Asians overseas. Both types of games give us powerful narratives to relate to and prove how even those who can't personally relate to AAPI heritage can appreciate other cultures and the depth they bring to a story.</p><p dir="ltr">To celebrate AAPI month, GameSpot gathered thoughts from AAPI developers and professionals in the gaming industry about what AAPI month means to them and how their identity has shaped their work:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389" data-ratio="0.56217162872154" data-width="1713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503389"></a><figcaption>1000xResist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503389-1000-resist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Our whole mission with 1000xRESIST was to see ourselves, and Asian diasporic stories, in-game and on screen, portrayed with dignity. To realize our desire for these stories to be told in ambitious and experimental ways, that held space for dreaming, yearning, and searching. Our identity and lived experiences are such a huge part of the work we make, and we try to lean into the specific as much as possible. This month really reminds me of the kinds of sacrifices the previous generation made, under hostility and discrimination. I don't want to take that for granted, and I want to fight to continue to tell these stories, especially with and for other AAPI creators." -- <strong>Remy Sin, Creative Director of 1000xResist</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"AAPI Month has, in the past, left me feeling a bit complicated as someone who is half Korean and--especially growing up--was unsure how I fit into the celebrations as someone 'in-between.' The ways that games have typically interpreted and portrayed 'Asians' as a monolith honestly didn't help much either. What has helped is media--by AAPI developers--that's highlighted the variations, range, and richness of the Asian-American experience. As cheesy as it sounds, games (like <a href="https://emmkid.itch.io/half" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Half</a>, 1000xRESIST, Venba, Butterfly Soup 2) have helped me explore my bi-racial, second-generation identity, and I hope we continue to see more." -- <strong>Jenny Windom, Communications Director, Ivy Road; Co-Owner, Soft Not Weak; Organizer/Host, Wholesome Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Truth be told, AAPI month always felt like a tricky one. You see, most of my life, it always felt like being of Indian descent didn't qualify as 'Asian.' Which is utterly ridiculous because the country is literally in Asia! But even more importantly: 'Asian' celebrations and media usually didn't include people of darker skin tones. I was different but not the 'right kind' of different. The stereotypes and racist remarks that my community was subject to were of violence and filth. On a positive note, though, I do think that diversity culture is slowly changing. I am seeing more people who look like me, with actual personalities, being portrayed on screen. Hey, I even got to write my thoughts for AAPI month on GameSpot, ha!" -- <strong>Neha Patel, Composer/Sound Designer</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There is so much to AAPI heritage, but at the end of the day I'm grateful for the sense of camaraderie and joy we can find in each other. Everything I do now is influenced by the support I was surrounded by in my culture. And as we continue to tell our stories, I hope we see more variety in AAPI developers, aesthetics, and themes." -- <strong>Victoria Tran, Communications Director at Innersloth</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393" data-ratio="0.56222547584187" data-width="1366" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503393"></a><figcaption>Butterfly Soup</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1624/16240817/4503393-butterfly-soup.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Every project I've worked on contains a small reflection of my Filipino-American identity in hopes that those who interact with it may see a piece of themselves in it, too. Representation is endlessly impactful, especially in an immersive medium like video games. It welcomes more people to feel a sense of belonging, allowing our imagined worlds to reflect the diverse one we live in today. AAPI Heritage Month is always a lovely reminder of how much pride we all have in our unique cultures and how important it is to celebrate and embrace it within our industry!" -- <strong>Belinda Garcia-Maguid, Game Writer and Narrative Designer at Crystal Dynamics</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Three years ago, I met an Asian-American narrative designer for the first time and realized I could also become one. Meeting her broke an imaginary boundary I didn't know I drew between my creative and professional identities, and I remember asking her what it was like being the only AAPI writer on her team. She just shrugged, and said when I joined the industry, there'd be at least two of us. Now, as an early career developer, I'm reminded how representation demonstrates to aspiring AAPI developers that they have a place in games to exist and thrive. Even as the industry struggles, I'm still excited for the day when I can say: 'Well, there's at least three of us.'" -- <strong>Anne Zhang-Huang, Associate Narrative Designer at Zenimax Online Studios</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"My game is set in Ontario in 1914, and I knew that I would be including a Japanese-Canadian character to honour my family heritage. The first wave of Japanese immigrants to Canada started around 1877. My grandmother on my father's side was born in Vancouver in 1912. Representation in our media is so important because historically this representation hasn't been common--d – Despite the fact that diverse populations were and are the reality, more often than not." -- <strong>Julia Minamata, Solo Indie Game Developer of The Crimson Diamond</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"The rising tide of AAPI representation lately fills me with so much pride. In Everything Everywhere All At Once, I saw my mother: from her sensible shoes and puffer vest to her toiling in a mom-and-pop laundromat. In the rise of K-pop, I see people who look like me held up as aspirational figures, influencing generations worldwide in the way they look and dress. I didn't have this growing up, though being born and raised in Los Angeles meant that I never felt like a minority (even though I was, in a numerical sense). In my own work, I'm proud to express my diverse viewpoints with my love of character and emotional conflicts; things that don't scream 'the Asian experience' at the forefront, and yet are made up of references from how I grew up and the traits I value. I love AAPI Heritage Month as a beautiful celebration to highlight all the different voices that make our worlds, both real and fictional, all the more interesting." -- <strong>Karrie Shao, Lead Narrative Designer &amp; Lead Writer of Pacific Drive</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503394"></a><figcaption>Pacific Drive</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503394-pacific-drive.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I've lived in the US as a US citizen for 85% of my life and I'm still wondering how long I have to live here to be accepted as an American. As a kid, I assumed things would get better as time went on and never did I think back then attitudes would start going backwards. It's true, if we look back at where racial acceptance was 50 or a 100 years ago, things have gotten better but in my life and where we are, it certainly doesn't feel that way. I see some changes and want a bright future for my teen sons as they navigate their way to adulthood but at the same time I worry. That worry might be just how every parent is with generational divides and the idea of loss and the idea that we won't be around to see our kids' story play out fully into their lives.</p><p dir="ltr">"What I like for them to remember is that their differences in their mixed Asian heritage is what makes them unique and instead of shying away from it like I did as a new immigrant kid learning English for the first time., I want them to own it and be proud of it. It's easier said than done but I have hope. The reason we still (for now) recognize AAPI and other non-dominant cultures is because it's important to understand that the US is a land of diversity and a land of immigrants. People in power tend to forget that this country was not theirs but it was taken by bloody conflict and by force. Dominant culture likes to simplify and establish a very narrow set of rules of what it means to be an American but we know it's more nuanced than that. It's why stories and sharing experiences are important and why we and our studio focuses on games about underrepresented cultures and themes. I'm hopeful, cautiously hopeful and I know I've got to do my part in creating interesting experiences to keep pushing the idea of the variety of people that make up this country." -- <strong>Chandana Ekanayake, Creative Director at Outerloop Games</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"We've made a lot of strides in representation when it comes to video games. Institutions may not be there yet, but I do believe players are! The love and support our game has gotten stands as testament to that. However, video games are a truly global medium. Too often, discussion of representation is limited to works from the diaspora in the West. I would like to see the industry as a whole make more of an effort to pay attention to and support works from underrepresented regions, too. There is a growing game development scene in South Asia that I'm personally very excited about, and I would love all inclusion efforts to reach farther than the Western-centric approach we default to." -- <strong>Abhi, Creative Director and Founder of Visai Games</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503391"></a><figcaption>Venba</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4503391-venba.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month is a time of reflection of our immigrant histories, arts, and the unevenly experienced socioeconomic and civic participation. Although there have been brilliant titles in recent years that highlight the unique challenges faced by the Asian diaspora, we devs have more work ahead of us to highlight that Asian experiences aren't interchangeable and monolithic to both the industry and the public. Just as the census has increased ethnic origin specificity (such as including Hong Kong in the 2021 Canadian census), games deserve representation that reflects the complexity of our cultural and civic preoccupations." -- <strong>Tanya Kan, Executive Producer and Director at Vivid Foundry</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"There was a time I provided cultural consultation on a past title. I remember being shown concept art for the villain who was supposed to be an older man. In one of the iterations, he was wearing a taqiyah, which is a prayer cap worn by men in many different countries around the world who follow Islam. I expressed concern over that specific choice because it belongs to a group of minorities who are rarely represented to begin with. I felt having a practicing Muslim man portrayed as the 'bad guy' could send the wrong message and be seen as disrespectful to those who follow Islam. The artist thanked me for the insight and went in a different direction as a result. While there is a wealth of knowledge that we can find online, there is nothing that beats lived experience when it comes to cultural nuances and making sure all minorities are represented correctly and respectfully." -- <strong>Neha Nair, Campaign Marketing Manager at The New Blank</strong></p><p dir="ltr">"Games inspire. They inspire players to face challenges creatively; to explore endlessly; to see themselves in unexpected reflections. They inspire gamemakers to design for different minds; to imagine bigger, bolder worlds; to respect the audience's most valuable resource of time. For players and developers both, diversity makes the material for inspiration richer. It widens the pool of perspectives to draw from in making games, and broadens the invitation of play to people across all markers of identity.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's the big philosophy, and in practice, my identity has affected my work in treasured ways. It's connected me to fellow devs and players, with precious moments of Pinoy and LGBT pride. It's empowered me to be unafraid in drawing from my own background in what I create. But most importantly, it's made me a stronger, more empathetic, more open-minded observer and listener, who readily welcomes inspiration from others and hopefully inspires others in turn. Happy AAPI Heritage Month and Pride Month! Isang Bagsak!" -- <strong>Isa Mari De Leon, Narrative Writer at Riot Games</strong></p>

                <p>Gearbox Software boss Randy Pitchford continues to speak out regarding the price point of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-price-is-a-mystery-even-to-randy-pitchford/1100-6531437/" data-ref-id="1100-6531437">remains a mystery</a>. Posting on social media, Pitchford said that first and foremost he does not want people to pay "any more than they should or are comfortable with." He's saying this after he controversially said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/real-fans-will-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen-if-borderlands-4-costs-80-says-randy-pitchford/1100-6531677/" data-ref-id="1100-6531677">"real fans"</a> will find a way to find $80 to buy Borderlands 4 if it costs that much.</p><p>"I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1927802548326650365" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he said</a>.</p><p>With his "real fans" comment, Pitchford said he was responding to a person who suggested Borderlands 4 would "fail" at $80.</p><p>"What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn't my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that's obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it's a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it," he said.</p><p>He said he "triggered some people" by using the phrase "real fans," going on to push back against the idea that he was trying to make "some big statement."</p><p>"I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel)," he said.</p><p>Pitchford went on to say that, as an artist, he doesn't want to see price increases because that might limit how many people could play it. At the same time, Pitchford is a businessman and he said he understands that "business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up."</p><p>"Sooner or later we're going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content," he said.</p><p>Speaking at PAX, Pitchford said it's a "gnarly" time in the video game industry when it comes to economics.</p><p>"On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where people who make [pricing] choices want to sell as many units as possible and they want to be careful about people that are price-sensitive," he said. "So there are some folks who don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are. There are other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing and there are tariffs for the retail packaging."</p><p>Borderlands 4 has "more than twice" the development budget of Borderlands 3, Pitchford said, adding that he hopes the game sells as many copies as possible so Gearbox can reinvest those funds into future products.</p><p>2K, the publisher of Borderlands 4, will set the price of Borderlands 4. Exactly what that price will be remains a mystery and may not be confirmed until preorders open.</p><p>Nintendo is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">charging $80 for Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">Microsoft is raising prices to $80 as well</a> for some games later this year. Another 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531409/" data-ref-id="1100-6531409">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, is going to sell for $50 as part of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-isnt-open-world-and-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment/1100-6531408/" data-ref-id="1100-6531408">intentional bid to appeal to players who don't have a lot of free time.</a></p><p>Borderlands 4 releases on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It's coming to Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> as well, but there is no release date yet.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2024/1100-6528323/" data-ref-id="1100-6528323">Metaphor: ReFantazio won GameSpot's 2024 Game of the Year Award</a>, and earned a 10/10 score in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/" data-ref-id="1900-6418297">GameSpot's Metaphor: ReFantazio review</a>. Reviewer Jessica Cogswell called the RPG "transcendent" and "greater than the sum of its parts," even when those parts are each "masterfully crafted."</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the fantasy world of Euchronia, players set out on a secret mission to assassinate a tyrannical would-be ruler, only for the entire kingdom to be thrown into political upheaval. Soon players are thrust into a competition to become the kingdom's next monarch, and along the way are joined by a ragtag group of heroes representing Euchronia's various fantasy races as they all seek to make the world a better place.</p><p dir="ltr">Metaphor: ReFantazio is every bit as stylish as Atlus' previous Persona work, with some of the most impressive menus and animations ever seen in a turn-based RPG. Persona fans will feel right at home with Metaphor's combat, too, which sees characters transform into different Archetypes to use unique powers. It also sports a standout soundtrack that feels unique to its fantasy universe yet still familiar to composer Shoji Meguro's previous Atlus work.</p><p dir="ltr">Other big <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/more-new-game-pass-titles-for-may-2025-include-2024s-best-and-day-one-releases/2900-6599/" data-ref-id="2900-6599">Game Pass additions in May</a> have included the newly released Xbox first-party title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and indie sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-train-2/" data-ref-id="5000-663832">Monster Train 2</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-joins-game-pass-today-as-battle-for-brooklyn-expansion-and-year-7-launches/1100-6531831/" data-ref-id="1100-6531831">The Division 2 (alongside the new Battle for Brooklyn expansion)</a> and the new game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-to-a-t-launches-in-may/1100-6529669/" data-ref-id="1100-6529669">To a T</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/katamari-damacy/" data-ref-id="5000-19797">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi.</p>

      </div>
<p>All 136 FBS schools are represented in CFB 26, while more than 300 real-world coaches have lent their likenesses to the game, which launches on July 10 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>CFB 26 also has expanded player types and abilities, including 84 total abilities and 10 new archetypes to help players customize their roster to their liking. Additionally, EA added a new "wear and tear" system that requires players to manage player fatigue and injuries.</p><p>The game also sports better AI, improved blocking and coverages, and a new "Dynamic Substitutions" system to help "show your opponent what your program is made of."</p><p dir="ltr">The Stadium Pulse system from CFB 25 has been "revamped" for CFB 26 to add new crowd-based challenges and things like "clock distortion" and "extreme screen shake" to help ramp up the intensity in pressure-packed moments. There are also 160 new school-specific chants in CFB 26, along with 10 new PA tracks--including "Enter Sandman" by Metallica.</p><p dir="ltr">The broadcast and commentary team from CFB 25 returns for the new game, including Chris Fowler, Kirk Herbstreit, Rece Davis, Jesse Palmer, Desmond Howard, and David Pollack.</p><p dir="ltr">EA also said fans can look forward to improved Dynasty and Road to Glory modes, while the Road to the College Football Playoff mode has a new online progression format.</p><p dir="ltr">CFB 26 launches July 10, but people who buy the game's deluxe edition or the EA Sports MVP Bundle--which includes CFB 26 and Madden NFL 26--can start playing on July 7. There will also be a free 10-hour trial for EA Play members, which means Game Pass Ultimate subscribers have access, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Standard Edition of EA Sports College Football 26 features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-cover-features-two-top-wide-receivers/1100-6531832/" data-ref-id="1100-6531832">Alabama's Ryan Williams and Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith</a>, two of the top-ranked wide receivers in the country.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorders-up-for-grabs-for-ps5-and-xbox/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">CFB 26 preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Sales numbers for CFB 25 were never announced, but EA said recently that the game drove <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q4/Q4-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL1.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than $1 billion in "net bookings,"</a> which means revenue.

                <p>Subscription services for video games have grown over the years, but former PlayStation Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida has expressed concern about them. In an interview, Yoshida spoke about how the expansion of first-party titles could eventually lead to third-party studios being shut out of subscription services, as the companies could prefer to hedge their bets with a growing library of first-party releases instead of experimental games.</p><p>"If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions, that's really dangerous because what [type] of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services," Yoshida said to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" rel="nofollow ">Game Developer at Gamescom LATAM</a>. "That's really, really risky because there must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry."</p>

<p>Yoshida added that Sony's approach is "healthier" as the company only adds first-party releases to its PlayStation Plus service after they've been on the market for a certain amount of time. Once sales have tailed off on a first-party game, it usually finds its way onto PS Plus, thus allowing more people to experience it for the first time.</p><p>In comparison, Microsoft's main selling point for Xbox Game Pass is that games developed by its internal studios are day-one releases on its subscription program, and third-party games have also been included in this strategy. So far, 2025 has seen day-one launches of big titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, Doom: The Dark Ages, and South of Midnight on Xbox Game Pass. The releases have been fairly diverse as well, with games like Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush joining traditional fare like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Forza Motorsport.</p><p>Developer Rebellion's newest game, Atomfall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/" data-ref-id="1100-6531671">was also "immediately profitable,"</a> and the studio recently spoke about<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-dev-discusses-game-pass-launch-and-risk-of-cannibalizing-sales/1100-6530925/" data-ref-id="1100-6530925"> why it was a good business decision</a> to release it through Game Pass. At the same time, another developer has spoken <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/" data-ref-id="1100-6514084">about the risks of Game Pass</a>, and Microsoft has also clarified its own statements on the service <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">potentially cannibalizing game sales</a>.</p><p>Yoshida did praise Microsoft for its backwards compatibility, a feat of engineering that he called "smart and very well planned" for its subscribers. PS Plus--and Xbox Game Pass--will be home to a day-one third-party release in June, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">Remedy Entertainment's FBC: Firebreak will be available through those services</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-playstation-plus-may-2025-games-for-premium-and-extra-subscribers/2900-6587/">PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue was also updated this week</a> with a few more titles, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-june-2025/1100-6531805/">June's PS Plus games</a> includes a few recent titles from 2024 like the Alone in the Dark remake, Destiny 2: The Final Shape, and NBA 2K25.</p>

                <p>A federal court has blocked US President Donald Trump's plans to institute major global tariffs, a plan announced in April that sent global markets into a frenzy. Trump attempted to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to implement the tariffs, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-trade-court-0392dbd59f548e49ad4f64254ae3f94a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a three-judge panel rejected this</a>. What all of this means for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and other gaming products, however, is unknown at the moment.</p><p>The ruling said Trump may still be able to implement import taxes of 15% for 150 days on certain countries where the US is in a major trade deficit, however.</p><p>The US government may have to refund companies that paid the tariffs. George Mason University professor Ilya Somin, who worked on a related tariff case, told <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/28/federal-court-strikes-down-trumps-april-2-tariffs-00373843" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Politico</a>, "Anybody that has had to pay tariffs so far will be able to get them refunded."</p><p>The US Justice Department is appealing the decision, and it's possible the case could be heard by the US Supreme Court if it goes far enough.</p><p>Nintendo cited Trump's tariffs as one of the reasons why Switch 2 preorders were initially delayed. While the Switch 2 price remains at $450, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some accessories.</a> Microsoft raised Xbox console prices, citing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">"market conditions,"</a> but without mentioning tariffs specifically. Sony, for its part, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-prices-have-increased-in-some-regions-but-not-the-us/1100-6530829/" data-ref-id="1100-6530829">raised PS5 prices in April.</a> Tabletop gaming companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tabletop-game-publisher-is-very-publicly-suing-trump-administration-over-tariffs/1100-6531040/" data-ref-id="1100-6531040">affected by the tariffs</a>, too.</p><p>Whether or not gaming companies were baking the tariffs into their price increases is unclear; also unclear is whether or not companies will offer refunds. </p><p>Gaming companies might raise prices for any number of reasons, beyond a potential impact of tariffs. For example, experts agree that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay more</a> for their favorite products because the data shows they will. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">about $50 more expensive than the original Switch</a>, adjusted for inflation, and Nintendo might be charging more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because people will pay it</a>.</p>

<p>The notes don't go into too much more detail than that, though, as you can see the whole list of patch notes below:</p><h2>Patch contents</h2><ul><li>Improved handling of playable characters</li><li>Soundtrack addition and adjustments</li><li>Text adjustments</li><li>Balance adjustments</li><li>Added character scenarios</li><li>Bug fixes</li></ul><p>These patch notes also came with some warnings about the PC version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. There is an issue where the game won't boot up on PC. However, this can be resolved by opening the Properties menu for Elden Ring Nightreign from your Steam library, navigating to the Installed Files submenu, and selecting the Verify Integrity of Game Files option.</p><p>Then, once the game is booted up, some PCs "using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops." Bandai Namco has not clarified which graphics cards in particular are affected or how severe the frame rate drops are, but says it is "currently investigating the cause." It's recommended that players set the graphics settings to Medium or Low and install the latest graphics-card drivers to avoid these performance issues in the interim.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign launches today for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.
