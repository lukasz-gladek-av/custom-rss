Case in point: Circana senior director Mat Piscatella has revealed that the cube console focused on motion controls has topped every single PS5 and Xbox SKU for units sold in the US for a holiday week.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m74irgumzc2z" rel="nofollow ">On BlueSky</a>, Piscatella posted the possibly shocking video game hardware statistics for the week ending November 22. The top-selling hardware option was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2JGYX3F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">the Nex Playground</a> at No. 2. Meanwhile, the PS5 Slim digital edition with 1TB came in third place. Obviously, there are multiple options when choosing a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S--various bundles and hard drive configurations--and each one represents a SKU. So one caveat with Circana's info is that the list isn't showing overall Switch 2, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S units sold.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m74irgumzc2z" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreia322nlfoz43oosiekrrqcbmwxxttuaf4ixdbpj5d5fj4t7oj3k4u" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>US best-selling hardware SKUs for week ending Nov 22, 2025, ranked on units sold: 1) NS2 Mario Kart World Bundle 2) NEX Playground Interactive Gaming System 3) PS5 Slim Digital 1 TB So that's neat.

  </div><p dir="ltr">In fact, this isn't the first time Nex Playground has upped Sony's system in the US for a short time. In July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nex-playground-active-play-system-video-game-console-deal/1100-6527044/">the cubed console went on sale for Prime Day</a> and sold more units over the past month than any PS5 option on Amazon.</p><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar, Nex Playground relies on motion-based movement for players. In other words, this console is very similar to Xbox Kinect, featuring a camera to track bodies for interacting with games. Nex Playground comes with five titles installed, and owners can purchase <a href="https://www.nexplayground.com/play-pass" rel="nofollow ">a subscription Play Pass</a> for a larger library of games. It's $49 for three months or $89 for a year.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-console-bundle-is-discounted-for-cyber-monday/1100-6536599/">Switch 2 Mario Kart World bundle is available for $50 off</a> at select retailers, though this deal wasn't available during the time period noted by Circana. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DGY63Z2H,B0FRSYZGBM,B0FRSZT2H5,B0FLYKJB68,B0CL61F39H,B0CL5KNB9M,B0FRGTYSL5,B0FRGMYJMG,B0DSLTZ6M3,B0CJT5DJ16,B0C1Q9X8VH,B0FP6H8BRZ&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="nofollow ">PS5 discounts </a>began around November 20 so would be included briefly for that week last month.</p>
