                <p>Cygames, the developer and publisher behind the popular series of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-smooth-sky-sailing/1900-6418176/" data-ref-id="1900-6418176">Granblue Fantasy video games</a>, just opened an AI-focused studio. In response to the backlash toward this announcement, Cygames put out a message trying to assuage players' fears about generative AI's use in its games. The message isn't very reassuring, though.</p><p>This kerfuffle started on January 9, when a post on <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cygames' Japanese website</a> revealed that Cygames AI Studio had been established. The announcement explains that this new studio will research and develop its own models and provide services to others while drawing on Cygames' game development history and expertise.</p><p>The use of artificial intelligence, specifically generative AI, has become a very hot-button issue in the video game industry as of late. Games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-my-game-of-the-year-but-its-use-of-generative-ai-really-sucks/1100-6537140/" data-ref-id="1100-6537140">Arc Raiders</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> have faced backlash over their use of the technology, and each new AI-related gaming announcement online usually draws the ire of fans.</p><p>This announcement in particular made the fans of Granblue and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/" data-ref-id="1100-6533094">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> nervous, as many don't want to see generative AI in their favorite games. In response, Cygames released the following message on X, hoping to quell player fears:</p><p>The biggest takeaways from the statement are that generative AI art isn't currently being used in Cygames' titles, and that the company "won't implement generative AI into our products without prior notice."</p><p>While Cygames goes on to say it wants to respect the "dignity, passion, and heart of the creators and artists who act as the architects of gaming culture," that message wasn't exactly reassuring. Many don't just want a warning over the use of generative AI, but for it to not be used at all.</p><p>The establishment of Cygames AI Studio and this message definitely mean players should keep a close eye on Cygames' releases going forward to see whether or not they'll use generative AI.</p>

                <p>Actor Ron Perlman is known in Fallout fandom for delivering the now-iconic voice line, "War. War never changes." Perlman will forever be associated with this line and Fallout in general, and now the actor has revealed how he was compensated for the original Fallout game.</p><p>"They invited me to do the very first Fallout and gave me $40 and a sandwich," he said in a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thejoevulpispodcast/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Joe Vulpis Podcast</a>, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-and-a-sandwich-for-his-first-fallout-role-3304278/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by Dexerto.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrITTwBuAUA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TrITTwBuAUA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Fallout game, which was made by Interplay, was released in 1997. It wasn't until some time later that Perlman became aware of the phenomenon that became Fallout.</p><p>"A year and a half later, I get a call, 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' No. 'Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' ‘Because the first one went through the f**king roof,'" he remembered thinking. "I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, then the third, fourth, and now it's a whole brand."</p><p>Also in the interview, Perlman said he's never played the Fallout games or spent any time with the development teams. "No. I did a couple of lines, got my $40 and my sandwich, and went home," he said.</p><p>Crucially, Perlman did not disclose what kind of sandwich he got for his work on Fallout.</p><p>Fallout 2 was developed by Black Isle Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-developing-and-publishing-fallout-3/1100-6102349/" data-ref-id="1100-6102349">Bethesda swooped in and bought the rights to the series in 2007</a> and made Fallout 3, released in 2008, as its first entry in the series. Bethesda would go on to release Fallout 4 in 2015 and Fallout 76 in 2018 (2010's Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian and published by Bethesda). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> is now in development, but it's not coming anytime soon.</p><p>On the more immediate horizon, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">Bethesda is working on remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. </a></p><p>In other Fallout news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Prime Video's Fallout TV series is airing now</a>, with Episode 5 having just released today, January 14. Three more episodes are coming before the series wraps up on February 4.
