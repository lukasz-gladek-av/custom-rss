Pokemon Legends Arceus had alternate Hisuin final evolutions for its starters, each with a different typing compared to their original forms. It hasn't been confirmed whether the starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A will have alternate final evolutions as well.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Mega Evolutions will be making a return</a>, so it's possible that the starters could receive those. There's been a precendent set with Mega Evolutions where some get new typing, such as Mega Ampharos being Electric/Dragon instead of pure Electric type and Pinsir becoming a Bug/Flying type when it Mega Evolves instead of staying pure Bug.</p><p>Let's take a look at what we know about the three starters and what potential changes Legends Z-A could bring to them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="4000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451290"></a><figcaption>The three starters in Pokemon Legends Z-A (from left to right): Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1646/16465123/4451290-image_2025-02-27_104937411.jpg"></figure><h2>Chikorita</h2><p>Chikorita is the Grass type starter from Generation 2, and is unfortunately the worst starter of its trio, as well as considered to be one of the worst starters historically. That's mostly due to the shallow pool of moves its final form, Meganium, can learn and its mediocre stats. However, a Mega Evolution or alternate form could drastically improve Meganium.</p><p>Nintendo could lean into Meganium's reptilian design and give it a secondary Dragon typing. Meganium already learns some Dragon type attacks, including Dragon Tail and Outrage, but a secondary Dragon type would also power them up by 50% due to STAB, or Same Type Attack Bonus. This would make Meganium more offensively viable.</p><p>Meganium is more defensively oriented, and a Dragon typing would be a bit of a mixed bag. It would bolster its already impressive resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric moves. However, it would add Dragon and Fairy weaknesses.</p><p>An alternate form with the Grass/Fairy typing would give Meganium the best of both worlds, defensively and offensively. Fairy is regarded as one of the best types in Pokemon so far.</p><p>A secondary Fairy type would gives Meganium an immunity to Dragon type attacks and new resistances to Dark and Fighting type attacks, while only adding one additional weakness to Steel type attacks. However, it would now take quadruple damage from Poison-type attacks instead of double. A secondary Fairy typing also cancels out Meganium's weaknesses to bug types too, making them only do neutral damage.</p><p>Offensively, Fairy is a powerful type, hitting Dark, Dragon, and Fighting types for extra damage. However, Meganium will still struggle against Fire and Poison types, as they resist Fairy type attacks.</p><h2>Tepig</h2><p>Tepig is the Fire starter from Generation 5 and its final evolution is Emboar, a Fire/Fighting type. With high offensive stats on both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, along with a versatile attacking movepool, Emboar doesn't need as much as a drastic change like Meganium. However, if Nintendo wants to switch up Emboar's typing in a Mega Evolution or alternate form, one possibility is Fire/Ground. Thematically, that would fit Emboar as a pig, rolling around in the mud.</p><p>A secondary Ground typing might actually make Emboar worse, as it would take quadruple damage from Water type attacks and lose its Grass resistance. However, it would gain an Electric immunity. Either way, Emboar is fine as it is, and it's possible that it could retain its Fire/Fighting typing if given an alternate form.</p><h2>Totodile</h2><p>Totodile is Generation 2's Water type starter. Of the Johto trio, it's the most physically offensive, making it a popular option. Its final evolution is Feraligatr, which, like Emboar, also doesn't need a massive overhaul. Feraligatr is a pure Water type, so it's possible that it could gain a secondary typing.</p><p>The secondary typing that makes the most sense thematically for Feraligatr would be Dark, as that plays into Totodile's mischievous and playful nature. Plus, Feraligatr already learns plenty of Dark type moves such as Bite, Crunch, Fake Tears, Snarl, and Lash Out. A secondary Dark typing would also give its Dark attacking moves the STAB bonus.</p><p>Feraligatr is reptilian, just like Meganium, so a Water/Dragon typing fits too. Feraligatr already learns moves like Dragon Claw, Outrage, and Dragon Dance. As long as a Mega Evolution or alternate form of Meganium isn't Grass/Dragon, Feraligatr can go down the route as a Dragon type, as I don't imagine Nintendo would want to double up on the Dragon typing for two starters.</p><p>Pokemon Legends Z-A is set to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">launch in late 2025 for Nintendo Switch</a>. It'll have a new take on the traditional Pokemon battle system, including real-time elements with attack moves that have a certain amount of reach. Moving Pokemon out of the way will cause attacks to miss.</p>
