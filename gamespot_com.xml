The latest release from heralded indie developer Heart Machine entered early access on Steam today, January 14, so this is a pretty generous launch discount.</p><p dir="ltr">While purchasing Hyper Light Breaker through Fanatical gets you an official Steam key, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam is also offering a special launch deal</a> that bundles Hyper Light Breaker with a free copy of the first entry in the series, the Zelda-inspired action-adventure game Hyper Light Drifter, for $27 (was $30). Fanatical's Hyper Light Breaker launch deal does not include the bonus Hyper Light Drifter key, but it's worth considering if you want to save some cash on the new game--especially if you already own Hyper Light Drifter. </p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-finally-launches-into-early-access-this-week-new-trailer-showcases-what-to-expect/1100-6528788/" data-ref-id="1100-6528788">early access launch trailer</a>, Hyper Light Breaker is a prequel set before the events of Drifter. Players take on the role of Breakers, who are elite warriors tasked with restoring civilization by exploring an ever-changing realm called The Overgrowth and defeating the evil Abyss King who controls it. Players team up in online co-op and head out in expeditions to explore, defeat bosses, and collect loot--then return to base to upgrade the settlement with the resources you acquired, gear up, and head back out to an all-new version of the Overgrowth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png" data-ref-id="1300-4427649"></a><figcaption>Hyper Light Breaker</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4427649-hyperlightbreaker.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Note that like all early access games, Hyper Light Breaker is not considered a finished game yet, and you're likely to encounter some bugs and performance issues if you dive in now.

Heart Machine is working to address performance issues and bugs as quickly as possible. AS of 5:30 PM PT, Hyper Light Breaker holds a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Mixed" review average on Steam</a> based on roughly 600 reviews.</p><p dir="ltr">The initial early access version only includes a portion of the planned final content, with more playable characters, bosses, equipment types, and other additional updates planned between now and the final launch. Hyper Light Drifter's Steam page says the early access period is planned to last around a year, but that is subject to change. </p><p dir="ltr">Between making Hyper Light Drifter and Breaker, Heart Machine also launched the 3D platformer Solar Ash. While the gameplay style differs from the Hyper Light series, Solar Ash shares many of the same aesthetic elements and is worth checking out to see what else the team has made.

Along with hundreds of images, you’ll also get a detailed rundown of character profiles, world lore, and more. Considering the game has deep mythology to pull from, there should be plenty of incredible details packed between its covers. Wo Long was quite popular when it released in 2023--if you’re worried about the art book selling out, consider landing a preorder soon. Note that the final cover art has not yet been revealed.</p>                      </div><p>The book is being published by Udon Entertainment--a brand that has previously worked on art books for Elden Ring, Dark Souls, Bloodborne, and Monster Hunter. All of these earned positive reviews from readers, and The Art of Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty should retain the brand’s high-quality publishing standards.</p><p>These previous volumes also make great companions for the upcoming book, and since many are currently on sale, they’re worth checking out ahead of The Art of Wo Long’s release in July.

Players on Steam have left some unflattering reviews about the game's bugs at this stage, but developer Heart Machine is promising that fixes are on the way.</p><p>In a post on social media, Heart Machine apologized for the issues with the game and noted that it is "pushing out performance improvements ASAP." In a separate post, Heart Machine invited players to <a href="https://x.com/HLBreaker/status/1879261225663819981" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">share their dxdiag info on Discord</a> if they're having problems on a machine that meets or exceeds the game's system requirements.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/HLBreaker/status/1879260551500747055" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🛑Apologies for anyone experiencing issues!🛑 We're pushing out performance improvements ASAP.<br>We're adding a vsync toggle, but for now, you can add this launch option in Steam to enable vsync "-ExecCmds="r.vsync 1""<br>We'll also roll out mouse sensitivity settings ASAP! <a href="https://t.co/V2sTGHDPle" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/V2sTGHDPle</a></p>  — Hyper Light Breaker - Early Access NOW LIVE!

A few of the reviews have good things to say about the combat in this roguelike game, but the general consensus is that Hyper Light Breaker lacks polish even at this stage in its development. Heart Machine has replied to some of the negative reviews and said it will address the issues that were brought up.</p><p>Hyper Light Breaker is currently available at a discounted price of $27 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1534840/Hyper_Light_Breaker/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, which will rise to $30 once that promotion ends.

The original Lunar: Silver Star Story is considered a landmark title in the Japanese RPG lineage and was one of the first console RPGs to feature voice acting, animated cutscenes, and CD-quality music thanks to its original platform, the Sega CD. It was later remade for PS1 and Sega Saturn as Lunar: Silver Star Story Complete, which is the version included in the Lunar Remastered Collection. Its sequel, Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, also launched on PS1 and Saturn and built upon the gameplay and story presentation of the first game, featuring even more voiced dialogue and a larger cast.</p><p dir="ltr">Voice acting, cutscenes, and high-quality soundtracks are now common elements of video games, they were groundbreaking at the time--though the voice performances and the localized English script are now notorious for their uneven quality. However, the new Remastered Collection includes all-new English text and voice acting for both games. While the new English voice tracks replace the originals, the Lunar Remastered collection includes the option to play with Japanese voice acting instead. You can also swap between the new enhanced visuals or the PS1 visuals for both games.</p><p>Lunar isn't the only classic RPG series getting long-awaited remasters this year.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The Sims 25th anniversary is next month, and as expected, EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-25th-anniversary-celebration-features-free-content-in-game-events-and-a-25-hour-stream/1100-6528814/">loads of activities, updates</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-three-new-sims-4-content-kits-including-one-made-with-lilsimsies-help/1100-6528807/">new content</a> planned for the celebration. But one thing players weren't expecting was the surprise update EA just launched for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-3/">The Sims 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The new update simply fixes an issue that made newer Intel CPUs unable to run The Sims 3, allowing the game to be run on modern machines more easily. Although EA hasn't made a public statement regarding the update, some players are hoping this could mean more updates for The Sims 3 are on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether that's the case or not is hard to say. After all, EA hasn't even publicly acknowledged that it launched the update. But even if EA has no more planned content for The Sims 3, players--and modders especially--are thrilled to see new life breathed into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"So it begins," Sims modder <a href="https://x.com/SimMattically/status/1878888709535490291" rel="nofollow ">SimMattically tweeted</a> after discovering the update.</p><p dir="ltr">The last time The Sims 3 received an update was back in November 2015, and it's entirely possible the latest update was simply released to ensure players continue to buy the game. But players who miss the game's incredibly detailed customization options (many of which are still absent from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>) are happy to see this update, even if it's not necessarily indicative that more Sims 3 content is on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">During its heyday, The Sims 3 struggled to run even on high-end PCs. Crashes and bugs were common, but players loved the ability to make Sims' hair, clothes, nails, and furniture any color they wished via the game's color wheel. That color wheel is almost entirely absent from The Sims 4--it can be used when coloring a pet's fur, but cannot be used on Sims' hair, clothes, furniture, walls, or flooring. Sims 4 players have bemoaned the game's lack of customization options for years, and since modern machines will now have an easier time running The Sims 3 without crashing, the latest update allows nostalgic Simmers to travel back to the good old days, when Sims (and their houses) could be any color of the rainbow.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no telling whether EA will release further updates for The Sims 3--and if they do, those updates are likely to be focused on stability improvements rather than new content. Still, being able to load up an ancient save file and customize Sims to your heart's content is certainly something to celebrate, even if the update itself isn't officially a part of The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is celebrating its 25th anniversary next month, but EA kicked off the festivities early via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">new episode of Behind The Sims</a>, giving players a peek at what the future holds for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a>, including base game updates, free in-game content, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-three-new-sims-4-content-kits-including-one-made-with-lilsimsies-help/1100-6528807/">a trio of new Kits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest episode, which aired live on The Sims' YouTube channel, provided a look at the game's upcoming content roadmap and hinted at some other surprises, including a 25-hour livestream that will feature a "special guest [who players] might know."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Per EA, The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration schedule is as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 14:</strong> The Sims 4 main menu UI overhaul</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 16:</strong> Three new Kits launch, including the Secret Sanctuary Kit, the Casanova Cave Kit, and the Comfy Gamer Kit, the latter of which was created in collaboration with popular Sims 4 YouTuber LilSimsie.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>January 27 - 31:</strong> Nostalgia Now Event (No details have been shared regarding this event, though it could be a login event that rewards players with exclusive in-game items.)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 4:</strong><ul><li dir="ltr">A 25-hour livestream featuring the aforementioned mysterious special guest will take place.</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 Blast From The Past Event begins, featuring free rewards "inspired by iconic items from the 2000s, like a milk carton, telephone, alarm clock, triple-tiered birthday cake, and inflatable chair and loveseat."</li><li dir="ltr">The Sims 4 will receive new (free) base game content featuring over 70 new in-game items including hairstyle, basic clothing, new swatches, and more.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 6:</strong> Motherload Season begins. EA hasn't yet shared details regarding what exactly this event will consist of, but given the fact that it's named after the in-game cheat used to fill a Sim's bank account with cash, it's probably safe to say this season will be all about those sweet, sweet Simoleons.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>February 25:</strong> ???</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4427397"></a><figcaption>The Sims 25th Anniversary celebration is packed to the brim with content celebrating the series' history--and its future.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4427397-sims25.jpg"></figure><p>Whatever EA has planned for February 25, The Sims 4 devs are keeping their lips zipped for now, with an emoji of two large eyeballs in place of the event's description. But it's possible that February 25 will see the announcement of the game's next expansion packs, as EA has historically used large Sims-based events to promote upcoming DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">The livestream also revealed that The Sims 25th Anniversary event will include a free update that gives the game's generally underwhelming townie homes a much-needed makeover, with pools and other features that weren't available when those houses were first created. It's unclear if the digital dollhouse redecoration will take place as part of the free update on February 4, or if it will launch later in the month.</p><p>For more information on all the new content coming to The Sims 4, The Sims FreePlay, and MySims: Cozy Bundle--plus details on The Sims 25th Anniversary merch--check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" rel="nofollow ">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>
