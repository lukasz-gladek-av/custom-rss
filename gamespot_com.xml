                <p dir="ltr">Nearly five years into the lifespan of the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 consoles, many live-service games still support the previous generation's Xbox One and PlayStation 4, but the number is always at risk of dropping. Today, Krafton announced it would be the next developer to end support for those last-gen consoles, as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds will no longer be supported on Xbox One and PS4 beginning November 13.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox One and PS4 support for PUBG will be shut off "during live server maintenance on November 13, 2025," according to the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow ">announcement post on PUBG's official website</a>. The server maintenance will also make enhancements to the current-gen versions, including upgraded resolution and frame-rate options.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549301"></a><figcaption>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4549301-pubg.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It weighs heavily on us to deliver this news to our console players who have enjoyed PUBG on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One for so many years," the announcement post reads. "This was not a decision made lightly. It comes after long and careful consideration, in pursuit of the continued growth and long-term future of PUBG Console. We kindly ask for your understanding."</p><p dir="ltr">The post also says that PUBG will no longer be downloadable or playable on the older systems, but that all progress made will be saved and carried over to the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 versions. PlayStation players will have to download and install the PS5-specific version of PUBG to play, while Xbox players will automatically upgrade to the Series X|S version via the Smart Delivery feature.</p><p dir="ltr">"The supported specifications for current-gen consoles were determined through extensive technical review and internal testing to ensure the most stable and optimized PUBG Console gameplay experience," the post explains. "In particular, memory and graphical specifications have been carefully configured with future content updates in mind, to ensure the system is well-prepared to support them smoothly."</p><p dir="ltr">PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds can be downloaded for free on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation, and PC.</p>

                <p>Congressman Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, has issued a call to the developers of Roblox to "do more" to help protect children amid ongoing reports that the platform is not doing enough to safeguard young people from bad actors.</p><p>"There is a growing issue in our country with Roblox, an online gaming platform, and the abuse of children," Khanna said in a video posted to TikTok. "Roblox is simply not doing enough to protect our kids, to inform parents, and to go after child predators. As you know, I am leading the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/epstein-files-trump-transparency-corruption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fight for the full release of the Epstein files</a>. I believe in transparency and I believe in protecting our children."</p><p>Khanna said he's urging people to <a href="https://act.rokhanna.com/a/save-roblox-petition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign a petition</a> to "push Roblox to do more," asking for 1 million signatures by Friday, August 15. "We need to keep our kids safe online," he said.</p><p>"Roblox is at a crossroads," reads a line from the petition's website. "We're not going to stand by while kids are exploited online, and powerful tech companies can do more to stop it. We need Roblox to do more to protect children, provide more support to parents, and strengthen law enforcement protocols that help bring predators to justice. And give creators a seat at the table."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to the developers of Roblox for comment on Khanna's post.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Bloomberg in 2024</a> exposed a pedophile problem in Roblox. The developer, Roblox Corp., has invested time and resources to catch and remove offending players. The game's billionaire CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/" data-ref-id="1100-6533600">responded to concerns from parents</a>, saying, "My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox," and those comments drew a backlash.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-roblox-safe-a-parents-guide-to-roblox-safety-policies/1100-6533600/" data-ref-id="1100-6533600">GameSpot's breakdown of Roblox's safety policies.</a></p>

Okay cool, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> is making a second Tyranny Park.</p><p>Or at least, it's trying to. Helldivers 2's latest major order--a series of challenges for players to complete as a community--promises the erection of a new Tyranny Park for a hefty set of prices, including the liberation of a planet, the extermination of quite literally millions of the game's bug-like Terminid enemies, and more. Only then can Tyranny Park 2 be completed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1955557044976542126" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: The citizens of Super Earth have endured over a year of war, initiated and perpetuated by the enemies of Freedom.

It even calls back to the first Tyranny Park, which was the focus of an earlier Helldivers 2 initiative some months ago, citing its failure as a "tragic sabotage" whose lessons and victims will not be forgotten. I don't see how any of this could possibly go wrong.</p><p>This major order comes just as Helldivers 2 inches closer to its August 26 release on Xbox systems. Most recently, it's even begun to look like the developers are teasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-teases-halo-3-odst-crossover-ahead-of-its-xbox-launch/1100-6533858/" data-ref-id="1100-6533858">crossover with Halo 3: ODST</a> to celebrate the launch. It sounds to me like between this crossover and Tyranny Park 2, Helldivers 2 players will have a lot going on in the weeks to come.</p>

                <p>Superstar Mode has returned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a>, and it allows you to create your own player and go through the entire NFL experience. This includes the entire pre-draft process, which culminates with getting drafted by one of the 32 NFL teams. However, before you can get drafted, you need to participate in the NFL Combine. The Combine is meant to be a complete evaluation of you as a player, but it's not just your physical traits being tested. There's also a Combine interview where teams will ask you a series of questions, and you need to provide the correct answers.</p><p>While you can try to complete the interview by yourself, we have provided a list of every question and answer for the NFL Combine in the guide below. This lets you completely ace the test and get drafted highly in Madden 26's Superstar Mode.</p><h2>All NFL Combine answers in Madden 26</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289"></a><figcaption>Superstar Mode allows you to take over the NFL in Madden 26, and that starts at the Combine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg"></figure><p>In total, there are six questions you can be asked during the NFL Combine interview, but some of the questions are only for certain positions. You'll be asked five general questions plus a position-specific question for a total of six.</p><p>You also have a choice when it comes to your answers to the questions; specific answers will result in receiving different boosts and rewards in Superstar Mode. So, essentially, there's no wrong answer to a question, but you want to know which answer gives what reward so you can build your player the way you envision.</p><p>Below, we'll list all of the possible questions at the NFL Combine, their answers, and what rewards you earn for the answer you give.</p><h3>General NFL Combine questions and answers</h3><p><strong>It’s Super Bowl Week, and you witness your star teammate violating curfew, how do you handle it?</strong></p><ul><li>Say nothing, he’s his own man (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Tell the coaching staff (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li><li>Talk some sense into him (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li></ul><p><strong>How do you handle a teammate who criticizes the coaching staff to the media after a loss?</strong></p><ul><li>Have his back and tell the media I agree (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as an WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Tell the media I disagree (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li><li>Confront the coach at practice (Future WR influence +50 if playing as a QB/ Future QB influence if playing as WR or HB/ Future DT influence if playing as an LB/ Future MLB influence if playing as a CB)</li><li>Say nothing, let the coaches handle it (Future Head Coach influence +50)</li></ul><p><strong>It’s the 4th quarter and the game is on the line.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was the series' long-anticipated trip to Japan, but it also made some significant changes to the series. Most notable for longtime fans was the absence of "social stealth," a series mainstay that allows your assassin to blend in with a crowd. But Ubisoft says it had good reason for the change, and reassured fans that social stealth could make a comeback.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bf6t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit AMA</a>, a trio of Ubisoft developers addressed a fan who asked about social stealth elements.</p><p>"For Shadows, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth," they said. "Tthat [sic] does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin's Creed franchise, though!"</p><p>Traditionally in an Assassin's Creed game, if a guard gives chase you could lose their sight line and then blend in with a group or sit on a bench to throw them off. In Shadows, however, the shinobi character Naoe would need to find cover or use her rope to climb out of sight to evade capture, rather than just duck behind a corner and look like she's minding her own business. That was only half the equation, too, as the game also featured a samurai character, Yasuke, who was functionally a walking tank. His massive size and ornate armor means he wouldn't exactly be inconspicuous in a crowd.</p><p>The last game before Shadows, Assassin's Creed Mirage, was an explicit throwback to the series' roots, including the setting and some older gameplay elements. It included the social stealth as usual, so it has been in recent memory for the Assassin's Creed series. The next Assassin's Creed game that we know of is codenamed Assassin's Creed Hexe--which may or may not be the final title--and it's reportedly set in 16th century Europe. As the name implies, it focuses on witchcraft and even lets you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-will-let-you-possess-and-control-a-cat-report/1100-6522899/" data-ref-id="1100-6522899">possess a cat</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Official Bring the Boom Trailer (With Halo ODST Teaser) | Out August 26</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, the signal seems familiar but doesn't quite sound like anything from Halo. However, when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1moadmj/clip_comparing_a_segment_of_the_reversed_signal/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-grunts-think-theyve-found-more-evidence-of-a-halo-crossover-thanks-to-a-very-familiar-unknown-signal-detected-by-the-galactic-warning-system-is-that-the-superintendent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signal's audio</a> is reversed, it sounds almost identical to the phone alarm for the AI Superintendent from Halo 3: ODST. It's that alarm which helps guide ODST's Rookie through the embattled streets of New Mombasa following a Covenant invasion. Is the Superintendent now trying to warn Helldivers of a coming threat?</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Arrowhead Studios hasn't said anything official about a Halo crossover just yet, but Halo's ODSTs and Super Earth's Helldivers are so similar that it would be a crime against Managed Democracy if a collaboration didn't happen. What all the crossover will entail is still anybody's guess, but there will almost certainly be ODST cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as was the case when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-first-crossover-is-officially-killzone-2-and-the-dlc-is-out-now/1100-6528541/" data-ref-id="1100-6528541">Helldivers 2 crossed over with Sony's Killzone</a> franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani gave credit to publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">Sony for deciding to release Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a>, stating to a fan on Discord that the choice was "all PlayStation" but that Arrowhead was "all in support of course." Helldivers 2's most recent Control Group Warbond introduced some new experimental tech for players to test out, including a mini-teleportation device and a gun with seven-barrels that can be more than a little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/be-careful-firing-helldivers-2s-new-weapon-if-you-have-a-lot-of-ammo/2900-6760/" data-ref-id="2900-6760">dangerous if you have a lot of ammo</a>.</p>
