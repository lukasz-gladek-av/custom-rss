                <p>A new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">EA Sports College Football 25</a> is here, and a whole lot more college athletes are being added to the game--718 of them, to be precise. The update also contains upgrades to player abilities, rating adjustments, Team Builder, and generative AI features. Here's everything that's new, as well as the full patch notes.</p><p>The update is adding 718 new NIL players, and also new to the game is Nissan Stadium, which will be the default stadium for PlayStation tournaments. The latest update also includes a number of ratings updates for players, as well as an update to overall team rankings. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-uniforms-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/2900-5621/" data-ref-id="2900-5621">Uniform</a> pieces have also been updated or newly added for almost 50 teams in the game.</p><p>The new update also adds Play A Friend mode to College Ultimate Team for the first time, and increased the AP limit to 12 for Season 3.</p><p>Also new in the update is an upgrade for Team Builder that adds Adobe Express integration, providing generative AI tools to create designs, which could prove to be controversial for some players. The tools can be accessed from the logos page, where you'll now see a "Create with Adobe Express" link. You'll need to create or log into an existing Adobe account to use Express, which will provide 25 credits. These can be spent to generate new logos, or you can use to Express create something from scratch.</p><p>While these are the main new additions in the patch, it also contains a whole lot of bug fixes, covering common bugs across regular gameplay, Dynasty, Ultimate Team, and more.</p><p>For everything that's new in the latest update, check out the full patch notes below:</p><h2>Title Update Notes</h2><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Refreshed the Ability Loadouts of players in Front End Rosters.  <ul><li>DEV NOTE: <i>These ability changes are based on current player performance this season and changes to their ratings.

                <p>Blizzard is releasing a highly sought-after mount for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>'s 20th anniversary, but it's turned out to be the game's most expensive mount yet. The Trader's Gilded Brutosaur is just the second Brutosaur mount Blizzard has released, and it costs an eye-watering $90.</p><p>The Gilded Brutosaur's kit isn't just pretty, as it also comes with built-in functionality, allowing you to check your mail or auctions on the go. The golden harness set is themed after WoW's 20th anniversary, set with gems that represent each of the MMORPG's expansions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390282" data-ratio="0.56283422459893" data-width="1496" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390282"></a><figcaption>The Gilded Brutosaur mount</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4390282-wow_traders_brutosaurmount_bnetshop_featureimage-specials_1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>The new mount is just the second time WoW has offered a Brutosaur mount, after the Mighty Caravan Brutosaur added with Battle for Azeroth--which also became infamous for its high price. The Mighty Caravan Brutosaur could be purchased with gold instead of real cash, but the cost was steep: 5 million gold.</p><p>Players have the option to buy WoW Tokens, which can be used to exchange in-game gold for Battle.net credit. However, the <a href="https://www.icy-veins.com/wow/news/wow-tokens-disappear-as-players-rush-to-buy-the-gilded-brutosaur-mount-with-gold/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tokens quickly sold out</a> this week as players rushed to cash in for the Gilded Brutosaur. A single Token can be cashed out for $15 in Battle.net credit, meaning players will need to procure six to buy the Gilded Brutosaur.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RLuDw0xBP8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0RLuDw0xBP8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Even with inflated pricing in place, the Gilded Brutosaur is looking to be a little cheaper in gold than its predecessor, with players <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/wow-token-sold-out-price-rapidly-rising-348753" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expecting to pay</a> around 2.5 million on Tokens--when more supply eventually becomes available.</p><p>As part of WoW's 20th anniversary celebration, the Gilded Brutosaur isn't going to stick around forever--a note on the <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-traders-gilded-brutosaur" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">store page</a> says the mount will only be available until January 6, 2025. </p><p>The celebration will also see the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">return of some of WoW's most-iconic armor</a>, possibly in addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-will-apparently-once-again-get-its-own-game-fuel-with-in-game-loot-to-boot/1100-6527168/" data-ref-id="1100-6527168">Game Fuel</a>.</p>
