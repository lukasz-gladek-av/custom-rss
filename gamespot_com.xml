                <p>It's been a long time since MercurySteam released an original game, but the studio behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-samus-returns-review/1900-6416751/" data-ref-id="1900-6416751">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> has finally revealed a first look at its upcoming dark fantasy action-RPG Blades of Fury. In the announcement trailer below, players are introduced to Aran de Lira as he prepares to face his destiny head-on against some dangerous foes. Luckily for Aran, he's well-armed with weapons of his own creation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WOrS00j1Zo" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8WOrS00j1Zo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the game's backstory, Aran is the firstborn of the King's Ward, and he's forced to take a stand after the recently crowned Queen Nerea uses dark magic to solidify her power in the kingdom. Thanks to Nerea's spell, all steel in the kingdom has been turned to stone, and only the evil creatures at her command have the divine metal that can obliterate any normal weapon used against them.</p><p>That's why Aran will have to forge his own weapons to counter the divine metal's power, and there are several different weapons that can be chosen. Players will have to determine which weapons are most effective against the wide variety of monsters they encounter in the game. Picking the wrong weapon could have grave consequences and leave Aran unable to defeat his foes.</p><p>MercurySteam has teased that certain details about the story will be unknown, and "you will know only what our heroes know; your intuition and courage must fill in the rest." Thankfully, Aran doesn't have to figure it all out for himself. His companion, Adso, can aid him during battles with suggestions about how to defeat the creatures. Adso also speaks the language of the ancient forger, which will come in handy as they brave dangerous castles and mazes.</p><p>Blades of Fire will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC via the Epic Games Store on May 22.</p>
