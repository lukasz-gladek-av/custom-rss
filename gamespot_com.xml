The US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that Roblox is "part of an active and ongoing investigation."</p><p><a href="https://hntrbrk.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunterberg Media</a> originally reported last fall that Roblox was under investigation by the SEC over charges that it "inflated key metrics" for investors on Wall Street and for its lax safety measures regarding potential child predators on the platform. The SEC did not confirm that Roblox's parent company, The Roblox Corporation, is under investigation. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed that the SEC refused to provide details of its investigation because it may "harm... the ongoing enforcement proceeding."</p><p>In November 2024, The Roblox Corporation laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">new safety guidelines for children</a> on the platform. Children under the age of 13 are no longer allowed access to unrated experiences created within Roblox, and only children 13 and older will be allowed to utilize the social hangouts and free-form user-creation experiences. That move came after a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> story which noted that The Roblox Company reported over 13,000 instances of child exploitation to authorities in 2023. Moreover, two dozen people were arrested for abusing children after making contact with them through the platform.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to that report</a> by touting its cooperation with law enforcement to combat illegal activity on the platform. It also suggested that Bloomberg's report didn't contextualize the scale of the child exploitation problem with Roblox's large user base.</p><p>During last year's Roblox Developers Conference, The Roblox Corporation reiterated its plans to reach <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. If it's proven that The Roblox inflated its current estimate of daily Roblox users to investors, that could potentially lead to severe penalties from the SEC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> will receive its mid-Season 1 update on February 21, bringing new heroes, big changes to the game's meta, and a rank reset for competitive mode enjoyers, developer NetEase has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, NetEase said competitive players will have their ranks drop four divisions following the mid-season update. The mid-season rank drop is happening due to "major balance changes" that are expected to "shake-up the battlefield" for the remainder of the game's first competitive season.</p>

<p dir="ltr">There are a few additional changes coming to competitive as well, with a new Gold rank and above costume for players to earn and Crests of Honor cosmetics for players at Grandmaster rank and above that will have a unique design each season. NetEase said players will need to complete 10 matches in competitive mode in order to claim the rewards for any given season.</p><p dir="ltr">What balance changes are in store for Marvel Rivals is still under wraps, but NetEase did confirm that the Human Torch and The Thing will be making their debut alongside the mid-season update. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>. Meanwhile, Human Torch will be added to the game's increasingly large <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelist</a> lineup. With the additions of the two heroes, the entire Fantastic Four will be playable in Marvel Rivals, with NetEase having added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-invisible-woman-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-unseen-force/2300-6465576/" data-ref-id="2300-6465576">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-mister-fantastic-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-stretching-into-action/2300-6465572/" data-ref-id="2300-6465572">Mr. Fantastic</a> at the beginning of Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">NetEase has already said players can expect new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-marvel-rivals-characters-will-release-much-more-often-than-you-might-expect/1100-6528797/" data-ref-id="1100-6528797">two new playable characters every season</a>--one at the beginning and another at the season's mid-point, with each Marvel Rivals seasons lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-balance-update-is-full-of-buffs-and-nerfs-for-each-role-full-patch-notes/1100-6528702/" data-ref-id="1100-6528702">first major balance changes for Marvel Rivals as part of Season 1</a> nerfed some of its most popular damage-dealing Duelist characters while buffing many of the game's powerful Strategist (aka support) heroes. Given how dominate Strategists and their game-halting healing ultimate abilities currently are, it's likely nerfs are incoming for characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger and Luna Snow. However, players will have to wait for the official patch notes to see what's in store for Marvel Rivals mid-Season 1 update.</p>

                <p>Back in the '90s, nothing was better than sitting down in front of a TV to watch a color-coordinated group of teenagers with attitude beat the putty out of various monsters. Fast-forward to today, and Angel Grove's finest warriors are back in the spotlight with the co-op side-scrolling brawler Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind. The digital version of the game launched on consoles and PC back in December 2024, but publisher Atari is finally releasing physical PS5 and Nintendo Switch versions on May 30.

                <p>In the lore of Resident Evil, two of the franchise's top villains--Nemesis and Albert Wesker aka The Mastermind--have never crossed paths. But starting today in<span> </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-by-daylight-review-2020-toying-with-terror/1900-6417532/" data-ref-id="1900-6417532">Dead by Daylight</a>'s third collaboration with Resident Evil, Wesker and Nemesis are teaming up as two of the killers in the game's latest 2v8 mode.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has shared a trailer for the new Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil crossover, as Nemesis and Wesker corner a handful of RE's heroes including Jill Valentine, Leon Kennedy, Ada Wong, and Rebecca Chambers. Among this crew, Jill is the one who has experience fighting Nemesis in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a> and Wesker in some of the other games. But even with backup, Jill and the others are significantly outmatched by this duo.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dead by Daylight | 2v8: Resident Evil Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Dead by Daylight collaborations take place outside of Resident Evil continuity, so the game doesn't have to explain how any of this fits into RE's storylines. But the 2v8 mode does feature a map from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3 that recreates Raccoon City's Police Department. Additionally, Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs can be found and used for healing by the heroes. But if either Wesker or Nemesis find the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a boost of speed.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has previously stated that there will be two survivor bots on every team in this 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. The current Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil collaboration is only running through February 25. But we know of at least one big crossover coming down the line this summer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">Dead by Daylight x Five Nights At Freddy's</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX performance has generated a lot of online chatter, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with Drake. When the Grammy-winning rapper took the stage for the halftime show, the stage itself took the form of a tic-tac-toe board--but X's and O's were accompanied by a triangle and a square, which were meant to evoke the aesthetic of a "PlayStation-style controller," according to the show's coordinators and set designers. The idea--which Lamar personally dreamed up--was meant to represent the rapper's life as though it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people," art director Shelley Rodgers told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="nofollow ">Wired</a>. "A lot of it is showing his journey, [showing him] traveling through the American dream."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime show set was inspired by the PlayStation controller, show's art director says </p><p>"Each performance space was shaped like a button on a PlayStation-style controller, a performance intended to portray Lamar’s life as a video game." </p><p>Via: <a href="https://twitter.com/WIRED?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WIRED</a> <a href="https://t.co/OhQZmjTWEM" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/OhQZmjTWEM</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1888967930047594584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Creative director Mike Carson added that Lamar and his production company, pgLang, are "really into keeping things clean and minimal."</p><p dir="ltr">"We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music," Carson said.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite the stage's streamlined, minimalist design, the folks running the show had several difficult hurdles to overcome. Lamar, his backup dancers, the lighting, and the stage itself had to be set up and ready to go in under eight minutes. Once the performance ended, production had had roughly six minutes to get everything off the field--without messing up the turf. Even though the Superdome's turf is synthetic, protecting it was still no small task, especially given the fact that part of the set dressing was a real GNX that had been heavily modified to allow Lamar's numerous backup dancers to enter the stage in a clown car-esque manner.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were on board with our vision from day one," Carson said of Shelley Rodgers, who worked to bring the vehicular optical illusion to life. "Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line."</p><p dir="ltr">But every good game needs a villain, and the halftime show appeared to serve as the final act in Lamar's seemingly endless beef with fellow rapper Drake. At one point in the show, Lamar told his female backup dancers that he wanted to perform "Not Like Us," but had decided against it because "people like to sue." But near the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 13-minute performance</a>, Lamar performed a lightly censored version of the incredibly popular diss track. The "life as a video game" theme also resurfaced at the end of the show, with Lamar yelling "Game Over!" as the same words appeared in lights across the stadium.</p><p>Drake has yet to make a statement about the halftime performance. Lamar's rival was <a href="https://athlonsports.com/entertainment/drake-kendrick-lamar-reaction-halftime-show-super-bowl-beef" rel="nofollow ">reportedly out of the country</a> during the Super Bowl.</p>
