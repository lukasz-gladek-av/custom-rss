                <p>Amazon recently launched an updated lineup of its popular Kindle ereaders, and for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> many of these are now seeing generous price cuts. The brand-new <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Amazon-Kindle-Colorsoft-Signature-Edition/dp/B0CN3XR57P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Colorsoft</a> is still full price, but now is a great time to pick up the revised <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CTMS6KG9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a>, as they’re both down to their lowest price ever. A trade-in offer is also available, which gets you <strong>20% off select Kindles</strong> when trading in your old device.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-glare-free/dp/B0CFPJYX7P?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite (16GB)</a> is on sale for $130 (was $160), and it might be the most enticing offer of the bunch. With a seven-inch display, weeks of battery life, and improved hardware resulting in 25% faster page turns, it should provide for an incredibly smooth reading experience. An adjustable front light ensures your pages are always easy to see, so whether you're out in the sun or curled up in bed, your Kindle Paperwhite is a great companion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404115-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-10-33-am-5554.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404115" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404115-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-10-33-am-5554.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404115"></a><figcaption>Kindle and Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4404115-mixcollage-22-nov-2024-10-33-am-5554.jpg"></figure><p>You’ll also find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Amazon-Kindle-Paperwhite-Signature/dp/B0C8RR4WN3?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> on sale for $155 (was $200). Along with more storage (32GB compared to 16GB), it comes with an auto-adjusting front light and support for wireless charging. Beyond that, the two are largely the same.</p><p>Other great deals include the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle/dp/B0CTMS6KG9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle</a> for $85 (was $110) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Kindle-Kids/dp/B0CNVBQK38?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle Kids</a> for $95 (was $130). These don’t feature front lights that are as adjustable as the Paperwhite lineup, but they still get you weeks of battery life and a vibrant 300ppi display--though it's slightly smaller at six inches. The Kids version bundles in an Amazon Kids+ subscription, which gets you access to a large collection of children’s books, graphic novels, and more. Best of all, you’ll get a cover to protect the ereader and a two-year worry-free guarantee.</p><p>A few other Kindles are on sale for Black Friday, and you’ll find the best deals below.

And following a decade-long hiatus, the series returned in style last year with Armored Core 6. As a sci-fi series with mecha-based vehicular combat, Armored Core is substantially different thematically from the Souls games.</p><p>That said, Dark Souls veterans who have never played Armored Core will feel right at home in terms of the challenge. There's a deep strategic element to Armored Core, too, as part of the fun and challenge comes from outfitting the eponymous Armored Core (your mecha suit). Like other recent From Software games, Armored Core 6 has some incredible and thoroughly imposing bosses to topple.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Armored Core 6: Pilot's Manual</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/3869931272?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$32.60 (was $45)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Published by Future Press, Armored Core 6: Pilot's Manual is an extremely useful resource for new and returning Armored Core players.

game.</p><p>Players will even be able to begin earning rewards for MLB 25 as they play through Season 4 with the new Now &amp; Later MLB The Show Packs, with each Now &amp; Later pack able to be redeemed for a regular pack in MLB The Show 25.</p><p>The developer also teased a number of improvements coming in the next installment of the franchise, including deeper player journeys in Road to the Show, new elements of Diamond Dynasty that will replace Sets and Seasons, and improved Franchise trade metrics and offseason play. The gameplay is also set for a bit of a refresh, with MLB 25 expanding on quick-time events, defensive AI, and updated pathing for more engaging gameplay in the moment.</p><p>We can expect to hear more about MLB 25 and what it will be bringing to the franchise in the lead up to its release, which can be expected around the start of the Major League Baseball season in March next year.</p>

                <p>Strange Scaffold released its follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/el-paso-elsewhere-review-you-keep-going/1900-6418120/" data-ref-id="1900-6418120">El Paso Elsewhere</a> , <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-covert-espionage-fps-i-am-your-beast-revealed-by-el-paso-elsewhere-dev/1100-6524036/" data-ref-id="1100-6524036">I Am Your Beast</a>, back in September. It launched with a short-but-sweet campaign, but with the debut of a new free update today, it now has nine additional levels for players to check out.</p><p>The new additions are part of the Support Group pack that serves as an epilogue to the game's story. I Am Your Beast puts players in control of Alphonse Harding, an ex-secret agent who is sick and tired of being called back in to do one more job. When Harding finally turns down his former employers at the Cover Operations Initiative, the agency sends multiple operatives to kill him.</p><p>According to Strange Scaffold, the epilogue will feature traumatized Cover Operatives Imitative agents who act as the unreliable narrators for the expansion. That may explain why players suddenly have superhuman strength and abilities that include the power to literally punch someone's head off of their body.</p><p>Strange Scaffold also released a new trailer for I Am Your Beast that shares some of the glowing reviews and accolades the game has received so far.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mWOwtXZW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/58mWOwtXZW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>I Am Your Beast is currently only available on PC, but an iOS port is coming in January 2025.</p>
