                <p>Two years ago this week, Bethesda's interstellar action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">Starfield</a> debuted on Xbox Series X|S and PC. The first major expansion, Shattered Space, was released in September 2024. Now, a new expansion may be on the horizon. Bethesda's official Starfield social media account shared an anniversary message for fans that appears to include what may be the name of the next DLC.</p><p>If that went by too fast for you to catch all of the letters, the two words appear to be "Terran Armada."</p><p>The name Terran Armada suggests a faction with direct links to Earth. In the lore of Starfield, Earth became uninhabitable, which led to humanity's colonization of other star systems. Humans haven't had many reasons to go back to their home world since, but perhaps that will change.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Starfield lead creative producer Tim Lab <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-getting-a-second-story-dlc-and-more/1100-6534318/" data-ref-id="1100-6534318">confirmed that there will be a new expansion</a> while sharing some additional information.</p><p>"We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features that players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story," said Lab. "I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights."</p><p>There have also been persistent rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-could-come-to-ps5-next-spring-report/1100-6533651/" data-ref-id="1100-6533651">Starfield may come to PlayStation 5</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-leaker-claims/1100-6534121/" data-ref-id="1100-6534121">even to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the future. For now, those reports remain unconfirmed.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
