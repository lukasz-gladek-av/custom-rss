                <p dir="ltr">Bethesda finally revealed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">launched The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, one of the games industry's worst-kept secrets for months, and caused a few ripples in the mod community by <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">publishing a post</a> that said Oblivion Remastered mods aren't supported. That's a slightly vague statement, as it only means that Bethesda has no plans to develop and support an official Oblivion Remastered creation kit like the studio did for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/">Skyrim</a> or some of its other games.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Oblivion Remastered still allows for<i> </i>mods, even without a creation kit. You can download and run Oblivion mods or try to make your own without any kind of penalty or fear of a ban. The game just might not run properly, hence Bethesda recommending players disable mods if their game crashes for no other discernible reason.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever issues may or may not be present with early mods, the Oblivion Remastered mod scene is already lighting up. NexusMods has a handful of creations, including one that<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> restores the color shading from Oblivion's original release</a>, one to turn the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/15" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">desktop icon</a> into the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">Adoring Fan</a>, and one that makes a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/31" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">longsword deal 10,000 damage</a>, because why not. Early downloaders have also reported no issues getting these mods to work, and that may be due to how Bethesda and Virtuous made Oblivion Remastered. It's a hybrid of sorts, one that's built in Unreal Engine 5, but that still runs on the original Oblivion engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As of the time of publication, modders are uncertain about the ease of porting old Oblivion mods to the remaster, and whether it's even possible, as questions persist regarding how these changes might interact with Unreal Engine 5. However, they have discovered that it's possible to open Oblivion Remastered's files in the Oblivion Construction Set, a mod creation and management tool that lets creators modify the original game's files. Some modders said that, even while they wait to figure out how to create new assets and enable mods, they should still be able to work with existing assets--for example, tweaking existing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-classes-in-oblivion-remastered-all-elder-scrolls-4-classes/1100-6531030/" data-ref-id="1100-6531030">Oblivion classes</a> instead of making brand-new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">Once there's a greater consensus about how Oblivion Remastered mods work, we'll update with detailed steps for how to install them and a roundup of the best ones worth downloading.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, if you're just getting started in Oblivion for the first time or need a refresh, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered walkthrough</a> for everything from tips on combat skills to how to navigate factions.</p>

                <p>Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-announces-oblivion-stream-amid-elder-scrolls-remaster-leaks/1100-6530986/" data-ref-id="1100-6530986">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> overlaps with the fan-made remake mod Skyblivion, Bethesda still acknowledged the modders' efforts by giving them code for the new remaster.</p><p>Skyblivion is an upcoming project by the modding group TESRenewal. Its goal is to remake the 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion entirely within The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's game engine. It's an impressive effort that has been in the works for several years. In February, TESRenewal suggested that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">could be released this year</a>. Shortly thereafter, rumors of an official Oblivion remaster and remake began to swirl.</p><p>As it became clear that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was real and launching soon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize said</a>, "for the community it's a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year," of the situation. Earlier today, Bethesda and Virtuos officially announced and released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Rather than issuing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">cease and desist</a> for Skyblivion, Bethesda acknowledged the team's work and provided the members of TESRenewal with free codes for the remaster.</p><p>Skyblivion is expected to be released sometime in 2025 and will be available on PC to owners of Skyrim: Special Edition, the original Oblivion, and its DLCs. The Elder Scrolls IV: Remastered is available now for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you're playing Oblivion for the first time or revisiting this RPG for the first time in years, you should check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">GameSpot's walkthrough</a> for help in guiding you through the adventure.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier today, fans of The Elder Scrolls were delighted not only to officially learn of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-new-and-different-in-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>'s existence, but also that the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/"> game is available now on consoles and PC</a>. However, those who watched the Bethesda livestream who aren't familiar with Cyrodiil and its inhabitants may have had a question: Who the heck was that Adoring Fan?</p><p dir="ltr">In Oblivion, the Adoring Fan is a commoner who lives in the Imperial City and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL4X8fZViU">lavishes praise on you</a> once they become the Grand Champion in the Arena. He's technically a "Follower" in that he'll follow you around the world, but unlike other Followers, his contribution to combat is to run and hide from enemies--which sometimes attracts more in the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751"></a><figcaption>The Adoring Fan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Adoring Fan has gained notoriety in the Elder Scrolls community due to his zealous devotion to following the player around, which can lead to some hilarious situations--if you tell him to leave you alone while standing on top of a mountain, for example, the Fan heads back to the Imperial City via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRi6GBF5zB0&amp;pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv">most direct route possible</a>. He's so notorious, in fact, that Bethesda created a successor to the Adoring Fan in Starfield, though the spacefaring version can only be recruited if you choose the "Hero Worshipped" trait.</p><p dir="ltr">The Oblivion remaster retains much of what made the 2006 RPG so beloved, including the silly bits of dialogue that players still remember today. The remaster was developed by Virtuos Studio, built using Unreal Engine 5, and includes 4K resolution, 60-frames-per second performance, and dynamic time-of-day and weather effects, among other improvements.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is available now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.

This includes the class system, which allows you to further customize your character by giving them a specific specialization. The class you choose also determines your favored attributes and the major skills your character has access to. While you can create a custom class that suits your exact needs in Cyrodiil, the preset classes offer some great options.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available classes in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered as well as our picks for the best overall classes in each of the three categories. If you want a more in-depth look at the classes or a broad overview of the game altogether, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough of Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><h2 id="All_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">All Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>There are three main categories that every class in the game falls into, and each category features seven classes. This gives you a total of 21 classes to choose from. You're able to choose your class after you make your way through the Sanctum area in the tutorial of Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>The class you choose should largely be based on the race and Birthsign you selected earlier in the game, and you'll initially be recommended a class based on those choices. However, you don't have to choose that class or even choose a class in the same category. You're entirely free to make a jack-of-all-trades character that can wreak all sorts of havoc throughout Cyrodiil.</p><p>Here's a list of all 21 classes in Oblivion Remastered:</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><ul><li>Warrior</li><li>Barbarian</li><li>Crusader</li><li>Knight</li><li>Archer</li><li>Scout</li><li>Rogue</li></ul><p><strong>Mage</strong></p><ul><li>Mage</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>Battlemage</li><li>Healer</li><li>Spellsword</li><li>Witchhunter</li><li>Nightblade</li></ul><p><strong>Stealth</strong></p><ul><li>Thief</li><li>Agent</li><li>Acrobat</li><li>Assassin</li><li>Monk</li><li>Pilgrim</li><li>Bard</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730"></a><figcaption>You're able to edit your class and other character options before the tutorial ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png"></figure><p>Your initial class choice can be altered before you leave the Sewers in Oblivion Remastered. Right as you go through the exit door, you're able to change your class, Birthsign, and other character identity options. So if you don't like your class within the first few minutes of testing it, you can change it before you get out into the world of Oblivion.</p><h2 id="Best_Combat_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Combat Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Now that we've reviewed all the classes in each category, it's time to determine which one is the best in each category. First up is the Combat category, which is mainly going to feature your attack-focused classes. The classes in Combat represent two forms of combat, melee and ranged, as well as some subclasses based around those combat types.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735"></a><figcaption>The Combat classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png"></figure><p>If you're a beginner in Oblivion Remastered and you're just looking to stick with a basic class, choose from these three: <strong>Warrior, Archer, Rogue</strong>. These are classic RPG classes, and they focus on a specific playstyle that's easy to grasp.</p><p>The Warrior excels in hand-to-hand combat while wearing heavy armor and has plenty of strength and endurance. You'll mainly wield a melee weapon with a shield, unless you're using a two-handed weapon, like a Battle Axe, and your character will always be able to tank some hits from enemies before you need a healing potion.</p><p>As for the Archer class, this utilizes a bow and arrows to attack enemies from range. Light and medium armor are your friends, so you can keep your stamina up to fire off more shots. You could also choose the Rogue class if you want to use a bow, but Rogues generally use light melee weapons and attack from the shadows. Rogues also excel in thievery and talking their way out of sticky situations while in dialogue.</p><p>While those are the basic Combat classes to pick, if you want something more advanced, go with either<strong> the</strong><strong> Crusader or the Knight</strong>. The Crusader is granted the ability to heal yourself and allies while still wielding large melee weapons, giving you the option to use a couple of playstyles simultaneously. The Knight also uses melee weapons, but they specialize in persuasion through the personality attribute.</p><p>Combat is arguably the most basic of the three categories of classes in Oblivion Remastered, but there are some great options here for beginners and veterans.</p><h2 id="Best_Magic_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Magic Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>As you might expect, the Magic category is all about the art of magicka in Oblivion Remastered. These classes are centered around all forms of magicka, but you'll also gain some bonuses in alchemy for any potions you want to brew down the line.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741"></a><figcaption>The Magic classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png"></figure><p>Arguably the best class in Magic is <strong>Spellsword</strong>, which is also one of the best attacking classes in the game. You gain access to a number of offensive magic skills, including Destruction, Illusion, and Alteration, as well as the Blade and Block skills. Spellswords also have proficiency in heavy armor, which isn't common for a magic class.</p><p>While you'll want to stick with magicka a majority of the time, these skills do allow the Spellsword to whip out a melee weapon every now and again during close range encounters. The <strong>Nightblade</strong> class also features some of these characteristics, but is more of a glass cannon due to its proficiencies in light armor and acrobatics. Of course, if you like light armor more than heavy armor, the Nightblade might be the way to go.</p><p>If neither Spellsword nor Nightblade excites you, then the next best options are <span>either<strong> Sorcerer</strong></span><strong> or Mage</strong>. Both of these classes are a little more on the generic side of things when it comes to magicka, but they're both incredibly powerful. The Mage has access to most forms of magicka in Oblivion Remastered, while the Sorcerer utilizes heavy armor and alchemy to reliably stay healthy.</p><p>The Mage is more of a veteran class choice, while the Sorcerer is better for beginners, but both are viable if you're looking to solely deal damage with magicka.</p><h2 id="Best_Stealth_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Stealth Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the most versatile set of classes in Oblivion Remastered. The Stealth category mainly focuses on the melee and ranged combat types, but the classes themselves offer a number of different benefits outside of combat. You'll gain skills in acrobatics, sneak, speed, speechcraft, and more that make life easier when exploring Cyrodiil and interacting with its many inhabitants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743"></a><figcaption>The Stealth classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png"></figure><p>In our opinion, the two best classes in Stealth are <strong>Assassin and Thief</strong>. Both are somewhat similar in regard to what attributes and skills you gain, but the Assassin focuses more on combat, while the Thief is a class useful for dealing with NPCs and exploration.</p><p>The Assassin class features speed and intelligence as its favored attributes, gaining skills in sneak, acrobatics, light armor, marksman, alchemy, blade, and security. You'll be able to sneak efficiently, deal damage from afar or up close with great precision, and even partake in some alchemy right out of the gate. With how powerful sneaking and ranged combat is in Oblivion Remastered, Assassin just might be the best overall class in the game.</p><p>However, if you're more worried about exploration rather than the combat, the Thief needs to be your pick. Its favored attributes are speed and agility, while it adds the speechcraft and mercantile skills in exchange for blade and alchemy from the Assassin's list of skills. The speechcraft and mercantile come in especially handy when dealing with NPCs during exploration or quests, which can save you a ton of time in the long run.</p><p>If neither Assassin nor Thief floats your boat, though, go with the <strong>Pilgrim or the Bard</strong>. Bards are arguably the best class for persuasion and dealing with NPCs, and the Pilgrim is a great all-around class for either melee or ranged combat as well as exploration.</p>
