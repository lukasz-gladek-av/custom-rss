                <p>Lego's brick-built Game Boy replica is bound to be one of the most popular gift ideas for retro gaming enthusiasts this holiday. The 421-piece recreation of Nintendo's legendary 1989 handheld is wonderfully designed, fun to build, and looks great on a display shelf. It comes with two buildable games, The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land, which can be loaded into the handheld's Game Pak slot. Swappable lenticular screens recreate moments from each game as well as the Game Boy's boot screen. The $60 price tag makes it one of the most affordable Lego sets made for adults. The Lego Game Boy launched October 1 at the <a href="https://sovrn.co/10gqen0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Store</a> and major retailers, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/pgr7z89" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/modu1on" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>.</p><p>I spoke with Lego Group Senior Designer Carl Merriam over email about the design of the newest Lego Nintendo display model. Questions and answers are attributed to GameSpot and Lego, respectively.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>I've always been fascinated by the logistics of designing a LEGO set. How do you start? How do designers determine how many pieces each build should have? How do you choose the shapes and sizes of the pieces? Did the Game Boy go through multiple iterations before finding the right design? Can you provide a general overview of how a designer gets from the idea to a finished product?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We start with an idea. For the LEGO Game Boy the idea was: “Let’s make a LEGO set celebrating the original Nintendo Game Boy.” From there we built several different versions using existing LEGO Bricks. While doing that we determined that we would need a few new LEGO elements. We started developing the new LEGO elements and built many, many, many more versions of the LEGO Game Boy. Eventually we found combinations of pieces that looked like the reference, are stable when built and most importantly are fun to put together.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594904"></a><figcaption>Lego Game Boy 72046</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594904-legogameboydisplay.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Does the LEGO Game Boy set use any unique pieces not found in other LEGO sets?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: We developed a special 4x4 curved LEGO brick for the corner with the speaker, as well as a 6x8 tile for the back plate and a 2x4 bracket to build in the buttons. Many of the other pieces were existing bricks. The start and select buttons are tires, which originally launched in 1969, the A and B buttons are minifigure hats, AND we even managed to include a classic 2x4 brick inside.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What did Nintendo bring to this design, in terms of knowledge, advice, and secrets?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: We work closely with Nintendo on all LEGO Nintendo products, and the Game Boy was no different. One of the most fun parts was working with Nintendo on what easter eggs to include and what game screens to replicate from Super Mario Land and The Legend of Zelda: Links Awakening. Nintendo provided both design input on the build, as well as reference images of the actual hardware components.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>How important was it to make this set not only look like the Game Boy, but also feel like an accurate replica of a handheld device? At the same time, aspects such as visible studs on the D-pad make it evident this is a LEGO set. I imagine it's critical for a replica to still look like a LEGO set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: During the development of this set, we built many versions with different levels of functionality. Given the size of the original Game Boy, we were presented with the opportunity to figure out creative ways to include physical functions into the build. During this process, we found that it was possible to make all the controls interactive. My attention then shifted to trying to replicate the haptics of the actual hardware. I started to focus on each of the controls, the buttons, dials and power switch — testing different versions of the build to find the closest simulation of the sensation of holding a real Game Boy.</p><p dir="ltr">The studs on the D-pad are included for two reasons:</p><p dir="ltr">1. We like to include studs to add LEGO DNA, so you can see it is a LEGO model.</p><p dir="ltr">2. That combination of LEGO bricks (with the studs showing) allows the D-pad to be able to tilt as it does on the real Game Boy. Recessing it into the LEGO Game Boy and adding tiles to cover the studs was one of the possible design choices, but that would remove the functionality.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Are the buildable cartridges the same size as actual Game Boy games? If so, can the cartridge slot hold real games?</p><p dir="ltr"><b>LEGO</b>: Unfortunately not. The real Game Pak is slightly too big to fit into the LEGO Game Boy set.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594905"></a><figcaption>Lego's building set is a near 1:1 recreation of Nintendo's Game Boy DMG.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594905-legogameboy2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Were Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land always the cartridge choices, or were other games in the running? What's your personal favorite Game Boy game?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: After looking at several different games, we landed on these two first-party games to celebrate our longstanding partnership with Nintendo.</p><p dir="ltr">Link’s Awakening is my personal favorite Game Boy game. I have a vivid memory of calling the Nintendo hotline for some help getting the Hookshot while playing it.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>What's the smallest detail on this set that you're most proud of? What was the biggest challenge you faced?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO:</strong> I used all my powers as both a veteran LEGO designer and a lifelong LEGO fan to make this set as excellent as possible, so there are lots of favorite things to choose from. If I have to pick just one... it has to be the power switch function. While working on this set, I focused on replicating all the haptics of the real Game Boy as closely as possible. I tried to make all the buttons press-able and the dials turn-able, but getting that power switch to slide and click like the real one... that is my favorite feature.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest challenge I faced was trying to replicate the dimensions of the real Game Boy. The closest LEGO dimensions to the form factor of the real Game Boy are: 11 studs wide by 18 studs long by 3.6 studs deep. Dimensions for LEGO Bricks tend to be in even numbers, so finding the right combination of elements to put the screen and screen surrounding in the center of the device was a real brain teaser.</p><hr><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: </strong>Besides the Game Boy, what's your favorite LEGO Nintendo set?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>LEGO</strong>: It has to be the LEGO Super Mario Desert Pokey (71363). I love this set, it is so amazing how well it replicates the interaction with the Desert Pokey from the Super Mario games in real life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901" data-ratio="0.668" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594901"></a><figcaption>The Lego Game Boy includes three lenticular screen panels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4594901-legogameboylenticular.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lego Game Boy is the eighth <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DX3J6MT7,B0DRW6K649,B0CYM2V9FS,B0BXQ3M8JH,B0B2Y3WNH4,B0DF857JZ9,B08FCW3SB7,B09FMVDHDM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">officially licensed Nintendo building set designed for adults</a> and the second to release in 2025.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is filled with quests that require you to get things back up and running topside to help those down below get prepared to take the world back from the ARC. One such quest called Straight Record comes from Celeste, who sends you topside in the Dam Battlegrounds to turn on an old EMP. This task will require you to not only find the old EMP but also turn on multiple switches to get it going again--so if you're struggling to find them, we've got you covered. Here's how to complete the Straight Record quest in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find the old EMP trap for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>Completing the Straight Record quest does not require you to extract. As such, feel free to spawn into the raid using a free loadout to avoid any loss of resources in the event that you perish from enemies or other players while trying to get it finished.</p><p>Your first goal in Straight Record is to find the old EMP trap in the Victory Ridge area. This spot is located in the upper left side of the map just slightly southwest of the West Broken Ridge POI. Reaching this location shouldn't prove too difficult, though you may need to fend off a raider or two also doing the quest--or work together, if that's more your speed.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596490,1300-4596491" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596490-arcraiders_20251104141541.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596491-arcraiders_20251104141554.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive, you'll spot a tall, thin machine with wires wrapped around it. This is the old EMP, and you'll simply need to interact with it to discover that it's not powered on yet. This will begin the next part of the quest.</p><h2>Where to find the power switches for the Straight Record quest</h2><p>There are three power switches you'll need to turn on before you can activate the old EMP. They're all close by, though, so you won't need to venture far to get them turned on.</p><p>The first switch can be found on a small cliff just north of the old EMP. You can walk around the outside of the cliff to reach it. Interact with it to turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596492"></a><figcaption>First switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596492-arcraiders_20251104141727.jpg"></figure><p>The second switch is located just east of the old EMP on a collapsed structure.

You'll find it directly next to a tree, so go ahead and turn it on.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4596493"></a><figcaption>Third switch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596493-arcraiders_20251104141753.jpg"></figure><p>With all of the switches found, you're ready to return to the old EMP. Interact with it once more to complete the quest.</p><p>With the quest complete, you can decide whether you'd like to go loot some more before extracting, or simply head to the North Complex Elevator to the northeast to get the hell out of dodge before any other players come try to take you out.

                <p>Blizard has announced the official dates for when tickets will go on sale for BlizzCon next year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-skips-2025-but-will-return-in-2026-after-two-years-off/1100-6530016/">when it returns to the Anaheim Convention Center in September 2026</a>. Early-Bird tickets will go on sale starting <strong>November 7 at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET</strong>, and are priced at $250 for both days of the fan expo. This includes taxes and fees, and it comes with commemorative in-game items as a bonus.</p><p>These tickets will be sold while supplies last, after which, Blizzard will sell a standard ticket weekend pass for $290 starting November 18. This is $10 cheaper than the standard tickets sold for BlizzCon 2023, and it also offers full two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon on both Saturday and Sunday.</p><p>Fans looking to upgrade their experience can purchase a $500 ticket to BlizzCon Charity Night, an exclusive event with Blizzard developers, artists, and community representatives. This does not include access to the convention, and proceeds will go to the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p><p>There'll also be the Darkmoon Faire After Hours experience, an optional add-on that grants you entry to an exclusive three-hour event on the Saturday of BlizzCon. Priced at $90 all-in, a BlizzCon Pass is required to purchase this add-on. <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">All passes will be sold through TIXR</a>.</p><h2>What to expect from BlizzCon 2026</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4597004-blizzcon-2026.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4597004-blizzcon-2026.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597004"></a><figcaption>BlizzCon 2026</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4597004-blizzcon-2026.jpg"></figure><p>BlizzCon is where Blizzard makes its biggest announcements, and while the company is keeping things quiet for now, it has confirmed that it is planning some "major" reveals during its opening ceremony. Beyond that, the convention will see the return of the Blizzard Arcade, developer panels, and hands-on gameplay sessions for games like World of Warcraft, Diablo IV, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal. Presumably, these titles will have new content revealed for them, explaining their presence on the showfloor.</p><p>Last year, Blizzard said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2024-canceled-but-blizzard-has-big-warcraft-plans-in-store/1100-6522953/">it had decided to not hold a BlizzCon 2024 "after careful consideration."</a> The show has been held on and off again throughout the 2020s, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. BlizzCon 2022 was a digital-only presentation, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2023-tickets-start-at-300-first-show-details-revealed/1100-6515587/">BlizzCon 2023</a> was a traditional in-person event. Since then, Blizzard has skipped in-person BlizzCon events for 2024 and 2025.</p>

You may also spot a few Apricot or Lemon trees in this area, making it a great spot for obtaining all these fruits at once.</p><p>As a side note, even if you're just on Scrappy's second-tier upgrade, make sure you stock up on a lot of Apricots while looting, as you'll need a lot more for his fourth-tier upgrade.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Prickly_Pears">Where to find Prickly Pears</h3><p>Prickly Pears are found near cacti, which can be found all over the maps in Arc Raiders. However, the best spots to search tend to be on the outer perimeters of the Dam Battlegrounds and Buried City maps, especially in the northern part of the former and all along the southern section of the latter.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596918,1300-4596920" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596918-share_20251105_0434160-copy.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596920-share_20251105_0435380.jpeg"></figure><p>You'll find numerous cactus spawns all across these outer sections, though actual Prickly Pear spawns are far less generous. Just keep at it, though, and you'll eventually find enough to make Scrappy happy.</p><h3 id="Where_to_find_Mushrooms">Where to find Mushrooms</h3><p>Mushrooms are likely to be the hardest resource to find for Scrappy's upgrades. These spawn in damp areas across multiple maps, but they're quite contested since everyone needs so many of them. It's best to be ready for a fight if you're searching in any area known for Mushroom spawns.</p><p>Generally, your best bet for finding Mushrooms will be on Dam Battlegrounds. You can catch them growing on trees throughout the swamp area on the left side of the map, but some better locations to look include the Wreckage in the southeast and inside the Water Treatment Center.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4596911,1300-4596912" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596911-share_20251105_0434432.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4596912-share_20251105_0434421.jpeg"></figure><p>For the Water Treatment Center, head to the interior hallways and follow the pipes. Mushrooms will often be growing beneath or on these pipes, so you're likely to find at least one per visit if you're searching thoroughly enough. Again, however, remember you may run into other raiders here, so don't let your guard down.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p>New images for a "Cross-Buy" system have been spotted on the PlayStation Store, sparking speculation that Sony might be looking to introduce cross-platform purchasing of some kind in the future. The graphics for this were spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/yAmethxst/status/1985841552288104906" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amethxst</a> on X and corroborated by reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/du-cross-buy-ps5-pc-en-preparation-chez-playstation-voici-les-resultats-de-notre-enquete-60757" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>.</p><p>According to Dealabs, the Cross-Buy tags were added by Sony all the way back in June 2025, but what the company's definition of this term could be is unknown. For comparison, Microsoft offers a cross-buy feature where Xbox games can be played on PC, (sometimes) through cloud streaming, or anything else that it considers to be an Xbox--like the ROG Ally X handheld.</p><p>Could Sony offer a similar deal, considering that it has made more of its first-party games available on PC after a period of exclusivity on PS5? That's unknown, but it is worth pointing out that Sony previously used Cross-Buy as a term for games sold during the PS Vita handheld era. If PS3 or PS4 owners purchased certain games back then, they'd get the PS Vita for free and vice versa, allowing them access to one game over multiple platforms. The service was eventually phased out, but at the time, it was a major draw for PS Vita owners.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">With a PS5 Portable handheld also rumored to be in development</a>, having some form of cross-buy that links both home and handheld consoles could be a way to drum up interest in that potential hardware.</p><p>While it remains to be seen what form Cross-Buy takes--if Sony pushes ahead with it--fans of the PS Portal handheld can look forward to a major update for that streaming device. After a year in beta, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps-portal-update-adds-full-cloud-streaming-two-years-after-launch/1100-6535944/">Cloud Streaming for the PS Portal</a> has officially "arrived" and is open to all PS Plus Premium subscribers. The game library for Cloud Streaming has expanded to almost 3,000 games, and several new features have been added to help users play games in different streaming modes.</p>
