                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> is one of multiple projects in the works at CD Projekt Red, and now some new information about the game has come to light. Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith has revealed that the sequel will feature a brand-new city that he described as "like Chicago gone wrong."</p><p>Appearing in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REDstreams broadcast</a>, Pondsmith said he recently visited the developers and said he spoke with the environment team to see how the new city was coming together. Whatever this place is, it will be on top of the next iteration of Night City from Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"There's another city we visit--I'm not telling you any more than that but there's another city we visit. And Night City is still there. But I remember looking at it and going, yeah I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work. And it doesn't feel like Blade Runner, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, 'Yeah, I can see this working,'" he said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/contact-me-cyberpunk-creator-mike-pondsmith-tells-keanu-reeves-he-has-ways-to-bring-johnny-silverhand-back-from-the-dead-for-cyberpunk-2?utm_source=instagram,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>.</p><h2><strong>Could Keanu Reeves come back?</strong></h2><p>Also during the interview, Pondsmith broached the subject of whether or not Keanu Reeves (Johnny Silverhand) could return in Cyberpunk 2. Pondsmith said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-would-come-back-for-cyberpunk-2/1100-6534536/" data-ref-id="1100-6534536">saw the headlines</a> where Reeves himself said he would be keen to come back and called on Reeves to pick up the phone.</p><p>"I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again. I have ways to do that, Keanu. Contact me," Pondsmith said.</p><p>Silverhand is a former rockstar who appears in the game in the form of a digital engram long after his physical body dies. The character's fate at the end of Cyberpunk 2077 can depend on the ending that players receive. Given that, it appears possible that he could return in Cyberpunk 2, but that's far from a guarantee that it would happen, as that would depend on a countless combination of factors.</p><p>As for CD Projekt's other upcoming games, the company is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> and is co-producing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">remake of the original Witcher game</a> with developer Fool's Theory.</p>

                <p>Without the Witcher novels by Andrezj Sapkowski, there wold be no hit series on Netlflix or even the video games that revitalized the property a decade ago. According to Sapkowski, he's happy with his arrangements with CD Projekt Red, even though the devs don't ask him many questions anymore.</p><p>While promoting his latest novel (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-author-has-an-excellent-deal-with-the-witcher-4-devs-but-its-rare-for-cd-projekt-to-ask-him-for-advice-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), Sapkowski noted that CD Projekt Red used to approach him about additional info about the characters and the world he created. Now, he says it's "so rare" for CD Projekt Red to ask him any advice.</p><p>When Sapkowski originally signed withe CD Projekt Red to let them adapt his novels, he took an upfront payment instead of royalties. Sapkowski subsequently sued the developer to get a better deal after the blockbuster success of The Witcher 3. Terms weren't disclosed, but the case was settled. Now, Sapokowski describes his relationship with the devs in more glowing terms.</p><p>"The contracts between me and the game people are excellent right now," said Sapokowski. "Let's hope it stays that way."</p><p>Netflix recently debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/see-liam-hemsworth-as-geralt-in-new-witcher-season-4-trailer/1100-6535277/" data-ref-id="1100-6535277">The Witcher Season 4</a>, which will have a fifth and final season to wrap up the show. Meanwhile CD Projekt Red put <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/" data-ref-id="5000-561041">The Witcher 4</a> into active development last year. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a>, and it looked impressive. However, the developers subsequently described the demo as a technical demonstration, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">rather than a preview of the game itself</a>, which doesn't currently have a release date. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is also expected to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-3s-last-patch-is-delayed/1100-6535045/" data-ref-id="1100-6535045">one final patch in 2026</a> that will enable mod access on consoles.</p>

                <p>Video game remakes and remasters have attracted impressive player numbers and generated substantial consumer spending, research shows, although full-on remakes may have a slight edge.</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis tracked data from January 2024 to September 2025, looking at 42 re-releases (specifically, 15 remakes and 27 remasters). These releases accumulated 72.4 million players across Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam, with consumers spending $1.4 billion from purchasing these games and related in-game monetisation.</p><p>Overall, the average remake produced 2.2 times the amount of consumer spending as remasters did during that time frame. For instance, while the Gears of War: Reloaded remaster had a similar peak monthly active user count as the Silent Hill 2 remake and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the latter two titles far surpassed Gears of War in consumer spending.</p><p>The one outlier is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which peaked at $180 million in consumer spending and pulled in 7 million monthly active users, far and above every other remaster and remake included in the study.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4595155"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4595155-image%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>The data goes to show the power of a popular IP like The Elder Scrolls, even though overall, remakes resulted in higher consumer spending and player engagement. This research also highlights the differences between remasters and remakes, both of which are prevalent strategies employed by major game publishers.</p><p>While remakes might yield greater returns and player counts, they are more costly and take longer to develop, as they are built from the ground up. A benefit of remakes is that core gameplay can be completely refigured to be up-to-date with modern sensibilities. Remasters, on the other hand, are typically fresh coats of paint on existing assets and systems, requiring less time and fewer resources; however, outdated gameplay design may still be evident.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-finds-nearly-all-gamers-have-played-a-remaster-or-remake-in-last-year/1100-6534807/" data-ref-id="1100-6534807">separate report in September</a> showed that the vast majority of people who play video games have engaged with remakes or remasters, with most of them not even playing the original version of the game.</p><p>It's hard to throw a dart at a release schedule and not hit a re-release, with just this year's schedule including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">remakes of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-remake-review/1900-6418433/" data-ref-id="1900-6418433">first two Dragon Quest games</a>, along with remasters of Donkey Kong Country Returns and several Tomb Raider games.</p><p>This study from Ampere Analytics has some interesting data to chew on--it'll be interesting to see where the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-1-remake-saw-every-asset-get-attention-to-bring-it-up-to-modern-standards/1100-6535744/" data-ref-id="1100-6535744">remakes of the Halo: Combat Evolved campaign</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-launch-by-march-2026-ubisoft-says/1100-6531547/" data-ref-id="1100-6531547">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> would fall on that graphic.</p>

                <p>Netflix's The Witcher is heading into its final seasons, and not all fans are happy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-says-he-was-reluctant-to-take-over-for-henry-cavill/1100-6535733/" data-ref-id="1100-6535733">With Liam Hemsworth taking over as Geralt from Henry Cavill in Season 4</a>, some viewers have criticized the show for straying from Andrzej Sapkowski's beloved books. But showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich wants fans to remember that there’s more than one way to enjoy The Witcher.</p><p>"One of the things that I've talked a lot to the author about and a lot to fans about is that the books still exist. No one is taking the books away. No one is taking the video games away," she said, talking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-witcher-wont-make-game-of-thrones-ending-mistake-netflix-3276622/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>. </p><p>Hissrich also stressed that the Netflix series will not make the same mistakes as the Game of Thrones adaptation. "We lucked out because I said very early on, 'We're not going to go past the books,'" she explained. Seasons 4 and 5, filmed back-to-back, will adapt the final three novels: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. Geralt's origin story was explored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-crossroads-of-ravens-novel-box-sets-reading-order/1100-6532972/" data-ref-id="1100-6532972">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, which was released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Ravens-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski/dp/0316597732?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back in late September</a>. </p><p>"We lean so hardcore into fantasy at the end in wonderful ways that Sapkowski introduced us to. So we knew the stories that we needed to end with," she added. </p><p>The showrunner acknowledged the challenges of balancing fans of the books, the video games, and new viewers who discovered the world through the Netflix show. "You have book fans, you have video game fans, and then you have fans that knew nothing about this world until the show existed. The truth is, we can't choose one audience," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher/">The Witcher video games</a>, developed by CD Projekt Red, have been hugely influential, offering players a richly detailed world and an alternate take on Geralt’s adventures that differ from both the books and the show.</p><p>Hissrich framed the Netflix series as one version of a larger universe. "I think everyone can have their version of The Witcher, and this is this version," she said. Season 4 premiered on October 30, while fans can continue to explore Geralt’s story in Sapkowski’s novels or through the critically acclaimed Witcher games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, which many consider a modern gaming masterpiece.</p><p>While we're still a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">few years away from The Witcher 4</a>, the footage that has been released so far <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">looked really impressive</a>.  </p>

                <p>With The Simpsons taking over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> battle royale, we've been duking it out on a new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield, the home of the long-running sitcom's titular family. Naturally, the island is full of references to the show, both big and small, and you can earn a healthy chunk of XP toward the new Simpsons-themed battle pass by finding some of them. On top of that, we've got a set of story quests to start us off, as well as some found quests that literally pop out of treasure chests occasionally.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a little less hand-holding than usual with these quests, since Fortnite doesn't even tell you what a lot of them are--sometimes you find out a quest exists only after you finish it. But we got you covered. Read on for explanations for all of Fortnite's new Simpsons quests.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_complete_the_Fortnite_x_Simpsons_nuclear_power_plant_event">How to complete the Fortnite x Simpsons nuclear power plant event</a></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Hidden_Gags_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Hidden Gags quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</a></li><li><a href="#Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</a></li><li><a href="#Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</a></li><li><a href="#Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</a></li><li><a href="#Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</a></li><li><a href="#Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</a></li><li><a href="#Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</a></li><li><a href="#Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</a></li><li><a href="#Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</a></li><li><a href="#Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</a></li><li><a href="#Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</a></li><li><a href="#Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</a></li><li><a href="#Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</a></li><li><a href="#Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</a></li><li><a href="#Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</a></li><li><a href="#Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</a></li><li><a href="#Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</a></li><li><a href="#Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</a></li><li><a href="#Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</a></li><li><a href="#Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</a></li><li><a href="#Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</a></li><li><a href="#Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</a></li><li><a href="#Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</a><ul><li><a href="#Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</a></li><li><a href="#Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</a></li><li><a href="#Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</a></li><li><a href="#Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</a></li><li><a href="#Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</a></li><li><a href="#Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</a></li><li><a href="#Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</a></li><li><a href="#Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</a></li><li><a href="#Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_complete_the_Fortnite_x_Simpsons_nuclear_power_plant_event">How to complete the Fortnite x Simpsons nuclear power plant event</h2><p dir="ltr">Whenever the circle is going to close in and leave the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in the storm, the plant goes into meltdown. If you're there when this happens, you'll see an icon directing you to the plant's control room, where you'll need to enter a sequence using the three buttons--Eenie, Meenie, and Minie--to avert disaster and receive some sick loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the sequence is random each match, but you can find out what the code is by looking for these posters around the plant. Using the sequence from the poster should complete the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997" data-ratio="0.56227239621267" data-width="1373" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997"></a><figcaption>These randomized posters will tell you the code sequence for each match.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A new type of milestone this season simply tells you to find 12 "hidden gags" around the island, with no further details. All 12 tasks are listed below, with instructions for how to complete them. Each of these is worth 5k XP the first time you do them, and completing all 12 is another 20k. Some of these quests also grant stashes of loot and/or gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Springfield Town Square is a statue of the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield. You can knock the head off this statue by shooting it or hitting it with your pickaxe to complete the quest. And then you can wear the head, which will protect you from all damage the next time an enemy shoots you in the head.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</h3><p dir="ltr">In every named location, you'll find walls with a little spraycan icon on them. Opening the emote wheel while next to one of these will let you tag the wall with the El Barto spray to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</h3><p dir="ltr">Leaf rakes are lying on the ground in grassy areas all over the map. Stepping on one will make the handle fly up and hit you in the face.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</h3><p dir="ltr">In Mayor Burns' office in Burns Manor, you'll find a big red button on the large wooden desk at the center of the room. Pressing this button will release a bunch of Dober Man NPCs who will fight any hostile players who enter the area.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Donut District, you can damage the Lard Lad statue to knock the giant donut off of it--turning the donut into a large physics object that can destroy buildings and cause other havoc.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</h3><p dir="ltr">Most of the major locations have several ringing payphones you can interact with. Doing so will have Bart prank call Moe, which will grant you some gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</h3><p dir="ltr">Defeating a boss NPC--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, or Krusty the Clown--prompts Nelson to pop up and laugh at the dead baddie. Meaning defeating any boss completes this quest. Unfortunately, the bosses don't have consistent spawn locations, so it's tough to predict where to find them. But they always begin in or near one of the named locations.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</h3><p dir="ltr">You can find this cleaning solution under some dirt in the corner of the Tire Fire, just south of Evergreen Terrace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</h3><p dir="ltr">Just east of Evergreen Terrace is a large gorge with a dirt ramp next to it. Simply jump the gorge while hitting the hoop hovering above it to complete the quest. Using a car is the most obvious way to do this, but using Shockwave Grenades, Super Squishees, or Blinky fish to jump through the hoop on foot is also valid.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995"></a><figcaption>You can your squad can watch TV on the Simpsons' couch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</h3><p dir="ltr">The iconic Simpsons home is located in the center of Evergreen Terrace--you'll know you're in the right place because the Marge NPC will be hanging out there. Interact with the couch in the living room to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</h3><p dir="ltr">While you're at the Simpsons' house for the previous quest, pop into the dining room where you should find a platter of steamed ham sandwiches. Platters like this also pop up in restaurants and other homes. So if the Simpsons' house doesn't have any, try Ned Flanders' house next door.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</h3><p dir="ltr">This quest is telling you to catch a fish with a fishing rod. While there are rivers flowing all over the island, none of them is suitable for fishing. Instead, you'll need to look for swirling fishing spots in the lake next to Kamp Krusty, and in the ocean surrounding the island. Catching one Blinky fish will complete the quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</h2><p dir="ltr">The first stage of the season's story quests, Apocalypse D'oh, is live now. These quests don't give any XP on their own, but you'll receive 30k XP for every three story or found quests you complete, until you've completed 30 of them. You'll have to do these quests in order, and you can find step-by-step instructions below.</p><p dir="ltr">This set of story quests will only be available until November 10, at which time they'll be replaced with the next set of story quests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</h3><p dir="ltr">This one is as simple as it sounds. Simply visit any three different named locations, over the course of however many matches you want.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</h3><p dir="ltr">Many of the named locations around the map are filled with goofy signs that Homer has put up--like "go" signs instead of "stop" signs, or the sign that indicates it's illegal to be Ned Flanders. Destroy five of these signs, which will be marked on your UI with an exclamation point, to move on to the next quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to find one of the boss NPCs--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, and Krusty the Clown--that spawn randomly in any of the named locations, and then emote when you're close to them. Just don't emote for too long, since they'll probably start shooting at you.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you've danced with the boss, shoot it. Once you've caused 250 damage, you'll move on to the next stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</h3><p dir="ltr">The Homer NPC lives at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Just interact with Homer and choose the marked quest dialogue about the Zero Point shard he found.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer wants you to do some lobbying on his behalf before he'll give up on whatever he's trying to do with the shard. So head to Springfield Town Hall in Corruption Corners, where you'll be prompted to destroy 25 objects before the cops show up and arrest you--you'll have 90 seconds, which is plenty of time.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer also wants a Super Squishee drink, so you'll need to find one from any source, like treasure chests and Squishee machines that are found in every Qwik-E-Mart around the island--you can buy three Squishees for 300 gold from these machines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to bring Homer the Super Squishee, but you'll need to take a specific route marked by checkpoint hoops--going directly to him by any other path won't count. You'll have four minutes from the moment you enter a Kwik-E-Mart or pick up a Squishee to complete the quest, or else you'll have to start this stage again.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer is being stubborn, so you'll need to visit the Simpsons' home in Evergreen Terrace to investigate what he's planning. Once you're there, you'll need to inspect five remote controls, which are scattered around the house and marked with exclamation points.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">All that's left from here is talking. Return once again to Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and click through the quest dialogue to complete this stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</h3><p dir="ltr">Then, visit the NPC Hope at the donut shop in Donut District, and click through her quest dialogue to complete the first wave of story quests for Fortnite's Simpsons season.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996"></a><figcaption>Lost and Found quests come from these objects that sometimes pop out of chests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You won't find these quests in your menu, because they drop from treasure chests and ammo boxes, and you can also pick one up from the NPCs who offer them, which are Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart. These repeatable quests award high-quality loot for each one that you complete, as well as 1k XP. Plus, there's the 30k XP you receive for every three found or story quests you do, until you've done 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">There are four types of these quests right now, one for each member of the Simpson clan.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Marge wants you to collect some items, either several of the same thing, or different items of a certain rarity--like three uncommon items, which are green rarity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer's quests involve driving a distance in a vehicle. Just find a car, and do some driving.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Lisa will task you with finding her lost textbooks, which are scattered around whichever named location is nearest. You'll need to look for exclamation points on your mini-map to see where the books are, since they spawn randomly around each location.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Bart's quests require you to be destructive, either by damaging enemies or breaking stuff.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994"></a><figcaption>The home of the Simpsons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</h2><p dir="ltr">Finally, we have the season-long Kickstart quests that exist to encourage you to get acquainted with the new mechanics in Fortnite's Simpsons season. These are fairly simple and uncomplicated, and we'll explain them all below. Each of these quests is worth 30k XP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</h3><p dir="ltr">In the center of Evergreen Terrace, on the east side of the central square, is the iconic Simpsons house, pictured above for reference. Entering it will complete this quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</h3><p dir="ltr">The three boss NPCs--Evil Homer, Witch Marge, and Krusty the Clown--spawn randomly in named locations each match, but you can also find Dober Man guards near the KBBL Radio Towers. You can also spawn Dober Man guards by pressing the big red button on the desk in Burns Manor. Defeat two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</h3><p dir="ltr">There's a control point at Kamp Krusty that's been graced with a Camp Bart flag. Capture it to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</h3><p dir="ltr">These radio towers are serving at the storm forecast towers this season. Defeat the Dober Man guards and deliver the keycard they dropped to the radio tower for a weather forecast. Do this twice to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">Mr. Blasty is a new revolver in the loot pool this season, which drops from all normal sources of loot. You just need to shoot your enemies with it--bosses and other NPC enemies count for this.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">The Dober Man guards can be found at KBBL Radio Towers, and in Burns Manor if you press the red button on the desk in Burns' office.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</h3><p dir="ltr">Instead of normal blue chests, Simpsons season has added these question mark-covered boxes with enhanced loot. Search two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Drinking a Super Squishee drink, which can be purchased from any Qwik-E-Mart, gives you unlimited sprint, low gravity, and fast sprint for a limited time. Sprint for 250 meters while under that effect to complete the quest. You'll need to stay on the ground for this one, though, as distance traveled in the air doesn't count.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</h3><p dir="ltr">Eating a Blinky fish will give you a dash ability for a short time. Just hit the jump button while you're in the air to dash in any direction--the quest will complete after you've dashed four times.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</h3><p dir="ltr">Complete any of the quests in the Lost and Found section above for this one.</p>
