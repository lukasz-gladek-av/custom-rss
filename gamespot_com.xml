Having successfully completed a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene/ludocene-game-discovery-from-people-you-trust" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter</a> earlier this year, Ludoscene is a dating-app-inspired tool that helps you find new games based on what you already like. If a game comes up and you don't like it, swipe it away. If you love it, swipe it towards you, and the app will start to recommend games based on that choice, removing and adding more suggestions as you refine what you do and don't like.</p><p>The unique thing about it is that, according to its Kickstarter page, it uses "rich human-researched data to build your catalogue of games." Curation is the key thing here as opposed to something like Steam, which sometimes seems like it's just taking a guess at what you actually like.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:khblc2ysu56v5av7fpxfcob4/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvpsukmuvk2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidijaridfotgfdwxsfabugyocw3756qfvsk2wvnuryv7zlkgn52e4" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>🎉LUDOCENE LAUNCHED 🎉 So excited (and nervous) to send our game-finder into the world.

  </div><p>While it's a bit awkward to use with a mouse--the Tinder-like quality makes it more suited to smartphones or tablets--there are a huge range of games it can suggest. You can start "runs" in a few different ways, like starter packs based on the staff's personal picks, new and upcoming games, and recent discoveries. You can also start from specific games you like, or even based on the tastes of "experts." These include developers, journalists, streamers, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While on runs, you can view trailers for each of the games to see if they take your fancy, and if they do, you can pin them to remind yourself to play them later. Don't worry about skipping past games either, as there's an undo button, and the whole thing is free too. Perhaps this will be a good way to cut down your Steam wishlist full of games you swear you'll buy eventually.</p>

<section><p>Constantly shifting motivations and tumultuous overhauls have poisoned the well of Xbox's ecosystem.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Xbox is going through an identity crisis. The most recent wave of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#8">layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which cut about 9,000 jobs including numerous positions at studios under the Xbox banner, suggests as much. These cost-cutting measures are said to be in the service of some realignment or reorganization that's always purported to set up these companies for greater success. And yet they keep happening, further eroding any trust and goodwill the brand may have built up from previous successes. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/">several waves of job cuts</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/">restructurings</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/">pivots in strategy</a>, and any other corporate jargon I've neglected to mention, I'm beginning to suspect that Xbox's growing instability deserves more scrutiny and concern from its developers and consumers alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's be direct: The journey that Xbox has been on over the last decade appears to be a failure. Its famous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-criticism-of-lack-of-xbox-one-games-microsof/1100-6459602/">spree of purchases</a> and the subsequent management of its studios has churned out about as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/">blemished games</a> as it has delays, cancellations, and studio closures. That isn't to say Xbox hasn't produced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-series-x-games/2900-3818/">hits and gems</a>, but along the way there, Xbox has also built up quite the track record of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xboxs-recent-history-of-missing-and-or-canceled-games/2900-6775/">critically panned games, cancelled projects, and defunct teams</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Xbox Studio Closures Are Confusing | Spot On</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">No matter the aspect that you place under the microscope, Xbox is clearly bleeding through the bandages it keeps applying. Take a glimpse at the stable of teams at Xbox Game Studios, Microsoft's internal publishing division. Its most recent layoff resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/">closure of at least one team</a> under the banner, The Initiative, and the cancellation of its game Perfect Dark. Turn 10, one of its stalwart developers on the Forza franchise, has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">reportedly cut</a> to the bone. Rare, which was working on Everwild while maintaining the live-service title Sea of Thieves, is invariably in a worse position on the other side of the layoffs than it was before.</p><p dir="ltr">The brunt of the damage from moves like these falls on the affected teams and their workers, and it's a disappointingly common move for Xbox, which has done this at least once before when a similar reorganizing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/">shuttered four teams</a> in May 2024, including Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks. These closures came within a few short years of Microsoft's acquisition of Bethesda.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/">Another layoff</a> followed shortly after the completed purchase of Activision Blizzard, cutting several jobs across its teams and leading to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-untitled-survival-game-has-been-canceled-after-president-leaves-report/1100-6520603/">cancellation of a survival game at Blizzard</a>. The fact remains that bringing Bethesda's tremendous portfolio of megaton hits like Fallout and The Elder Scrolls in-house, as well as Activision Blizzard (and mobile developer King), should've stemmed the bloodloss, but Xbox's hemorrhaging and proclivity for retail therapy only seemed to worsen with each purchase. Anything else suggests the reckless endangerment of an entire industry.</p><p dir="ltr">These moves should've uniformly led to greater stability for developers under the Xbox banner and a greater deal of games on the platforms. They didn't. Some studios, like Obsidian, have miraculously flourished under these conditions, producing new franchises and hits in existing ones, solidifying its place in Xbox's crumbling hierarchy of studios. Others, like Arkane Austin, haven't been as lucky. And gamers and developers alike suffer when that's the case. If everyone's going through it, who exactly is benefitting from Xbox's continued vision--or lack thereof?</p><p dir="ltr">The motivation behind many of these purchases is an obvious one: Game Pass. Since its launch in 2017, the subscription service has been Xbox's biggest talking point, and as the years have passed, it has grown into the single biggest driver for engagement with the gaming division. Following the Xbox One's opening fumbles and hurdles, Microsoft devised a silver bullet that could rebuild its ecosystem and assure its biggest and smallest games had an audience. The service has even paid for the development of independent and third-party titles, making it a lifeline to some.</p><p dir="ltr">But Game Pass has been a pain to grow despite its occasional surges, and its continued upkeep remains costly despite <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1942469649423052857" rel="nofollow ">Xbox's claims that the service is profitable</a>, with some major caveats. As a result, Xbox has even transformed Game Pass for the worse, introducing tiers that sell greater benefits for high-paying subscribers, all the while stripping access to portions of the expansive game library from members at the lowest levels. This move is a sharp reversal of Game Pass' earliest promises to connect gamers to the breadth of the console's titles. What once was often touted as the best deal in gaming has now become so diluted that it is now more anti-consumer than its original incarnation. Another line crossed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544850" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4544850"></a><figcaption>An image from the recently cancelled Perfect Dark reboot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4544850-4525152-perfectdarkcanceled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And though Game Pass <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-paid-hundreds-of-millions-to-devs/1100-6501901/">funds the development</a> of a number of projects, and still does, many developers have spoken up about how Game Pass has actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-hurts-sales-says-dev-behind-xbox-game-pass-title/1100-6514084/">hurt their teams and titles</a>. Mike Rose of the indie publisher No More Robots has been pretty open in the past about how Game Pass can assure a huge launch audience, which is great for teams struggling to find players, but also noted how the team's games would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-xbox-game-pass-is-so-attractive-for-devs-whether-it-cannibalizes-sales-or-not/1100-6512698/">see little change in sales after being on the service</a>. Instead, it typically got spikes just as it was entering the subscription service. Raphael Colantonio, founder of Arkane and later Wolfeye Studios, has become one of the service's biggest critics, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-unloads-on-game-pass-calls-it-unsustainable/1100-6532991/">recently opining</a> that it is an "unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade, subsidized by [Microsoft's] 'infinite money.'" An isolated incident would be one thing, but grievances like Colantonio's have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dev-who-launched-game-into-game-pass-warns-against-launching-games-into-game-pass/1100-6532306/">continually cropped up</a> over the years, even if there are other stories that cite Game Pass as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-release-atomfall-was-immediately-profitable-report/1100-6531671/">instrumental to a game's success</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The evidence points to a concerning trend in the Xbox camp that doesn't appear to be going anywhere, and the more it's left as-is, the more likely it seems that developers will have to make a tough decision about their futures in Microsoft's ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's hard to prove either side is wrong or right due to the fact that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/">obscures any numbers</a> that could illuminate or disprove these arguments--numbers that Bloomberg's Jason Schreier refers to as "<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ltheyncqbc2h" rel="nofollow ">squishy metrics</a>" subject to the whims of "dark accounting wizardry." This means that teams looking for a publishing deal with Xbox simply need to take the company at its word when evaluating whether Game Pass is the right move for their game and their business. But what good is that word with the uncertainty that has persistently hung over Xbox's motivations and decisions for much of the last decade? Is it worth it to take that opportunity and fund that game if the near-future of your team continues to hang in the balance? Doesn't Xbox owe its developers more than false promises of stability once they join the Game Pass service considering how impactfully it can hurt a team's bottom line? Doesn't it owe the same kind of dependability to its subscribers?</p><p dir="ltr">I feel that answering these questions requires more foresight than I've observed from the brand. After all, this is the gaming giant that settled on the multimedia-heavy approach to the Xbox One that crippled the console out of the gate, and then took away Xbox users' ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-no-longer-offers-movies-and-tv-shows-to-buy-or-rent-but-there-are-other-ways/1100-6533271/">purchase and own digital movies and TV shows</a> recently. It's also the company that settled on an "Everything is an Xbox" marketing campaign that deemphasized the system itself after giving up so much ground to its contemporaries. The campaign isn't an affront itself, but when paired with the worsening Game Pass service, which is how the company can afford to turn smart TVs, Amazon Fire Sticks, and even your PC into an Xbox, the rottenness of the tactic becomes more apparent. Xbox's direction seems to pivot with the wind, and it means that the consumers who buy into its products, as well as the engineers who make them, and the developers that then work to give them value, constantly feel like they're sold up the river for the next big thing that the company does.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't feel answers coming any time soon. If the latest layoffs are any indication, Xbox's path forward is set in stone, and whatever may come of it has already been deemed worthy of the sacrifice it took to to be realized. As Christopher Dring of The Game Business succinctly puts it, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-xbox-we-knew-is-dead" rel="nofollow ">the Xbox we knew is dead</a>. And with it is any semblance of faith this industry and culture can muster for it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Many have circled October 10 on their calendars as the day <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/">Battlefield 6</a> launches, marking a new era for EA's flagship military simulation franchise. However, it's not the only game set to release that day; a new contender has appeared on the horizon, riding like the wind to try to steal the throne. Today, Outright Games and Mattel have announced Barbie: Horse Trails, a new "open-world adventure" featuring the iconic character.</p><p dir="ltr">Barbie: Horse Trails will let players choose between two characters--Barbie "Brooklyn" Roberts and Barbie "Malibu" Roberts--as they ride through Canterbury Trails Park, a landscape made up of multiple open areas. Each area holds new mysteries to solve, items to collect, and quests to complete as the duo, along with park rangers, try to "refresh and beautify" the park.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCm0_iOihMg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dCm0_iOihMg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Along with the main quest, multiple side missions will feature characters from the Barbie universe, including Ken, Teresa, Nikki, and Daisy. Other activities included in this new game will include a photo mode that players can use to document clues while solving mysteries, horse-care mechanics that will allow them to build their relationship with their horse, as well as customizable outfits, riding gear, and accessories.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Battlefield 6 and now Barbie: Horse Trails, October is shaping up to be the busiest month of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6526471/">2025 schedule</a> for the video game industry, as multiple high-profile titles are scheduled to launch between October 1 and Halloween. Notable releases include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-preorder-collectors-edition-playstation-5-amazon-walmart-target/1100-6531054/">Ghost of Yotei </a>on October 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-gamestop-exclusive-collectors-edition-preorders-live-now/1100-6532454/">Borderlands 4</a> the very next day, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> on October 16, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> on October 21.</p><p dir="ltr">Barbie: Horse Trails launches October 10 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">There's no question that continuing the success of the PlayStation 5 is one of Sony's top priorities, especially given that its latest console is getting closer to five years old. The Japanese tech giant has yet to formally announce the PlayStation 6, but over the past few months there have been some developments that have allowed us some rare insight into what shape the eventual console might take.</p><p dir="ltr">In this post, we're rounding up everything we know about Sony's PlayStation 6, a potential new Sony handheld, and what the future of console gaming might look like. Keep checking back for more as we update this post as new information comes to light the closer we get to an eventual release date in the next few years.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Release_Date__Potential_Price">PS6 Release Date, Potential Price</h4><p dir="ltr">Since no formal announcement has been made for the PlayStation 6, there's no release window to speak of. Taking the company's previous console generation cadence into consideration, one could assume that a PS6 could release in 2027. That would be seven years after the PS5, which itself launched seven years after the PS3. But the gaming industry has changed dramatically since then, which is evident in how long support for the PS4 has stuck around this far into a new generation of hardware. Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida recently shared that "2028 feels right" when asked about the PS6, but notably hasn't been at Sony since the end of 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite this, Sony Interactive Entertainment‘s new president and CEO <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-6-sony-says-future-platforms-top-of-mind-exploring-new-and-enhanced-ways-to-play/" rel="nofollow ">Hideaki Nishino stated in a business segment meeting</a> in 2024 that "the future of the (PlayStation) platform is top of mind. We are committed to exploring a new and enhanced way for players to engage with our content and services.”</p><p dir="ltr">Pricing would be similarly difficult to estimate, especially without any indication of the hardware specification that Sony is targeting. Most recently, Sony released the PS5 Pro, which retailed for $700 and offers the most powerful console-gaming experience on the market. That was a $200 premium over the price of the PS5 at launch. Whether the PS6 matches the pricing of the best PS5 on the market or falls between the two has yet to be seen, and will likely be affected by the continuing trade war and inflation.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6_Potential_Specs">PS6 Potential Specs</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony has committed to hardware in the face of the growing popularity of cloud-based services, saying that the majority of players still want a console that plays games locally.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cloud gaming is increasingly providing an additional option for players to access content, but our belief is that the majority of players continue to want to play and experience gaming through local execution without dependency on network conditions," Nishino said. "PS5 and PS5 Pro have validated this thesis, I believe."</p><p dir="ltr">There are no current concrete specifications for the PS6, but we do at least know that AMD will be providing hardware for the next-generation console. This shouldn't be that surprising, given that AMD has powered both the PS4 and PS5, and could bode well for backwards compatibility.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="PS6__The_Role_of_AI">PS6: The Role of AI</h4><p dir="ltr">Sony's partnership with AMD extends beyond hardware alone. Sony announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/18/24324317/amd-playstation-ai-work-better-graphics-project-amethyst" rel="nofollow ">Project Amethyst</a> in partnership with AMD when lead architect Mark Cerny revealed the news during the PS5 Pro breakdown, suggesting that the two companies are planning to work closely together on the future of graphical enhancements and the hardware that empowers it.</p><p dir="ltr">This has already borne fruit, with Cerny saying that the latest version on the PS5 Pro-exclusive upscaler, PSSR, will be using AMD's recently released RDNA 4 suite of AI-powered upscaling options, which debuted with the RX 9070 series of graphics cards. Cerny says that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pros-pssr-will-get-an-upgrade-in-2026/1100-6530019/">latest version of PSSR </a>will be a drop-in replacement for the current implementation in 2026 and, more importantly, it will help inform the future of this technology for newer hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">While AMD is expected to release new graphics cards in 2026 that support a newer version of RDNA, Cerny cautioned that Sony isn't exactly beholden to the same timelines. "AMD is moving extremely quickly," <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/playstation/sonys-mark-cerny-explains-why-your-ps5-pro-is-getting-an-upgrade-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">Cerny said</a>. "What I'm trying to do is prepare for the next generation of consoles, so my timeframe is multi-year here."</p><p dir="ltr">What this all means is that hardware is no longer the only determining factor in the power of a future console. PSSR is only supported on the PS5 Pro currently, given its requirement for hardware to drive its AI-powered upscaling, and suggests the same will be true for the PS6. AMD is expected to power the next Xbox too, and the ways in which both Microsoft and Sony work with AMD might determine how well any platform-specific branches of these upscaling features work. Those alone could be big differentiators during the next console generation.</p><p dir="ltr">With that said, AMD Computing &amp; Graphics SVP and GM Jack Huynh did state in a <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1940049247920943136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940049247920943136%7Ctwgr%5Ef7c487b8895af695c0410a305a57a77e4f7492d6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playstationlifestyle.net%2F2025%2F07%2F01%2Fps6-push-boundaries-graphically-amd-playstation%2F" rel="nofollow ">tweet</a> about Project Amethyst that AMD and Sony are "developing high-quality neural networks that push the boundaries of real-time game graphics," suggesting that the PS6 will hopefully be a meaningful leap forward in terms of visual rendering that some have suggested was lacking with the PS5.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="A_PlayStation_Handheld_With_The_PS6_">A PlayStation Handheld With The PS6?</h4><p dir="ltr">According to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-reportedly-developing-a-ps5-portable-system/1100-6528023/">Bloomberg report in 2024</a>, Sony is potentially in the planning phases of a new gaming handheld--the company's first since the PS Vita. The handheld is reportedly being designed to play PS5 games natively, but might still be years away from announcement if Sony decides to pursue its development.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony did launch the PS Portal in 2023, which initially acted solely as a means to play your PS5 games remotely over a local network. It has since received an update to add the ability to stream games from the cloud to expand its capabilities away from your console.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS Portal was reportedly initially conceived as a new handheld platform entirely before plans changed closer to its release. Given its popularity, and that of other handheld consoles such as the Nintendo Switch 2, Steam Deck, and Asus ROG Ally, Sony might be thinking the time is right for another attempt at the handheld market. Microsoft is planning the same too, albeit with a partnership with Asus for the time being.</p>
