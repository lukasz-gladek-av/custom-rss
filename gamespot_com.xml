                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> received a brand-new update yesterday, mostly focusing on quality-of-life improvements, but it also introduces a big performance and visuals feature. With this <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/patch-1-4-0-is-now-live" rel="nofollow ">update</a>, frame generation and low-latency mode support for DLSS and XeSS has been added in for compatible GPUs on PC. Developer Sandfall also noted that it's "still exploring support for FSR, but we need more time to work on it. Stay tuned for more updates on that in a future patch!"</p><p dir="ltr">On to the quality-of-life improvements! The completionists amongst you that hate getting booted out to the overworld again after failing a boss fight will be very happy to hear that a "Battle Retry Prompt" has been added in as of this update, simply "giving you the option to quickly retry the battle."</p>

                <p>Valve co-founder Gabe Newell has revealed he originally thought he might become a doctor before he had a fateful chance meeting at Microsoft where future CEO Steve Ballmer gave him some pointed advice.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="http://youtube.com/@zalkar.saliev">YouTuber Zalkar Saliev</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-young-gabe-newell-thought-i-was-going-to-be-a-doctor-until-he-ended-up-visiting-his-brother-at-microsoft-where-steve-ballmer-got-mad-and-said-if-youre-going-to-be-hanging-out-here-why-dont-you-do-something-useful/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Newell said when he started programming in high school, it wasn't necessarily thought to be a real career path. Video games didn't exist at that time, either, he said. "So when I was a kid I thought I was going to be a doctor, and programming was what I did when I should have been doing something else," he said. "It wasn't a career path, you know, there were no classes in it, and my first programmable device was a calculator, a [Texas Instruments] calculator."</p><p>Newell's brother Dan worked at Microsoft and was an early hire for the company, which was founded in 1975. At the time, Microsoft wasn't a big player in software development, with Newell saying it was only the third-largest software developer in Washington state. "So there was no notion of having any of the reputation that it would have, say, 10 years later," he said.</p><p>Newell visited his brother at work one day with the expectation that the two of them would just hang out. Newell said Ballmer got upset with him because he was distracting Dan. Newell said Ballmer told him, "'If you're going to be hanging out here, you know, why don't you do something useful?'"</p><p>So that's what Newell did--he took time off at Harvard to "just work at Microsoft."</p><p>Newell never returned to Harvard and instead built a career at Microsoft where he helped build the first versions of Microsoft Windows. He worked at Microsoft for 13 years before leaving in 1996 to start Valve with another Microsoft employee, Mike Harrington. Newell enjoyed tremendous success at Valve, helping steer the company through various game-development projects and the creation of Steam.</p><p>Newell is now a billionaire who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newells-daily-routine-sounds-very-legit/1100-6533251/" data-ref-id="1100-6533251">works from his yacht and goes scuba diving on breaks.</a> Newell also recently revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gabe-newell-explains-the-secret-to-his-success/1100-6533485/" data-ref-id="1100-6533485">secret to his success.</a></p>

                <p>Last week, the typically indie digital-games storefront Itch.io deindexed a majority of not safe for work (NSFW) or adult content. Deindexing doesn't mean that the games are all no longer available, but it does mean you can no longer find them through searching on the site. This came after the organisation <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">Collective Shout</a> launched a campaign against both Itch.io and Steam demanding that payment processors prevent the sale of particular forms of content. Now, in an <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq" rel="nofollow ">updated FAQ from Itch.io</a>, the storefront has shared that it's looking to work with other payment processors that do allow NSFW and adult content.</p><p dir="ltr">Explaining the timeline for these changes, Itch.io wrote, "The situation is evolving as we await final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal. There are still unknowns that prevent us from providing a fixed timeline.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the meantime, we are actively reaching out to other payment processors that are more willing to work with this kind of content. We have suspended the ability to pay with Stripe for 18+ content for the foreseeable future. Our immediate focus has been on content classification reviews and implementing stricter age-gating on the site."</p><p dir="ltr">The expanded FAQ also explained why so many more games have been removed from Itch.io as opposed to Steam: "The difference in our responses stems from the difference in our platforms. Steam is a “closed” platform where every product page is approved before it appears on the store. Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages.</p><p dir="ltr">"Itch.io is an open, “UGC” (User-Generated Content) platform. With over 2 million product pages, anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers. We could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."</p><p dir="ltr">Since the changes took place, payment processors like Visa and Mastercard have also been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games" rel="nofollow ">inundated with emails and phone calls</a> in an effort to push back against the banning of adult content. The International Game Developers Association has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">released a statement condemning the move</a>.</p>

                <p>The next Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drag-x-drive/" data-ref-id="5000-671279">Drag x Drive</a>, arrives soon on August 14. Ahead of its release, Nintendo has uploaded a new gameplay trailer revealing more details and reminding players of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-try-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-drag-x-drive-next-month-but-theres-a-catch/1100-6533193/" data-ref-id="1100-6533193">upcoming Global Jam demo</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ls_NtQ0s8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-Ls_NtQ0s8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This will kick off on August 9 and runs through August 10, but the catch here is that you'll need an active Switch Online membership to access it. If you're interested, the demo will be available to download later today and the sessions will take place at the following times:</p><h2>Drag x Drive Global Jam playtest times</h2><h3>August 9</h3><ul><li>3 AM - 7 AM PT / 6 AM ET - 10 AM ET</li><li>5 PM - 9 PM PT / 8 PM ET - 12 AM ET</li></ul><h3>August 10</h3><ul><li>9 AM - 1 PM PT / 12 PM ET - 4 PM ET</li></ul><p>As mentioned above, the new overview trailer also provided plenty of details on how to play Drag x Drive. The Joy-Con 2 controllers are used to control each wheel on the wheelchair via mouse controls, and you can swipe forward or backward to control your momentum and direction. While a table is probably best for using these controls, Nintendo added that "most" flat surfaces--like your legs--will do just fine in a pinch. I've also tried the mouse controls on my oblivious cat as he naps on my bed next to me, and his squishy body worked surprisingly well as an impromptu mousepad while creating art in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Drag x Drive is one of two big releases for the Switch 2 in August. An upgraded version of Kirby and the Forgotten Land launches on August 28, and it'll include a brand-new expansion alongside updated graphics.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> is also out in October, and Nintendo announced a new Direct livestream for July 31. The company says there'll be "roughly 25 minutes of information" on upcoming games to expect here, so it'll be interesting to see if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> gets a proper release-date confirmation.</p>
