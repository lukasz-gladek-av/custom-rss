                <p>It's been 12 years since Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show, but the musician has found a new big venue where he can sing without even leaving his home. This weekend, the hit Roblox game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/steal-a-brainrot/" data-ref-id="5000-682152">Steal a Brainrot</a> is going to host a pop up performance by Bruno Mars that's a one-time only appearance.</p><p>The official announcement went out on Roblox's social media channels. Mars' performance will be held on Saturday, January 17 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p><p>Although musical acts like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-stray-kids-are-coming-to-roblox/1100-6537123/" data-ref-id="1100-6537123">Stray Kids</a> have performed in Roblox before, Mars will be the first to do so for Steal a Brainrot, which launched in May 2025. He's expected to sing his new single, I Just Might, as well as an older song, Locked Out of Heaven.</p><p>To mark the occasion, players will have the chance to get a Bruno Mars Brainrot, as well as other related in-game items and traits.</p><p>Steal a Brainrot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/" data-ref-id="5000-681260">Grow a Garden</a>, and the larger Roblox sandbox were among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-switch-2-and-brainrot-dominated-the-youtube-trends-of-2025/1100-6536632/" data-ref-id="1100-6536632">the top-trending topics on YouTube in 2025</a>.

According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a>, the platform has had major issues with child predators. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> even sued Roblox over that issue.</p><p>Roblox has since introduced initiatives to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">keep children from talking to strangers</a>, and to limit their interactions to kids roughly their own age. Earlier this month, Roblox continued its global rollout of a facial age-check system, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-has-added-facial-age-verification-with-very-mixed-results/1100-6537378/" data-ref-id="1100-6537378">the results have been mixed at best</a>.</p>
