                <p>If weapons are the stars of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503">Terraria</a>, accessories are the quiet directors backstage. A single slot might not seem like much on its own, but with up to seven of the right trinkets equipped, your humble pixelated self transforms from target practice to terror incarnate.</p><p dir="ltr">There’s no shortage of options, especially once you start combining effects or tinkering with modifiers. So, rather than flood you with 37 “great picks” and a dozen situational caveats, we’re cutting through the fat and crowning the best-in-class endgame accessories for each of Terraria’s four core playstyles: Melee, Ranged, Magic, and Summoner. Simple as that.</p><p dir="ltr">And yes, you should absolutely still stack damage, crit, and movement speed modifiers like your life depends on it, because it does.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529528"></a><figcaption>Melee accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529528-melee-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for melee</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Fire Gauntlet</strong>: +100% knockback, up to +12% damage, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing, inflicts fire damage over time</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mechanical glove</strong>: +12% melee damage and speed, +10% melee weapon size, enables autoswing</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Warrior Emblem</strong>: +15% melee damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Frozen Shield</strong>: Immune to knockback, reduces damage by 25% (when below 50% health), absorbs 25% of teammate damage (when above 25% health)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Yoyo Bag</strong>: Increased yoyo range, can wield two yoyos</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It all starts with a modest little pair of claws. Then you fuse it with a Titan Glove. Then you wrap it in lava. Welcome to the Fire Gauntlet, the undisputed king of melee accessories.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal is straightforward. More damage, faster swings, increased knockback, and automatic autoswing on everything from katanas to solar eruption whips. This thing turns your character into a buzzsaw. Whether you’re carving through Plantera’s vines or trying not to get deleted by a Moon Lord phase change, the Fire Gauntlet keeps your offence brutal and relentless.</p><p>It also applies a permanent Hellfire or On Fire! debuff on hit depending on your platform, which stacks with other damage-over-time effects to shred enemies faster than they can blink. If you’re running a melee build, you want this. And ideally with a Warding modifier, unless you’ve got a death wish and a nurse on speed dial.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529529"></a><figcaption>Ranged accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529529-ranged-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for ranged</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Molton Quiver</strong>: +10% damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and turns Wooden Arrows into Flaming Arrows</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Stalker’s Quiver</strong>: +10% arrow damage, increased arrow speed, 20% chance not to consume arrows, and enemies are less likely to target you</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ranger Emblem</strong>: +15% ranged damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Recon Scope</strong>: + 10% ranged damage, +10% critical strike chance, enemies are less likely to target you, and increases view range for guns</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Let’s not beat around the bush. Guns and bows don’t hit their stride until you start buffing the hell out of their crit rate and projectile behaviour. That’s where the Recon Scope steps in.</p><p dir="ltr">Born from the union of Putrid Scent and a Sniper Scope, the Recon Scope does two things exceptionally well. It increases ranged damage and boosts critical strike chance. Combine that with its long-range targeting assist and it turns you into Terraria’s deadliest cameraman, blowing heads off from a safe distance.</p><p dir="ltr">The real magic, though, lies in how it works with multi-projectile weapons. Fire a Tsunami or Daedalus Stormbow and you’re suddenly raining death with terrifying precision. It’s especially lethal in multiplayer, where you can comfortably sit behind your meat shield friends and delete bosses before they even notice you.</p><p dir="ltr">Bonus points: Stack it with a Molten Quiver or Stalker’s Quiver for synergy with bows. Yes, they stack. Yes, it’s busted. No, we’re not complaining.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529531"></a><figcaption>Magic accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529531-magic-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Best accessories for magic</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Celestial Cuffs</strong>: Restores mana when damaged, +20 increased maximum mana, increased Mana Star pickup range</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Sorcerer Emblem</strong>: +15% magic damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Regeneration Band</strong>: +20 increased maximum mana, increases mana regeneration rate</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Mana Cloak</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, causes stars to fall upon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Arcane Flower</strong>: -8% mana cost, uses mana potions automatically, and enemies are less likely to target you</li></ul><p dir="ltr">You don’t need to be a wizard to know that mana is a problem in early Hardmode. That’s why many players rush the Celestial Cuffs, a surprisingly stacked accessory that restores mana when you take damage and sucks in mana stars from across the screen like a magical Dyson. Pair that with a Mana Cloak, and you’ll generate the very stars you need to keep afloat.</p><p dir="ltr">But if we’re choosing the top-tier pick for endgame spell-slinging, there’s only one champion. The Celestial Emblem.</p><p dir="ltr">This bad boy grants a flat 15% boost to all magic damage, and if you’ve ever nuked a boss with Nebula Blaze or decimated crowds with Last Prism, you know how much that multiplier matters. The emblem synergises perfectly with high-DPS magic builds, making it the clear favourite for mages who want to kill first and mana-manage later.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529533"></a><figcaption>Summoner accessories</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529533-summoner-terraria-accessories.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Best accessories for Summoner</span></h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Papyrus Scarab</strong>: +1 max minion count, +15% summon weapon damage, and +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Hercules Beetle</strong>: +15% summon damage, +2 minion knockback</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Summoner Emblem</strong>: +15% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Necromatic Scroll</strong>: +1 max minion count, +10% summon damage</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pygmy Necklace</strong>: +1 max minion count</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Summoners have always had it rough in Terraria. For the longest time, you had to choose between looking cool and actually doing damage. But once the Papyrus Scarab enters your inventory, the suffering ends.</p><p dir="ltr">This elegant little bug boosts minion damage by 15%, increases knockback, and lets you summon one extra minion. That might not sound revolutionary, but when your build revolves around overwhelming the screen with spiderlings, Stardust Dragons, or Terraprisma clones, more is always better.</p><p dir="ltr">Papyrus Scarab is a fusion of the Necromantic Scroll and Hercules Beetle, both found post-Plantera, so it’s a late-game investment. But summoners are used to that. The payoff? You become a walking army, effortlessly chewing through invasions and bosses while you stand back and admire your minions like the world’s most bloodthirsty talent scout.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The bottom line</h2><p dir="ltr">Accessories in Terraria aren’t just side perks. They’re the spine of every build. Whether you’re swinging swords, firing arrows, hurling magic, or sending your minions to do the dirty work, the right pick for your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/" data-ref-id="1100-6533073">Terraria weapons</a> amplifies your power, shores up your weaknesses, and gives you the edge you need when the screen starts flashing red.</p><p dir="ltr">Want to go even further? You can. With accessory slots expanding thanks to items like the Demon Heart and the Void Bag letting you swap builds on the fly, there’s plenty of room for experimentation. But if you’re looking for a definitive loadout anchor per class, this is it.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>There's nothing worse in The Sims 4 than encountering bugs in gameplay, especially when you've run into something unusual that's difficult to do a Google search about. It's an inevitable thing, though. The Sims 4 is more than a decade old--it's an early PlayStation 4 game, after all--and so some serious creakiness is to be expected. Things just break down and get messy from time to time.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, The Sims 4 has been so popular that it'd be tough to encounter a bug that's completely unique to you. At this point, we've got a fairly clear set of steps you can take to figure out what's wrong when your game is just kinda freaking out on you. Scroll on for your best options.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Reset your Sim(s)</h2><p dir="ltr">Sometimes your Sims will be going about their business when they just stop responding to orders and seemingly freeze up. It's the most common issue in The Sims 4, and the first thing to try in those situations is to reset the bugged-out Sim in question. To do this, open the cheat console by pressing ctrl+shft+C on PC, or by holding down all four shoulder buttons on Xbox or Playstation. Next, type ResetSim and then the name of the Sim in question--like "ResetSim Dina Caliente." If you've activated cheats (console command "testingcheats true"), PC and Mac users will also have the quicker option of pressing shift while clicking on the Sim, and then choosing the option "Reset Sim (Debug)."</p><p dir="ltr">Resetting a Sim clears out all their random impulses from their action queue. Sometimes, Sims just get too many things going at the same time, like a bunch of other Sims trying to get their attention all at once, and it overloads their li'l computer brains and locks them up while they try to figure out what has the highest priority. Resetting will free their mind, so to speak.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Clear the cache</h2><p dir="ltr">Likewise, the cache for The Sims 4 as a whole can become overloaded in the same way that a Sim itself can be, but we can solve that one by clearing the game cache. Clearing the cache on PC or Mac is simple, as it merely involves deleting two files. First, navigate to Documents &gt; Electronic Arts &gt; The Sims 4. Once you're there, you'll delete two files: localthumbcache.package and avatarcache.package.</p><p dir="ltr">If you play The Sims 4 on Xbox or PlayStation, clearing the cache is even easier than it is on PC. Just turn your system all the way off--not rest mode--and then unplug it for 60 seconds. This clears the cache for the entire system.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Check your mods</h2><p dir="ltr">For a lot of Sims PC players, it's tough to imagine playing without mods. But it's those same mods that often get us into trouble, usually when they haven't been kept up to date. And after 11 years, there are<em> a lot</em> of old, abandoned mods out there. Unfortunately, it's not always easy to tell which mod is causing you problems, or whether it really is a mod that's responsible for your problems at all. So we've got a couple steps you can take to pinpoint whether a mod is the issue, and narrow down which mod it might be.</p><p dir="ltr">First, you'll want to test if a mod is the culprit at all by disabling them completely. You can do this by going to the Other section of the game settings, and unchecking this check box:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568" data-ratio="0.65407407407407" data-width="1350" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529568"></a><figcaption>This is where you can disable all your mods at once.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529568-sims4screenshot2025.07.03-00.45.29.63%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Save your settings, restart the game, and see how it works. If your bug isn't presenting itself anymore, then it was probably a mod that caused it. Now you'll need to narrow down which mod is the issue. One relatively easy test you can try is to pull half of your mods from the mods folder in your Documents folder, clear the cache, then load your game again. If you still have the bug, then one of your active mods is the problem--and if you don't, then it means one of the inactive ones is causing the trouble. You can continue narrowing it down from there by doing the same thing with the half that seems to have the problem mod, or if you've narrowed it down to your satisfaction, you may want to start removing specific mods you think might be the culprit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570" data-ratio="0.56289129197496" data-width="1757" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529570"></a><figcaption>Here is where you can repair your Sims 4 installation in the EA app.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4529570-screenshot%28152%29.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Repair installation</h2><p dir="ltr">You may have key game files that are missing or corrupted--another occasional side effect of using out-of-date mods. In these situations, you can use the EA app to check your installation directory and replace any crucial files that have gone missing or been corrupted. Just navigate to the main Sims 4 page in the app, and click on the Manage button to the left of Play. Select Repair from the dropdown menu. The EA app will then scan all your base game and DLC files for anything anomalous. This process <em><strong>does not</strong></em> check your mods, only the game files themselves.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consider culling Sims</h2><p dir="ltr">There is a limit to how many Sims that The Sims 4 can support at once. By default, the game caps the total population at 200, but you can remove that cap in the settings if you want. But no matter how good your computer may be, The Sims 4 will eventually slow down significantly if you add too many Sims. Even playing on a modern gaming rig with an RTX 4080 and an i9 CPU like I do, The Sims 4 tends to get real creaky when my world's population gets past 750 or so.</p><p dir="ltr">The Sims 4 is built to prevent that creakiness from happening by culling unplayed Sim families from the game periodically, but you can also protect a household from being culled by adding them to your list of played households. If your game has way too many Sims, the population could be the source of your problems. Moving inessential households over to the unplayed bucket will allow the game to remove them when or if it needs to. This is only a concern for players who have more than a couple hundred Sims in their game, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Consult the community</h2><p>Lastly, there are two immense community resources you can take advantage of if the above checklist doesn't handle your issues: the <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/the-sims-4-bug-reports-archive-en/re-read-first-compiled-list-of-reported-issues/11182959" rel="nofollow ">EA forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lp8wwd/troubleshooting_thread_bugs_errors_mod_issues_ea/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>. Those have been the two most central discussion hubs for The Sims 4 since it launched--presuming your problem isn't unique to your setup, there's a very good chance you'll be able to find somebody else who's had the same issue in the past.</p>

It's available in two colors, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7Q3VG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a>. Both models have black sticks, face buttons with the standard Xbox color scheme, and the retro-style D-pad found on most 8BitDo controller. It has tactile handles that are contoured to look and feel quite similar to a console/PC controller.</p><p>The Ultimate's numerous premium components and features make it a serious competitor to mobile controllers that retail for double the price (or more). It has two remappable back buttons that will feel familiar to those who have used one of 8BitDo's Ultimate Controllers for PC or Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The full-sized thumbsticks utilize Hall Effect sensors, which offer a smoother feel and are generally more durable than conventional analog sticks because you don't have to worry about stick drift. The right and left triggers are activated via Hall Effect sensors as well. With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2, you can remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and create up to three custom profiles.</p><p>The stretchable bridge is large enough to fit all iPhone models and most Android phones. As long as your device is within the range of 100-170mm (3.93-6.69in) in length, you're good to go. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest edition so far, is 6.42 inches.</p><p>The phone cradle offers a secure fit thanks to a few design features. It has a rubberized back and tabs on each side to grip your phone while also preventing scratches. The back sheet of rubber is dotted with a series of button symbols that create a textured feel. Additionally, the bottom corners jut out slightly from the handles for extra support.</p><p>Since it connects wirelessly to your device via Bluetooth, you can also use it with Android tablets, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even the Apple Vision Pro. 8BitDo says the 300mAh battery offers up to 13 hours on a full charge (1.5 hours to recharge).</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller for iOS &amp; Android (White)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F9L7L7CJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 | Officially licensed by Xbox</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Here's a quick rundown of the specs, which are virtually identical to its predecessor.

Made in collaboration with XR glasses manufacturer Viture, the translucent black <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F5WRZ3LJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Controller with USB-C</a> is only compatible with Android and costs $79. An iPhone version of the Viture x 8BitDo Ultimate is in the works and is expected to release this year. You don't need <a href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Pro-XR-Glasses-Electrochromic/dp/B0D3LRH8G4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Viture XR Glasses</a> to use the USB-C version, but we'd recommend checking out the XR glasses regardless because the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/viture-pro-xr-glasses-prime-day-deal-save-big-on-wearable-135-inch-display/1100-6529930/" data-ref-id="1100-6529930">wearable display tech</a> is immensely impressive.</p><h2>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller vs. the competition for iPhone</h2><p>The Ultimate Mobile Bluetooth Controller is half the <i>regular </i>price of the popular Backbone One. Regular is in italics because <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0CCT2TJW4,B0CCT2LWT8,B0CT17GPNT,B0CT1BRLZ9,B0DQM23MLZ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has the Backbone One 2nd Gen for $70 (was $100)</a></strong> and the 1st Gen models for $60 right now. From a build perspective, I preferred the original 8BitDo Mobile Controller for Android over the Backbone One. That said, Backbone's app is also a pretty awesome console-like launcher, whereas 8BitDo's Ultimate Software is just for control configuration. The Backbone connects to your phone's USB-C or Lightning port, which is typically better than Bluetooth in terms of input response times--though many people won't notice the difference. The Backbone One doesn't have back buttons or full-sized sticks; for those features, you have to make the jump to the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>.

Only the $100 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F233Y5YL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 base model</a> is comparable to the 8BitDo Ultimate or Backbone, but it's a rather impressive option thanks to TMR electromagnetic sticks, remappable back buttons, and a premium build. The $150 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro</a> also works on iPhone and Android phones as well as 8-inch tablets. It has extra features such as remappable claw bumpers and Razer's mecha-tactile, mouse-like button.

It connects to iPhone 15/16 and small tablets like the iPad Mini via USB-C. This model doesn't have back buttons, but it does have Hall Effect sticks.
