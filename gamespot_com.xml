                <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s Season 2 launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-update-delayed-to-help-refine-the-content-after-fan-feedback/1100-6537352/" data-ref-id="1100-6537352">was pushed back to February 17</a> to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.</p><p>Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take "approximately 40% more hits" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.</p><p>Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve "responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer." The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.</p><p>Since Season 1 has been extended, Battlefield Studios is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-delay-adds-more-challenges-cosmetics-and-double-xp-to-season-1/1100-6537406/" data-ref-id="1100-6537406">adding new weekly challenges</a> and a Frostfire bonus path that includes a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items. Season pass owners will also be able to get a weapon package, an XP boost for your entire career, and more cosmetics.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 are below, and they will go live on January 20 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h3><ul><li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li><li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li><li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li></ul><h3>Changelog</h3><h3>Vehicles</h3><p>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</p><p>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><ul><li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li><li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li><li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li><li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li><li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li><li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li><li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks.

                <p>It’s a bad time to be in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossings-next-update-has-players-revisiting-long-deserted-islands/1100-6537314/" data-ref-id="1100-6537314">Animal Crossing</a> hotel business. New Horizons’ 3.0 update introduced a wave of new features, but one addition stands out above the rest: a fully fledged hotel that appears on the pier of every island. Overnight, that official beachfront resort has effectively put countless player-made hotels out of business.</p><p>That might matter more if anyone besides Tom Nook--and the long-suffering players paying off his loans--actually exchanged money in New Horizons. Still, the arrival of an island-sanctioned hotel has made the decision to tear down pre-update resorts an easy one for many players who suddenly found their handmade creations obsolete.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing New Horizon 3.0 Update - Everything You Need to do Day One</p>
      </div>
<p>"The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier," wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdah21/the_new_pier_hotel_spells_doom_for_my_islands/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>. "These are truly troubling times for the residents of my island!"</p><p>Hotels have long been a popular attraction for Animal Crossing players, even though the game has never provided the infrastructure to build a functional one. Instead, players relied on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/20-years-ago-animal-crossing-finally-showed-what-it-could-be/1100-6536728/" data-ref-id="1100-6536728">creativity</a> and illusion. Some terraformed multi-room interiors and used partitions to simulate hallways and suites, while others leaned into visual trickery, creating hotel facades meant to be admired from a specific angle.</p><p>One such example can be seen in a Reddit post documenting the final day of an island’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdmq9a/the_last_day_of_my_islands_hotel_dodo_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dodo Hotel</a>, a lovingly crafted facade that existed purely for aesthetics. These facades have become works of art in their own right, allowing players to build convincing cityscapes that evoke sun-soaked Greek islands, dense urban skylines, or luxury five-star resorts looming in the distance.</p><p>The 3.0 update finally brings those hotel fantasies into the game in an official capacity, but it does so with a rigid, one-size-fits-all design. The new hotel is anchored to a specific pier at the front corner of each island, limiting where and how it can exist. Players were quick to discover, however, that while the structure itself is fixed, the surrounding area is not.</p><p>As expected, players immediately got to work customizing their piers to stand out from countless of other islands around the world. One Redditor, jorgom, used custom designs, fences, castle pillars, and themed furniture to transform their pier into a hotel inspired by the Sanrio character <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qeim2x/my_attempt_at_a_pompompurinthemed_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pompompurin</a>, turning a standardized feature into something personal.</p><p>In many ways, the new hotel represents Animal Crossing’s ongoing tension between player creativity and developer-imposed boundaries. Nintendo has given players more tools than ever, but those tools still arrive with clear limits. The community’s response-- decorating around, over, and in spite of those limits--remains as inventive as ever.</p><p>Player-made hotels may be disappearing, but the instinct behind them hasn’t gone anywhere. Even when the game builds something for players, they’ll still find ways to rebuild it in their own image, proving once again that New Horizons is less about what Nintendo adds and more about what players do with it.</p>

                <p>This Sunday's NFL playoffs divisional round matchup between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans will feature a World of Warcraft-themed attraction for tailgaters, and it's because Blizzard's data shows that its players love sports.</p><p>The World of Warcraft: Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern, as it's called, is a marketing activation that's meant to promote WoW's upcoming Midnight expansion. Inside the tavern, people can get a drink and watch World of Warcraft livestreams. They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.</p><p>The Midnight expansion adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-future-housing-plans-include-co-decorating-and-a-long-requested-feature/1100-6537427/" data-ref-id="1100-6537427">player housing</a>, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/sb-blogs/newsletter-gaming/2026/01/16/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Business Journal.</a></p><p>People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.</p><p>But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.</p><p>"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport," Austin said. "We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight launches on March 2</a>, and will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones</a> as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.</p>

                <p>As part of a joke that is perhaps going too far, the markedly terrible Cory in the House game is not only closely trailing Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 in user ratings, but sealed copies of it are priced for hundreds of dollars online.</p><p>There are numerous listings for the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=cory+in+the+house+ds&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_dmd=2&amp;rt=nc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo DS game on eBay</a>, with prices ranging from $50 to $1,420.69 (har, har). <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/287076001760?_skw=cory+in+the+house+ds&amp;itmmeta=01KF445W82KRV1TZH9JW1FAD2E&amp;hash=item42d71027e0:g:0tAAAeSw1fRpaHvp&amp;itmprp=enc%3AAQALAAAA8O7PUuNWmJ%2B%2BUShgI9tQz%2FoqlAj3ajzySrMlkRz%2BSjaQetANhD4HFuB2aX2U9vpRjiNxkBdIVvIuB2Ly9Zflru3bauLdGJ10R7lgg5Oz6jM%2BlGtx%2FDuGatcoyjqkBSau2W5b9lUJSTnbbCyWkm8%2BWSUBeLYqaLe1dQ2o83Jul58ZbVmkSLPJVcGrJOxY2XPO8XopF29clwFAmxBRLjws8xn8AQ2KM1kNg%2FEezRjJjcRw1e8JmH95CHpcXEfVg1Lm%2FsyZas7lB%2BShMWBh3gngPuSAbO7JjAduluYdAtYdqO6ofwq0sEejxdgsI%2BB1fyZQJg%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR4TFl4T5Zg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One listing</a> even has 44 bids and currently prices the game at $1,025.00.</p><p>This bizarre event appears to stem from the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/all-time/userscore/?releaseYearMin=1958&amp;releaseYearMax=2026&amp;page=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Best Games by User Score</a> list of GameSpot sister site Metacritic, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">2025 Game of the Year winner</a> Clair Obscur sitting at the top with a 9.6 user score. But because the internet loves a good gag, Cory in the House has recently surfaced as the runner-up with a score of 9.3, tied with The Witcher 3, two versions of Metal Gear Solid 3, the original Silent Hill 2, and a couple of other classics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4636478-screenshot2026-01-16144517.png" data-ref-id="1300-4636478" data-ratio="0.7911227154047" data-width="1149" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4636478-screenshot2026-01-16144517.png" data-ref-id="1300-4636478"></a><figcaption>Listings on eBay have Cory in the House selling for hundreds of dollars.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4636478-screenshot2026-01-16144517.png"></figure><p>Released in 2008, a year that graced us with Grand Theft Auto 4, Fallout 3, and Dead Space, Cory in the House is based on the Disney Channel show of the same name.</p><p>Players fill the shoes of Cory Baxter from the classic kid-friendly sitcom That's So Raven, whose father works as the White House head chef. The handheld game's epic tale follows Cory as he fights an evil toymaker who threatens to hypnotize the people of Washington, D.C. with modified bobbleheads depicting the President of the United States.</p><p>As with most tie-in games of the day, the very few <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/disney-cory-in-the-house/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviews of the DS game were negative</a>. Somehow, the game got a resurgence of attention years after its release, with people <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-cory-in-the-house-ds-went-from-bad-forgotten-game-1842525482" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ironically praising as a masterpiece</a> deserving to be enshrined and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/881458-cory-in-the-house" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">jokingly categorizing the show as anime</a>. In other words, Cory in the House is the video game equivalent of the Morbius movie.</p><p>There's no telling if people will actually purchase copies of this notorious game at absurdly high prices, or if Metacritic will intervene and put an end to this Cory-mentum. For now, we can sit back and see how much higher the numbers can get.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself "checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.</p><p>Other players have already noticed this and released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a less DLC checks mod</a> that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.</p><p>Capcom had previously promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update released this winter</a> would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.</p>
