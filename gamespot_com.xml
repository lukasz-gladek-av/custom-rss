                <p>The hints about the impending return of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater after a five-year hiatus started appearing earlier this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-update-is-apparently-teasing-a-tony-hawks-pro-skater-reveal/1100-6529622/" data-ref-id="1100-6529622">the release of a new Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 map</a>. Shortly thereafter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-site-is-counting-down-to-an-announcement/1100-6529655/" data-ref-id="1100-6529655">the official site for THPS began counting down</a> to March 4. While Activision and Tony Hawk himself are likely waiting for that day--which conspicuously happens to be 3/4-- to make their announcement, a rating has been issued for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, a remastered edition of two earlier games in the franchise.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-rated-in-singapore-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, the Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore <a href="https://imdaonline.imda.gov.sg/Classification/Search/VideoGames/SearchDetail.aspx?sTitle=IDX/2502/000036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has approved a rating</a> for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5. A launch date wasn't disclosed, but the game is listed as a 2025 release.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was originally released in 2001, and it was followed by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 in 2002. This double remaster follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which was released in 2020. There haven't been any new console games in the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015. The official X account for the franchise has dropped a new teaser message that reads, "Loading... new parks 3/4/25."</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. That game changed his life, and Hawk hasn't made any secret about his desire to continue the franchise that made him a video game legend. The 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was in September 2024, and Hawk revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he had been in contact with Activision</a> about the occasion. Although no announcement was made at the time, Hawk assured THPS fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the franchise was far from over</a>.</p><p>An earlier report suggested that the next Tony Hawk game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">could launch as soon as this summer</a>, and that's definitely plausible given the timing of the announcement. We'll know more when Activision makes its official announcement on March 4.</p>

When synced wirelessly via the included USB-C dongle, the Ultimate 2 reportedly offers near-seamless input recognition with 1ms latency. The Ultimate 2 also has a polling rate of 1,000Hz when using 2.4GHz wireless or USB-C wired connections. To be clear, the original Ultimate offered a stable and fast wireless connection, but it sounds like the new model will be even better in this regard. It's also the first Ultimate Controller to use a USB-C dongle instead of USB-A. On Android, the Ultimate 2 syncs via Bluetooth.</p><p>8BitDo replaced the Hall Effect sticks found on many of its controllers with TMR sticks. Like Hall Effect sticks, TMR technology uses electromagnets to provide a smoother feel with more accurate, precise movements. Electromagnetic controls also mitigate the risk of analog stick drift. Though similar overall, TMR technology is typically viewed as an improvement compared to Hall Effect tech. The new analog sticks are accompanied by customizable RGB lighting rings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449942,1300-4449943,1300-4449944,1300-4449945,1300-4449946" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 2 is the first controller in the series to feature four extra buttons. 8BitDo essentially combined the designs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate</a> with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0DM1WH5BV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2C</a>, the manufacturer's latest budget wireless controller. It has two remappable back triggers (like the Ultimate) as well as two extra shoulder buttons (like the Ultimate 2C).</p><p>8BitDo also added another common pro-style customization feature to the Ultimate 2: trigger locks. The Hall Effect analog sticks can instantly convert to linear buttons by flicking the switches on the back.</p><p>In addition to the physical modifications, the Ultimate 2 supports 8BitDo's proprietary app on PC and Android. With Ultimate Software V2, you can create up to three profiles and make adjustments to stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivity, modify rumble intensity, and program analog stick dead zones.</p><p>Like 8BitDo's other premium controllers in its flagship series, the Ultimate 2 comes with a matching USB-C charging dock with a compartment to store the USB dongle. While it's unclear how much game time you can get from a full charge, the Ultimate 2's battery is substantially larger than the original's battery. The Ultimate 2 has a 1,000mAh battery, whereas the Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch each have 480mAh batteries. The original Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth offered 15 and 22 hours of battery life, respectively, so the new model may offer a marked improvement to those already solid figures.</p><p>The downside to the Ultimate 2 is that it's limited to PC and Android at the moment. The original Ultimate 2.4GHz Controller eventually became compatible with Apple devices, so it's possible that will happen down the line with the sequel, too. 8BitDo typically releases Nintendo Switch versions of its Ultimate Controllers, so we may get a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch</a>, which is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">best Nintendo Switch controller</a> designed by a third-party.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

                <p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit Publishing, a company that specializes in re-releasing mostly Japan-exclusive 8- and 16-bit games on modern consoles, was recently accused of using existing fan translations in their ports without credit. The company confirmed that the charges are indeed true, and that it plans to "offer a means of resolution" to the translators whose work went uncredited.</p><p dir="ltr">The four games in question are Shockman Zero, Assault Suits Valken, Gley Lancer, and Majyuo: King of Demons. These claims were first made by <a href="https://krokodyl.github.io/post/2025/02/retro-zero/" rel="nofollow ">translator Krokodyl</a> on their blog, who cited identical dialogue in several of the games, as well as custom fonts created by fan translators. The most damning piece of evidence is in Gley Lancer, where the fan translator MIJET added their own name to the Japanese version of the game's credits, which you can find in Retro-Bit's version, clearly indicating that someone else's work was used. As Krokodyl notes in the blog post, Retro-Bit stated in a public Q&amp;A that it did not "utilize any existing script or work" for these re-releases.</p><p dir="ltr">"After our discussion internally we as Retro-Bit concluded that the final work submitted contained, to a lesser or higher degree, uncredited work," Retro-Bit wrote in a statement to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/retro-bit-apologises-for-using-fan-translations-without-permission" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>. "...This was an irresponsible oversight on our end and we take full accountability for this outcome and not verifying the submitted translation. To amend this situation, we will set out to reach those whose work was not recognized to offer a means of resolution." </p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit further said that it has delayed future re-releases in order to further investigate the situation and make sure it doesn't recur.</p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit isn't the only retro-focused company to get in trouble in recent days. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/limited-run-blames-supplier-for-nes-carts-that-damaged-consoles/1100-6529581/">Limited Run Games apologized</a> for selling cartridges that could damage NES consoles due to a voltage mismatch.</p>

                <p>Wizards of the Coast has seemingly canceled its AAA game project at the Skeleton Key studio. Very little is known about the game, but it was mostly likely in the horror genre as the studio <a href="https://x.com/SkeletonKeyDev" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">describes itself</a> as creating "thought-provoking moments of suspense and horror guiding players to have fun and face their fears."</p><p>Skeleton Key's audio director said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gamesound_opentowork-activity-7299748721108340736-Z85S?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAQgvBIBcue4YPrQMQ6FKHefNWcYQOld0Wk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he was laid off due to the game's cancelation</a>. It's unclear how many other developers were impacted or if Skeleton Key will continue operations. GameSpot has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for comment.</p><p>In 2022, former BioWare veteran Christian Dailey <a href="https://company.wizards.com/en/news/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-new-studio-skeleton-key" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joined Skeleton Key</a> as its vice president and head of studio. He was best known for working on the Dragon Age franchise. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-key-bioware-leads-leave-the-studio/1100-6485118/" data-ref-id="1100-6485118">became executive producer</a> of Dragon Age: The Veilguard after Mark Darrah left BioWare in 2020, but then handed off the role to Gary McKay after leaving to join Skeleton Key.</p><p>In 2023, Dailey <a href="https://skeletonkeystudio.com/1-year-anniversary-blog" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a studio update</a> for Skeleton Key's one-year anniversary, but didn't reveal any other details about the game itself aside from saying that it was still being worked on and that a physical office space was being built in Austin, TX. Since then, the studio has been silent.</p><p>Wizards of the Coast has already canceled projects in the past. Back in 2023, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/" data-ref-id="1100-6510284">company canceled at least five unannounced games</a>.</p>
