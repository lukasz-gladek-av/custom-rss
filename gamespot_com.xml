                <p dir="ltr">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> seem like they could be the most technically ambitious games coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. But neither surprised Digital Foundry as much as Ubisoft's Star Wars Outlaws--an open-world title that is current-gen only and never arrived on PS4 and Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Digital Foundry technology editor Richard Leadbetter opened up the discussion about Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 on this week's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">DF Direct</a> podcast (seen below). "I think this one's quite surprising, to be honest, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/">Star Wars Outlaws</a>," said Leadbetter. "This is like a technologically demanding game on the new Snowdrop engine for Ubisoft Massive. The concept that it's running on this class of hardware is pretty mind-blowing, I'd say."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EZZAr1c0Wqg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Leadbetter wasn't alone, as the rest of the crew seemed quite intrigued by Ubisoft bringing Star Wars Outlaws to Switch 2. In fact, Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it "a really exciting port, possibly an impossible port, if you will." That's because it's such a large game utilizing features like ray tracing. Plus, there isn't say a PS4 edition, while other third-party titles like Elden Ring and Street Fighter 6 did come to last-gen consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">All of that led to Digital Foundry video producer ​​Alex Battaglia saying, "This is by far the most technically ambitious game that we've seen mentioned as having been ported to Switch 2, like by far." The crew believes the Xbox Series S version of Star Wars Outlaws could give us a clue of what to expect on Nintendo's upcoming system. However, Leadbetter noted how Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora struggled when he played that on an Asus ROG Ally, since both games share the Snowdrop engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws originally launched on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in August and follows the adventures of Kay Vess in the Outer Rim. Ubisoft has continued to overhaul the game since release, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">dropping forced stealth</a>. Star Wars Outlaws has also received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/landos-back-in-star-wars-outlaw-wild-card-launch-trailer/1100-6527960/">story DLC in which you get to team up with Lando Calrissian</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release date for Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 yet, though it is planned to arrive this year.

Around 1,000 years ago, Miraland was embroiled in the War of Heavens against an evil force called The Dark, which sowed chaos and ultimately caused Miraland's destruction. In the present, The Dark are still around in the form of Esselings, which are hostile creatures made up of old pieces of clothing tainted by the Dark Essence.</p><p>Infinity Nikki is free-to-play and currently available on PS5, mobile, and Windows.

That DLC is available as a separate purchase."

The Master Trials' DLC added a Trial of the Sword challenge for players to complete, Hero's Path and Master modes, a travel medallion to simplify fast travel, and more. Then, The Champion's Ballad introduced more substantial story content. In 2021, a version of Breath of the Wild containing all DLC on the game card was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/zelda_breath_of_the_wild_and_splatoon_2_will_get_new_physical_releases_with_dlc_included_in_japan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in Japan</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 game card won't contain content from The Master Trials or Champion's Ballad, and players will have to buy the expansion pass in addition to the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of this game. It will cost $70, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-10-price-tag-for-zelda-switch-2-upgrade-packs/1100-6530664/" data-ref-id="1100-6530664">$10 more expensive than Breath of the Wild retailed for in 2017</a>.

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is whipping its way onto PS5 on April 17--or April 15 as an early access bonus for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-edition-preorders-are-live-including-a-collectors-edition/1100-6530384/">Premium and Collector's Edition preorders</a>--and several of the new features for the game on Sony's platform have been revealed. That includes the PS5 Pro features that will distinguish it from other console versions, including Xbox.</p><p>Starting in the controller department, the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive triggers have been tied to several parts of the game, including combat, exploration, and using Indy's tools. Bethesda added (via the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/11/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-comes-to-ps5-on-april-17-with-ps5-pro-enhancements/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Blog</a>) that the controller's lightbar is connected to game actions, with some examples being the LED light pulsing yellow if NPCs are searching for you or red if your health is low.</p><p>On the performance side, Bethesda explained that the game will benefit from numerous technical features, like frictionless loading, selective installation, and SSD optimization on PS5 and PS5 Pro. The game targets a stable 60fps on PS5 consoles, and if you find yourself stumped by any of the puzzles, you can consult the Community Game Help hub for tips on how to progress through certain
