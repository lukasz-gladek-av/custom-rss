                <p>Final Fantasy Tactics has returned after 28 years to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review-a-polished-historical-gem/1900-6418413/">phenomenal critical acclaim</a> in The Ivalice Chronicles, with fans both old and new reveling in the improved gameplay and actor performances that weren’t possible in 1997. As Yasumi Matsuno, the creator of the original game, wrote in a moving <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" rel="nofollow ">Twitter post</a>, Tactics comes to players in a time much like when the original was released--a time fraught with “inequality and division” that may leave many feeling “robbed of hope.” While Tactics is a fantasy story set in a fictional setting, developers did take a page or two out of real historical events, such as England’s War of the Roses in the mid to late 1400s. It’s bittersweet that history repeats itself now, but it does emphasize how relevant the evergreen themes of Tactics are, and how important Rapha and Marach Galthena’s involvement in the story is.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Israel and Palestine were also making headlines in 1997, the recent dramatic escalation of the situation has become a prominent global conversation today. With this escalation comes an <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/11/anti-muslim-hate-hits-new-high-in-us-advocacy-group" rel="nofollow ">uptick in anti-Arab sentiment</a>, making Rapha and Marach’s involvement in The Ivalice Chronicles that much more special to South West Asian and North African (SWANA) gamers like me. It’s also very refreshing to hear actors Elham Ehsas and Lara Sawalha bringing these characters to life so authentically because it’s no secret that SWANA coded characters have, historically, not been depicted in the most flattering or nuanced light--especially in video games. From Metal Slug to Counter Strike, SWANA coded characters have been one of three things: belly dancers, camel-riding snake charmers, or just flat out evil terrorists. Rapha and Marach tell a very different story--one that allows room for nuance and mirrors many of the issues that our community faces internationally, which was saying a lot back in 1997 and says even more in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Rapha and Marach are orphans who were swiftly brought under the wing of Duke Barrington, a powerful man who intended to use the siblings for their rare mantra abilities. Duke Barrington not only recruited Rapha and Marach as child soldiers for his war efforts, but he also indoctrinated and trained countless other children too, by opening orphanages filled with “a pool of willing young minds.” This allowed him to select the very best to "mold and train,” as Ramza puts it. It may sound cartoonishly evil, but this is actually eerily similar to how <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers" rel="nofollow ">the Taliban recruits today</a>. It is commendable that instead of framing Marach and Rapha as roadblocks designed to be cut down on Ramza’s journey, they are given a humanizing backstory that explains why they end up on a megalomaniac’s side of the war instead of Ramza’s. Rapha especially plays a crucial role in highlighting just how misled she and her brother have been, and tries her best to make him see that, in spite of his initial obstinance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4591506"></a><figcaption>Rapha confronts Marach about his belief in Duke Barrington.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4591506-ff%2816%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, despite how much care is taken in handling the Galthenas’ story, there is room for critique as well. It's worth noting that the siblings are the only characters in the game with mantra abilities; this feeds into an Orientalist trope, essentially exoticizing the only SWANA coded characters in the game. Additionally, the fact that Rapha and Marach are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/1nz6zt1/rapha_and_marach_are_terrible_characters_with/" rel="nofollow ">not well-optimized</a> at all makes them much less popular with Tactics fans. While this is relatively easy to fix with some respeccing, it still isn’t immediately obvious how to best utilize both characters in combat, and that could ultimately dissuade players from including Rapha and Marach in their parties, which is unfortunate and reflects some carelessness on the part of Square.</p><p dir="ltr">The other major critique I have is one narrative moment that paints an unflattering picture of Marach, specifically. When Rapha and Marach are first introduced in The Ivalice Chronicles, they are mid-argument. Marach is angry with Rapha for saying disparaging things about the man who he thinks saved them as children. When Rapha tells him she knows Barrington is the one who made them orphans in the first place, Marach slaps her across the face and says he “will not abide [her] ill-mannered tongue”. This seems to suggest that Marach is a fervent supporter of Duke Barrington and is enraged that anyone, let alone his own sister, would say a negative word about him. What this moment also does, is play into a negative stereotype about SWANA men being <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10857900/#:~:text=Arab%20Stereotypes&amp;text=Similar%20to%20Black%20people%2C%20Arab,i.e.%2C%20a%20physical%20threat%29." rel="nofollow ">‘inherently more violent’</a>, especially toward women. This scene makes even less sense when it is revealed that Marach actually wants to be free of Barrington, and is not intent on staying in service to him.</p><p dir="ltr">With all the changes and improvements that this version of Tactics went through, including a gorgeous script overhaul, I think there was room to remove the slap from Marach and Rapha’s argument to avoid unintentionally reinforcing a negative stereotype. It wouldn’t be the first time a character was re-examined in the Final Fantasy franchise. Cid in Final Fantasy 7 was originally implied to be <a href="https://youtu.be/KYWGfBjo0Ew?si=Fz8iAtOwEf9nkLbw" rel="nofollow ">abusive</a> in the 1997 version of the game, and has since been reworked to be an endearing, upbeat southern gentleman in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth.</p><p dir="ltr">While the original FF7 Cid was a pretty dour character overall, Marach, on the other hand, is a flawed character, but not a bad one. He genuinely cares for his sister, and even takes a bullet for her once he finally hears Duke Barrington admit to being the villain he has always been. After Rapha brings Marach back to life with the Scorpio Stone, the siblings both join Ramza’s party. For the first time in their lives, they actively choose what to fight for and who to fight alongside. It’s also revealed in optional dialogue when battling Hashmal/Folmarv that Rapha and Marach want that encounter to be the very last time they have to kill anyone ever again, which was unheard of for SWANA coded characters in the 90s and is still fairly uncommon now.</p><p dir="ltr">Although Rapha and Marach’s story is a bit of a short one in Tactics’ overall narrative, it is still impactful and continues to go against the grain by portraying SWANA characters as virtuous, imperfect people, like many other characters get to be. Would it be nice if their stats were better optimized? Sure. But in the grand scheme of things, the Galthena siblings are still great examples of how SWANA coded characters can be, and what I hope to see more of in future games.</p>

                <p>It's been a very good year for indie titles on Steam, even in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-has-already-surpassed-4-2-million-in-sales-report/1100-6534845/" data-ref-id="1100-6534845">blockbuster success</a>. Last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a> somehow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-briefly-outgunned-battlefield-6-on-steam-this-week/1100-6535685/" data-ref-id="1100-6535685">briefly outgunned Battlefield 6</a>. Now, another indie game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, has raced past 1.3 million sales in a single week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7mXFwVNX6Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H7mXFwVNX6Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>RV There Yet is the debut game of Nuggets Entertainment, and up to four players can join this co-op experience as they get behind the wheel of an RV home while attempting a very perilous side route through Mabutts Valley. The goal of the game is to get the RV past obstacles that it would ordinarily be unable to traverse. To pull that off, players will have to leave the RV and creatively use a winch and other tools to get by. As seen in the trailer above, some of those attempts can end very badly. This band of bros also has to deal with wildlife and snakes, which is why an EpiPen is one of their primary tools.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3949040/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, RV There Yet had over 100,000 concurrent players in its first week. Nuggets Entertainment community manager Jace Varlet subsequently posted the following video, in which he thanks players on behalf of the team. He also explains why the game wasn't marked as "early access."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2CaS-_47zI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/P2CaS-_47zI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In short, Nuggets Entertainment didn't expect this game to take off the way it did, and the studio just wanted to finish the title by its internally agreed-upon release date. There weren't originally any plans to add more content to RV There Yet, but that may soon change. Meanwhile, Varlet acknowledged that there are some bugs in the game and he pledged that they will be fixed.</p><p>There aren't any current plans for RV There Yet to make the leap to consoles, but it's currently on sale on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> for $7.19 before reverting to its regular price of $8 on October 28. Nuggets has also been concurrently developing another title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/among-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-631981">Among the Wild</a>, but it just isn't ready for release yet.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Minutes Of Halo Campaign Evolved Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Many wondered if Halo Studios employed some kind of artificial intelligence tool to help with this, but Microsoft has not confirmed one way or another, stating only that there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-wasnt-forced-to-use-generative-ai/1100-6535730/" data-ref-id="1100-6535730">no mandate that the studio <em>needed </em>to use AI</a>. In any event, executive producer Damon Conn said, "We've done everything we can to make sure that we preserve the heart of Halo as we rebuild and retouch everything."</p><p>The developers working on the remake said they were able to achieve this while keeping the "tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact" of the original game "preserved" for Campaign Evolved.</p><p>The remake makes some controversial changes, too, including the addition of sprint and some vehicle updates that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">one of the game's original designers is not too happy about.</a> Another developer who worked on the original Halo weighed in on the remake with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">different, more enthusiastic and hopeful take. </a></p><p>Campaign Evolved launches in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S and PC, as well as PlayStation 5. The franchise is synonymous with Xbox and has never appeared on PlayStation until this remake. It may not be the last Halo game on PS5, either, as Halo Studios has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-halo-games-will-be-on-playstation-going-forward-says-microsoft/1100-6535712/" data-ref-id="1100-6535712">"Halo is on PlayStation" going forward.</a></p><p>There is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-halo-1-remake-has-no-multiplayer/1100-6535707/" data-ref-id="1100-6535707">no head-to-head multiplayer support</a>, but campaign co-op will be available. Check out the video above to get a closer look at the remake compared against the original. Pricing for Halo: Campaign Evolved has not been announced, but it has been confirmed that the game will launch at the same time on all platforms, as opposed to coming to Xbox and PC before PS5.</p><p>Microsoft has said it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>, and another one might be a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/"> live-service Halo game</a> that could also release in 2026 for Halo's 25th anniversary.</p>

                <p>Video game crossovers and collabs are nothing new, but in many cases, they are predictable. That is not the case with the latest gaming crossover, as 2K has announced that Borderlands 4 is invading PGA Tour 2K25. These two franchises having the same owner is about all they have in common.</p><p>Season 4 of PGA Tour 2K25 will include a "Mayhem on the Greens" event that brings Borderlands to the golf sim. "Mayhem on the green incoming!!" Borderlands developer Gearbox <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1982862146821337246" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said.</a></p><p>The Mayhem on the Greens event begins Wednesday, October 29, but neither 2K Sports nor Gearbox have provided any details about what to expect from it. The teaser art shows a Psycho character wielding a special type of golf club that looks like it was made in the wasteland.</p><p>This won't be the first time that PGA Tour 2K25 features new licensed content, as the game offers a multitude of content for purchase based on real-world brands like Adidas, Sun Day Red, and Barstool Sports.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launched in September and had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">huge opening in the US, setting franchise records.</a> The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">first post-launch paid DLC</a> arrives in November, adding new story missions, bosses, and loot.</p>
