                <p dir="ltr">There's an old myth in the theater world that Shakespeare's Macbeth is cursed, and any theatre company who tries to put it on will endure some sort of misfortune during the production. One area that hasn't been tested yet, though, is video games--until now, as upstart Specto Studio, led by a former theater director, has announced Hail Macbeth for consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Hail Macbeth is a third-person narrative adventure and an adaptation of the classic Shakespearean play, where players will assume the role of an "unseen force" guiding Macbeth through the story. They will work against what the official announcement calls "the witches," which are "embedded into the game’s UI, subtly revealing or obscuring information, shifting perspective, and distorting reality in ways that make players question the limits of their control."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186" data-ratio="0.56289808917197" data-width="1256" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458186"></a><figcaption>Hail MacBeth concept art</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458186-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4458187,1300-4458188,1300-4458189,1300-4458190,1300-4458191" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458187-concept_lady_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458188-concept_macbeth.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458189-environment_stealth_mission.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458190-environment_duncan_bedroom.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4458191-environment_banquet.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unlike the original work, this version of Macbeth will be set in an alternate version of the 1990s, with castles, corporate high-rises, and “industrial ruins." The game's script, however, will retain the exact wording from Shakespeare's original work, and the studio has scanned real-world costumes and props into the game in order to "achieve a sense of lived-in reality."</p><p dir="ltr">Specto Studio is led by Paolo Sacerdoti, a former theater director, and the team is made up of "an elite team of game-industry veterans," with games like Detroit: Become Human, Horizon Forbidden West, Hellblade 2, Alan Wake 2, and The Last of Us listed among their previous projects. The studio previously worked on Roseline, the first-ever interactive theater experience in Italy, in 2018.</p><p dir="ltr">Hail Macbeth is scheduled to launch in Q1 2026 for "consoles and PC," with more information due "in the coming months."</p>

                <p>Saudi Arabian-owned mobile developer Scopely has announced that it'll be acquiring Niantic's video game division, paying $3.5 billion for the developer behind Pokemon Go. Also included in the proposed deal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/">which was revealed several weeks back</a>--are several other Niantic titles, like Monster Hunter Now and Pikmin Bloom.</p><p>"With Scopely’s full commitment, experience, and resources, we're going to make Pokemon Go the very best it can be--with incredible battles for thousands of Trainers at a time at our live events and new ways to connect to your friends and community, all while remaining focused on the excitement and experience of discovering Pokemon in the real world," Niantic studio leader Ed Wu said in a <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/post/moving-to-a-new-home-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "We have invested to empower thousands of community leaders and ambassadors who lead millions of Trainers to play together in the real world, and Scopely is in full agreement that this highly-admired program will be a priority to invest in together."</p><p>According to Wu, the entire Pokemon Go team will be retained through this new partnership, and Scopely offered the studio a development environment that it found "extremely appealing". The acquisition will still need to pass regulatory approval conditions, and Pokemon Go social companion apps Campfire and Wayfarer will also be included in the deal.</p><p>Pokemon Go was first launched in 2016, quickly becoming a phenomenon in the mobile gaming space. While the game saw healthy growth over the years, the COVID pandemic and lockdowns negatively impacted its popularity, leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-dev-cancels-marvel-game-lays-off-230-people/1100-6515579/">significant layoffs at the company and canceled projects</a> in recent years. This new acquisition is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-looking-to-invest-almost-38-billion-in-games-industry-could-acquire-a-publisher/1100-6507917/">several big investments made by Saudi Arabia in the video game industry</a>, as it has acquired stakes in major companies like Nintendo, EA, and Activision Blizzard through the Saudi Public Investment Fund.</p><p>Niantic says that the company will now transition into a new business--Niantic Spatial--led by founder and CEO John Hanke (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/scopely-pokemon-go-niantic-sale-3-billion-1236334814/" rel="nofollow ">Variety</a>). Niantic Spactial will be a "geospatial AI company powered by a next-generation map" that will allow devices to interact with the physical world.</p>
