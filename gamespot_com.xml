In the developer's follow-up to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/el-paso-elsewhere-review-you-keep-going/1900-6418120/" data-ref-id="1900-6418120">El Paso, Elsewhere</a>, PC players stepped into the role of former secret agent Alphonse Harding. Now, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners are getting their chance to play I Am Your Beast.</p><p>On June 25, I Am Your Beast will officially go live on PSN and Xbox Live. In the game’s story, Harding has left his life of espionage and action behind him, even when his former employers at the Covert Operations Initiative try to entice him back for one final mission. When Harding turns down COI, it responds by sending countless agents to put him in an early grave. As you might expect, Harding takes that personally, and he's the wrong guy to mess with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mWOwtXZW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/58mWOwtXZW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The newly released ports include I Am Your Beast's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-years-best-games-just-added-nine-more-levels-for-free/1100-6527982/" data-ref-id="1100-6527982">free expansion</a>, which was released last November. Nine new levels were added to the game, as well as an epilogue that gave players even more ridiculously over-the-top action. The epilogue is taken from the accounts of the few COI agents who managed to survive Harding's wrath, and in their retelling he has superhuman abilities that break the laws of reason and physics.</p><p>I Am Your Beast was ported to iOS earlier this year without the added features that were included in the expansion. However, the mobile version of the game is also receiving a major update that will make it "feature-complete" with all of the material included with its PC and console ports. But on any platform, it's one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">the best shooters to play in 2025</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft releases its own first-party Xbox games on Game Pass at launch, but Sony does not do this--and it's not planning to change that strategy going forward.</p><p>PlayStation services executive Nick Maguire told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> that Sony has "stayed true to our strategy across the board," and that means no day-one new releases on PS Plus. "We're not looking to put games in day and date," Maguire said.</p><p>Back in 2022, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan--who has since left the company--said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">"virtuous cycle"</a> of Sony's business plans for gaming would be "broken" if Sony launched its new games into PS Plus.</p><p>"The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p><p>The cycle, as Ryan described it is that, "the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which delivers yet more success."</p><p>However, Ryan also acknowledged at the time that Sony wasn't married to this idea and would be open to changing its stance based on market conditions. In the three years since Ryan said this, however, Sony has not changed its stance, and the new comments from Maguire make it sound like it's not changing soon.</p><p>Also in the Game File interview, Maguire was asked if Sony's ill-fated live-service shooter Concord may have fared better had it been released on PS Plus at launch. Maguire declined to comment on that game specifically, but he said PS Plus has "proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises."</p><p>Maguire said the calculus comes down to finding the "right time" for a game to enter PS Plus to help it reach a wider audience after its initial debut. This could help a game "find new fans" or reach "new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached," he said.</p><p>While Sony doesn't plan to launch its own games into PS Plus day-and-date, the company is partnering with third-party studios to debut new titles into the subscription service. FBC: Firebreak was a recent example of this. Going forward, Maguire said Sony aims to find four or five games each year to launch into PS Plus day-and-date, with Sony's own games coming to the service after a year, 18 months, or longer.</p><p>"That balance for us is working really well across the platform," Maguire said, adding that the four-to-five day-one third-party games each year is not a strict number but a ballpark estimate.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II Playstation 5 Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>PS5 owners looking to experience the full story can grab a deluxe edition of Hellblade 2 for $70, which includes Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice optimized for the console and its original soundtrack. If you already own the PS4 version, you can upgrade to the PS5 edition for free.</p><p>For the new features, players can once again take on the malicious Dark Rot in an additional challenge mode, and in the upgraded photo mode, several improvements have been made and an all-new "Motion" tab for custom cinematic video capture has been added.</p><p>The commentary tracks from the developers also sound interesting, as there's over four hours of audio from the game's cast, the Ninja Theory team, and people who helped the team to respectfully convey Senua's experience of psychosis. It's not known if studio founder Tameem Antoniades is included, as he is no longer with the company.</p><p>Microsoft has had many successful releases on PS5 lately, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-soon/1100-6531706/">as several of the best-selling games for April 2025 on PlayStation</a> in the US were all published by the company. Forza Horizon 5 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle have been big winners on Sony's platform, and Hellblade 2 won't be the only game arriving in August.</p><p>It'll be joined by Gears of War Reloaded--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/">which launches on August 26</a>--and the game will support cross-play and cross-progression on all platforms that it launches for.</p>

                <p>The CG animation and motion capture company Nintendo Pictures, formerly known as Dynamo Pictures, has been revealed to have worked on Sony's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-owned-company-worked-on-death-stranding-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC spotted</a> the company's name in the Death Stranding 2 credits. While it might seem surprising to see a Nintendo-owned company work on a PlayStation game, it's not totally unexpected. Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-buys-cg-studio-dynamo-will-rename-it-nintendo-pictures/1100-6505485/" data-ref-id="1100-6505485">Nintendo's acquisition of Dynamo in 2022 and re-branding to Nintendo Pictures</a>, the company worked on the original Death Stranding.</p><p>Since 2022, Nintendo Pictures' work on game projects has focused on Nintendo games, including Super Mario Bros. Wonder and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. But it's possible the work Nintendo Pictures did on Death Stranding 2 was done prior to Nintendo's buyout, or that a previous contract was in place to allow the company to work on Death Stranding 2 even as a company owned by Nintendo.</p><p>Another theory is that Nintendo Pictures' work beyond games is allowed to go forward for animation projects. After all, Nintendo Pictures did work for the Pretty Cure anime from Toei Animation following Nintendo's buyout of the company.</p><p>In any event, this isn't the first time Sony and Nintendo will work together, as the two companies are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-release-date-trailer-story/2900-6252/" data-ref-id="2900-6252">partnered up for the live-action The Legend of Zelda movie. </a> Sony Pictures and Nintendo are co-financing the movie, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-zelda-movie-delayed-by-nintendo/1100-6532279/" data-ref-id="1100-6532279">recently delayed a bit. </a></p><p>As for Death Stranding 2, it's available now for people who pay more, while the standard edition unlocks on June 26. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Diego Nicolás Argüello wrote, "Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is fixated on revisiting past ideas, which limits its impact to being a good but not great sequel."</p>
