                <p>You will soon be able to take control of future <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1 </a>updates, as developer TVGS has announced that the community voting system is ready. The first vote will take place "this week" according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546737172113263002?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Schedule 1 patch notes</a> on Steam for update v0.3.6.</p><p>As soon as the voting period opens, you will see a prompt in the game's main menu. TVGS has previously said that you can choose between adding the cartel to the game, a police update, or adding shrooms to the list of manufacturable products.</p><p>The news of the voting system rollout came in the patch notes for update v0.3.6--which sees <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/schedule-1-finally-respects-your-propertys-space-in-beta-patch-notes/1100-6531779/" data-ref-id="1100-6531779">employee beds replaced with lockers</a>--had previously been tested in the beta version of the game. Where employees used to require beds in order to be assigned to work in your property, they now only need a locker, which has a much smaller footprint.</p><p>Alongside the space-saving improvement, TVGS has also added item slot filters, which will allow you to tell employees which items you want or don't want in a particular place. The saving system has also been rewritten to lessen save times and optimize Steam Cloud Sync.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4509219-scheduleireleasetrailer0-21screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509219" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4509219-scheduleireleasetrailer0-21screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4509219"></a><figcaption>Schedule 1 updates in future could focus on an improved policing system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4509219-scheduleireleasetrailer0-21screenshot.png"></figure><h2>Schedule 1 update v0.3.6 patch notes</h2><p>You can read the full patch notes for update v0.3.6 here:</p><h3>Additions</h3><ul><li>Added lockers.
