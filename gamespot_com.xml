                <p>Earlier this month, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-new-alarmo-clock-already-has-a-day-one-update/1100-6527097/" data-ref-id="1100-6527097">announced and released Alarmo</a>, an alarm clock themed with sounds and pictures from some of the company's fan-favorite video game franchises. And while only Nintendo Switch games are currently available as themes, a hacker has already found a way to run custom code on the Alarmo.</p><p>A user who goes by GaryOderNichts--who is known for his ability to reverse-engineer and hack the Wii U--demonstrated his Alarmo hack on X by showing the alarm clock using a picture of a cat instead of one of Nintendo's chosen themes.</p><p>GaryOderNichts also posted a lengthy explanation about how he pulled off the hack<a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> on his blog</a>. The short version is that before he could get into the inner workings of the Alarmo, the firmware had to be decrypted and uploaded to an external USB. Removing the firmware file from the Alarmo allows users to get it to accept customized code via a USB. There may be limits as to what can be put on an Alarmo, since it wasn't designed to play games. But this could be an important first step for allowing users to upload custom themes of their own, assuming Nintendo doesn't find a way to prevent it from happening with future Alarmo firmware updates.</p><p>Alarmo is currently available through Nintendo stores and for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. However, the wide release of Alarmo won't arrive until next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo's new music app has already dropped</a>. which gives fans something to listen to as we await word about the Switch 2. </p>

                <p>A labor union representing game developers has harshly criticized Sony's recent decision to close two studios, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">including Concord developer Firewalk</a>, saying the gaming giant is acting in an anti-competitive and monopolistic manner.</p><p>In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/statement-cwa-following-studio-closures-and-layoffs-sony-interactive-entertainment" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said Sony's recent decision to close Concord studio Firewalk and mobile game outfit Neon Koi "makes it clear that now more than ever, video game workers deserve a free and fair opportunity to join together to form unions."</p><p>The video game industry has been rocked by mass layoffs and other significant shifts in recent years, and the CWA said the decisions to cut staff and cancel projects came from "highly insulated video game CEOs."</p><p>The CWA statement went on to claim that Sony continues to act in a monopolistic way through the closure of studios and elimination of jobs.</p><p>"Sony's decision to dissolve studios outside their walled garden of PlayStation-exclusive content rather than making games that have to compete in the highly diverse and competitive mobile game market should be a cautionary warning sign of Sony's interest in furthering its monopoly position in the video game industry," the group said.</p><p>Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad doesn't agree with the logic here. He <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1852021112399388939" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on social media</a>, "The argument doesn't hold in this specific instance. The studios didn't have dominant positions prior to being acquired. It was a consequence of poor management."</p><p>The CWA went on to say it will raise its concerns about Sony's "increasing monopoly and monopsony power" with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders in the future.</p><p>Nearly 250 people at Fallout and Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda Game Studios recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/" data-ref-id="1100-6525206">formed a union with the CWA</a>. This is part a wider trend in the video game industry of teams seeking collective bargaining agreements that seems to be picking up steam of late.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Kotaku</a>, the initial development contract for Concord amounted to $200 million--that figure was reportedly not sufficient to cover all game development costs. It also is claimed to be separate from costs related to Sony buying Firewalk and obtaining the Concord IP rights.</p><p>Concord was online for less than a month before Sony announced it would bring the game offline and refund all players. There was a period of time when some believed the game might resurface with a new business model or other changes, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">that is not going to happen.</a></p><p>While Concord the game is not moving forward, the franchise will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-to-remain-a-part-of-amazons-new-video-game-tv-show-despite-shutdown/1100-6526325/" data-ref-id="1100-6526325">still show up in Prime Video's video game TV series Secret Levels</a>, which premieres this December.</p>

                <p>Toby Fox, the developer behind Deltarune, confirmed that chapters 3 and 4 of the game will be released sometime next year.</p><p>"I'm very eager to show you what we've made since six years ago. Chapter 3 and 4 will 100% come out in 2025," Fox said on Twitter. "The specific time is still relying on localization and console porting.

However, we now at least have a timeframe on the game's future.</p><p>Deltarune is the follow-up to the wildly successful Undertale, and they both share elements with each other.
