                <p dir="ltr">While GameCube games never came to the Nintendo Switch Online service like many hoped, a few GameCube games managed to join the Switch's library in the form of ports, remakes, and remasters. If you're looking for a more authentic way to play those games, consider picking up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA GameCube-Style Wireless Controller for Nintendo Switch</a> while its on sale at Amazon for just $45 (was $60).

It also replaces the solitary Start button with the Switch's Plus, Minus, Home, and Capture buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the wireless model connects via Bluetooth, it's very likely to work with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2</a>, which supports Switch accessories.</p><div title="6530093 - PowerA GameCube Controller deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3249" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530093 - PowerA GameCube Controller deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20 ">PowerA GameCube Style Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch - Bowser</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20\n&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5BJ44G?tag=gamespot-promos-20 ">$21 (was $28)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>For a more affordable alternative, PowerA also makes a wired version that features a detachable 10-foot USB cable with a velcro strap for easy cable management.

Nintendo will open an official Nintendo store in San Francisco this May, and it's just the second Nintendo store in the United States. The other one is in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.</p><p>The San Francisco store is located in the city's Union Square area at 331 Powell Street. The store will be stocked with Nintendo game consoles and games, along with accessories, apparel, home goods, and souvenirs that are only available at the San Francisco location.</p><p>It seems fans won't just be able to walk into the store when it opens on May 15. Nintendo said there will be "reservation requirements," and more details will be shared in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Fans can enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip to the grand opening event for the Nintendo San Francisco store on May 15. The sweepstakes offers up a three-night, four-day trip for you and up to two guests.</p><p>The contest is open to US residents who are 18 or older. To enter, fans must have a Nintendo Account and can <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">redeem 10 Platinum Points to enter</a>, with a limit of five entries per person. The full terms and conditions can be found on <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's website.</a></p><p>In 2021, Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">closed its San Francisco-based office in Redwood City</a>. Outside of the US, Nintendo has an official store in its home country of Japan, located in Tokyo.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch later this year, with a big reveal set for April 2. That's when fans can expect to learn more about the system and its games, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">rumored Mario Kart 9. </a></p>
