The NPC roaming around in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/">the game's Simpsons collaboration</a> has taken out 33,000 players and counting, according to <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1986600289353515475" rel="nofollow ">the official Fortnite account on X</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fortnite account shared the hilarious Flanders statistic with <a href="https://x.com/harrybookTV/status/1985483543368122547" rel="nofollow ">a repost of a video</a> where Homer and Marge's neighbor eliminates players during a fight with a streamer. Like most NPCs in the battle-royale game, Flanders will retaliate when attacked.</p><p dir="ltr">The Simpsons crossover event with Fortnite started last weekend, changing the game's island to a map of Springfield. There's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/">Simpsons-specific battle pass</a>, including a skin of Stupid Sexy Flanders. The collaboration has gone both ways, too, as The Simpsons episode on November 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-just-had-a-bananas-fortnite-couch-gag-and-poor-peely-didnt-fare-well/1100-6535878/">kicked off with a Fortnite couch gag</a>.

                <p>The next BioShock game has been in development for the better part of a decade, but 2K Games parent company Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that there are no plans currently to cancel it. In a new interview, CEO Strauss Zelnick addressed the lengthy development cycle, promising that BioShock will eventually be released.</p><p>"It's going to come out. That I can say hand on heart, without question," Zelnick said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. The CEO added that with longer development cycles for AAA games, it had become more challenging to build a game that can stand out from the pack as part of its quality-over-quantity mindset. "The strategy of this company has always been to make the best entertainment, not necessarily the most entertainment. Of course, sometimes we've fallen short, but frankly, a precious few times," Zelnick boasted, adding that Take-Two is aiming to release "exceptional" games.</p><p>Zelnick's comments come in the wake of a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg report about BioShock 4 undergoing a partial overhaul</a> to improve on key areas. Meanwhile, Take-Two president Karl Slatoff also addressed the status of BioShock during this week's earnings call and spoke about changes at Cloud Imperium following layoffs at the studio. This led to the departure of studio head Kelley Gilmore, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-studio-laying-off-devs-as-diablo-boss-takes-over/1100-6534080/" data-ref-id="1100-6534080">with former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson taking ove</a>r.</p><p>"We've made some changes in the organization," Slatoff said (via <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" rel="nofollow ">Seeking Alpha</a>). "We're shifting some things around. But right now, we feel that the game is on a great track for us to deliver something that's going to exceed consumers' expectations. So not much more to update other than that and the fact that the next BioShock is going to take the franchise to the next level, which is always our ambition with all of our franchises."</p><p>In other news from Take-Two's earnings call, the company confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/">GTA 6 had been delayed to November 2026</a>, and despite being the third-highest-selling game of the year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/">Borderlands 4 has fallen short of sales expectations</a>.</p>

                <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is climbing up the sales charts, surpassing Nintendo's best-selling Mario Kart game ever. As part of Take-Two's latest earnings report, the company disclosed that the 2018 open-world Western sold another 2 million copies in the past three months to climb to 79 million overall.</p><p>In reaching that mark, Red Dead Redemption 2 has surpassed 2014's Mario Kart 8 on the list for all-time game sales. Mario Kart 8 has sold 78.02 million units--this includes 69.56 million units sold for Switch with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and 8.46 million copies of Mario Kart 8 for Wii U.</p><p>Of note, however, is that the Mario Kart 8 sales figure is inflated in a way that can't be said for Red Dead Redemption 2, as the Mario Kart 8 sales numbers include pack-in sales. Given that Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the centerpiece of Nintendo's annual Black Friday and holiday bundles, copies of the game sold in bundles are surely numerous.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is now the No. 5 best-selling game of all time, only beaten by Tetris (520 million), Minecraft (300 million), GTA 5 (220 million), and Wii Sports (82.9 million).</p><p>Given the immense success of Red Dead Redemption 2, many are expecting Rockstar to make a third game in the series. This hasn't been announced, but Rockstar founder Dan Houser--who no longer works there--has said he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-red-dead-redemption-3-will-probably-happen-and-hed-feel-a-bit-sad-about-it-because-it-was-a-cohesive-two-game-arc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expects Rockstar to make Red Dead Redemption 3 someday.</a></p><p>Sales of Red Dead Redemption 2 could climb higher still if the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">rumored PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 ports of the game</a> are real. Rockstar has yet to confirm this, but the ports are rumored to launch this year.</p><p>Rockstar's next project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>, which was recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">delayed to November 2026.</a></p><p>As for the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart World was a launch title for the Switch 2 and has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 9.57 million copies so far.</a></p>

                <p>One of the biggest stories in gaming this year is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">EA's pending $55 billion deal to be sold to a investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia. The sale could have ripple effects across the wider industry, and now Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has weighed in with his thoughts about it all.</p><p>Speaking during <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4839738-take-two-interactive-software-inc-ttwo-q2-2026-earnings-call-transcript" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>, Zelnick said he is "not sure" about how the competitive market could shake out if EA does indeed go private. This would leave Take-Two the last publicly traded company--of a certain scale--in the American video game business, an analyst pointed out.</p><p>Some have theorized EA going private could be a boon for Take-Two, but Zelnick isn't keen to assume that will be the case.</p><p>"We're always running scared around here. I'm fond of saying arrogance is the enemy of continued success. And I do think we're in a terrific position. We're performing much better than expected economically, and that's because we're performing better than expected creatively, and that's always our story around here," he said. "And if we can maintain that, then we have a wonderful future ahead of us. It is true that at year-end, we're really very under-leveraged."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Zelnick said it may be true that EA going private could give Take-Two "a bit of room from a competitive point of view," but that isn't clear at this point.</p><p>"We wish our competitors well. A good business is well served by having powerful players, not just one powerful player. So, it's possible that the competitor landscape shifts a bit; it's also possible nothing changes at all. Either way, we have to do our job, which is make the very best entertainment on earth."</p><p>EA's sale to Saudi Arabia's PIF, Affinity Partners, and Silver Lake has only been announced; the deal is not done yet and is not expected to close until 2026. </p><p>Take-Two's biggest announcement from the earnings results was that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar's GTA 6 had been delayed yet again</a>. The game was originally slated to release in Fall 2025 before it was delayed to May 2026 and now it's been pushed to November 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar said.</p><p>Rockstar has found itself embroiled in controversy, as the studio recently fired dozens of employees for what it called "gross misconduct." Rockstar said employees were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">leaking company secrets</a>, but a labor union says this is baloney and that the affected staffers were fired for attempting to unionize.</p>
