                <p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 was supposed to be available for preorder this week, but current events surrounding tariffs caused Nintendo of America to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/"> announce an indefinite delay in preorders</a> while it evaluates the situation. At first, that delay only included the US, but today Nintendo of Canada has announced that preorders in Canada will also be pushed back from their original April 9 date.</p><p dir="ltr">A statement from Nintendo of Canada was sent to multiple press and retailers confirming the move, stating that the delay was to "align with the timing of preorders to be determined in the US." The statement also confirms that the announced June 5 launch date for the console is "unchanged."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4472808-switch-2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4472808" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4472808-switch-2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4472808"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4472808-switch-2.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The preorder delays come after US president Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs to be implemented against nearly every other country in the world. Cambodia and Vietnam--two countries where Nintendo manufactures Switch consoles--were among the most-affected countries, with new tariffs set at 49% and 46% respectively.</p><p dir="ltr">Trump's tariff announcement is predicted to have a serious impact on the game industry as a whole, with the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/"> Entertainment Software Association releasing a statement</a> warning of their "detrimental impact."

                <p dir="ltr">There is still time to defend Midport Village from an onslaught of piglins.

Now we know it's for the console's new GameChat feature. We recently had a chance to ask Nintendo senior director Takuhiro Dohta a question about the button, and we've also learned what happens when you press it and don't have a Nintendo Switch Online membership.</p><p>Since the C button is used to connect to an online service, we asked Dohta what happens if you press the button and your console is not connected to the internet. He didn't tell us exactly what happens, but he confirmed it won't do anything... bad.</p><p>"Sorry, I can't get into the details of what exactly pops up or shows up when you press the button [when you're not online], but just rest assured nothing bad's going to happen," he said.</p><p>It's nice to know pressing the C button when you're offline won't do anything bad, but what will actually happen if you press it when you're offline? Time will tell.

After this, players will need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use GameChat. Anyone who is not subscribed to NSO and presses this button from April 1, 2026 onwards will be directed to a page with details on how to sign up for NSO, Nintendo's Bill Trinen told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553458/switch-2-nintendo-confirms-c-button-price" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>.</p><p>GameChat requires a NSO subscription because it's part of the "overall platform experience," Trinen said, adding that NSO is a "really critical piece of the Nintendo Switch 2 experience."</p><p>Trinen told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the idea for GameChat was to create a service that replicates the experience of being in the same room, on the same couch, playing games together--except over the internet via video or voice chat.</p><p>"And so for us, GameChat is why it's so important is the combination of being able to see their faces, being able to see what they're doing from a gameplay perspective and being able to feel like you've finally got a virtual space where you can have those same experiences that you might have in your living room," he said. "So that's why with the power of, I would say Switch 2, being able to finally execute that has been a big focus for us."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4472723" data-ratio="0.5060553633218" data-width="1156" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4472723"></a><figcaption>A look at GameChat with Mario Kart World.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4472723-screenshot2025-04-08at11.13.57am.png"></figure><p>The Switch 2 has a built-in microphone that can be used to chat with friends, while players can connect a USB-C camera to chat over video.

                <p>With Switch 2's $450 price tag, some have expressed that it's unaffordable. Well, Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser agrees, saying that those who can't afford it can still play the original Switch. Due to the recent Trump tariffs, it's also possible that Switch 2 could become more expensive in the US.</p><p>"We recognize there are some people that may not be able to afford [the Switch 2's] price point," Bowser explained in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/nintendo-switch-2-price-tariffs-1.7503598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC</a>. That's why we wanted to make the other Switch platforms available, so [people] still have an opportunity to come into our gaming universe, be a part of these characters in these worlds, and see value, if you will, in whatever rung of the platform they come in."</p><p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">defended Switch 2's price point</a>, saying that the cost of everything goes up, and also that its new features justified it. Nintendo has also previously stated that Trump's tariffs were not factored into the price itself. Preorders of Switch 2 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed in the US</a> as Nintendo reconsiders tariffs and market conditions, so some have theorized that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">system might actually end up becoming more expensive</a>.</p><p>Others have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1ju0g5l/nintendos_doug_bowser_channeling_the_ghost_of_don/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">comparing Bowser's comments to former Xbox chief Don Mattrick's from 2013</a>. Following the 2013 Xbox One reveal, Mattrick stated that those who didn't have a constant online connection for Xbox One could just stick with Xbox 360. He left <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/don-mattrick-leaving-microsoft-for-zynga/1100-6410944/" data-ref-id="1100-6410944">Microsoft for Zynga less than two months later</a>.</p><p>Despite the tariffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-stock-is-already-in-the-us-as-nintendo-prepares-for-launch-demand/1100-6530675/" data-ref-id="1100-6530675">Switch 2 stock is already in the US</a> as Nintendo prepares for launch demand.
