                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4</a> was one of the most-anticipated titles of 2025, and that helped carry the title to a record launch last month. According to Circana, Borderlands 4 didn't just set a franchise record in September, it also became the third highest-selling video game in the US for 2025.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatellaâ€¬ shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvn3gwbk25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the sales charts for September 2025</a> in the US, and Borderlands 4 topped the Xbox Series X|S and PC charts, while coming in at No. 3 on PlayStation's list. Specific sales numbers weren't included in the charts, but Piscatella noted that Borderlands 4 "generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in franchise history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3."</p><p>However, it remains to be seen if that momentum was retained in October. PC players have been very vocal about the game's optimization issues. Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenged players' negative reviews</a> on social media and even suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">they should get a refund</a>. Pitchford went on to offer optimization tips, while Gearbox has put forth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-stuttering-on-pc-gearbox-has-an-unusual-step-to-fix-stability-issues/1100-6535046/" data-ref-id="1100-6535046">an unusual step</a> to handle recurring problems on the game's PC port. The company subsequently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">new Borderlands 4 patch</a> to tackle some of the game's stability and performance issues.</p><p>Pitchford recently noted that the Borderlands franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-we-suck-and-heres-why/1100-6535409/" data-ref-id="1100-6535409">closing in on the 100 million sales milestone</a> across all titles. Borderlands 4 reportedly only needs to sell 6 million copies to reach that franchise mark.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gearbox has set November 20 as the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">Borderlands 4's first DLC</a>. For now, Borderlands 4's Switch 2 port has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

                <p>While Pikmin fans might not be getting a new game anytime soon, an upcoming update should give them some reasons to jump back into Pikmin 4.</p><p>Coming on an unspecified date this November, the update will add some attractive features to Pikmin 4, most notably a camera mode and difficulty modes that will make the Nintendo Switch game easier or harder.</p><p>With the new Field Camera tool, players can snap in-game photos and fully customize them with stamps, frames, and filters. Pikmin 3 featured a camera tool, but the field camera in Pikmin 4 looks more in line with camera modes in most modern games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtBDFzu9ZA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are also new "Creature Difficulty Levels," which is just Nintendo's fancy phrasing for difficulty modes. The easier Relaxed mode will make it so enemies won't attack unless they're attacked first, and they'll also be less difficult to defeat. On the other hand, Fierce mode will increase the difficulty, which is a great option for veteran Pikmin players seeking a greater challenge.</p><p>But the cutest addition to Pikmin 4 is the inclusion of Decor Pikmin from Niantic's mobile game Pikmin Bloom. Players can find Pikmin donning some form of decoration, like a ladybug toy costume, a pink doughnut, or an ice cream hat. No, they don't have any special abilities, but they're adorable as hell. These little guys can also be transferred to Pikmin Bloom.</p><p>A free demo is available for Pikmin 4, and it will be updated the same day as the full game. Unfortunately for Switch 2 owners, Nintendo makes no mention of any technical enhancements for Pikmin 4 on the new console, hindering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-we-want-to-see/2900-6488/#7" data-ref-id="2900-6488">hopes of a Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p><p>The announcement for the future update comes on the heels of the bizarre drop of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">animated Pikmin short film</a> called "Close to you." The video by Nintendo Pictures was initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-put-out-a-weird-animated-short-film-with-no-explanation/1100-6535274/" data-ref-id="1100-6535274">released in a cryptic manner</a> without any explicit Pikmin connection. Another version of the short came out not long after, adding Pikmin to the mix.</p><p>The video led to intense speculation about a new Pikmin game or a feature film, but it appeared to be just a separate project by Nintendo Pictures. In addition to announcing the Pikmin 4 update, Nintendo also released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full "Close to you" video</a>, featuring both versions of the short, on YouTube.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/news/">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> will officially launch on December 1, and two more characters are joining its roster. Tribute Games and developer Dotemu revealed that Phoenix and Iron Man will team up with fellow heroes like Captain America, She-Hulk, Wolverine, and Spider-Man, increasing the total number of playable heroes to 15. Phoenix--X-man Jean Grey's cosmic powerhouse alter-ego--can dish out telekinetic blasts, while Iron Man uses bleeding-edge technology to clear the field of enemies.</p><p>First revealed at Summer Game Fest earlier this year, Marvel Cosmic Invasion sees Earth's mightiest mortals take on Annihilus as he launches a new campaign to take over the galaxy. Dotemu had previously worked on another licensed property, the well-received Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge for PC and console.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itVLfmX3Ts8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589194,1300-4589195,1300-4589196,1300-4589197,1300-4589198,1300-4589199,1300-4589200" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589194-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589195-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589196-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589197-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589198-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589199-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4589200-marvel_cosmic_invasion_phoenix_ironman_7.jpg"></figure><p>The Marvel game has a beat-'em-up design at its core, and each character can pull off unique attacks. There's also the Cosmic Swap system, which allows players to harness each hero's superpowers and special abilities to create unique team-up attacks. Like its work on TMNT: Shredder's Revenge, the game has a pixel-art style designed to capture the spirit of classic Marvel games from the classic arcade era. Marvel Cosmic Invasion will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch consoles.</p><p>In other Marvel gaming news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/">Marvel's Wolverine recently got a big gameplay reveal</a>.

                <p>In a <a href="https://rollingstone.com.br/noticia/hideo-kojima-criar-jogos-e-cansativo-mas-sinto-que-estou-realmente-vivendo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent interview</a>, game creator Hideo Kojima kicked off a firestorm on social media as he shared his thoughts on the future of the industry. Kojima warned that relying too heavily on remaking old franchises is creatively risky and that, in the future, <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI will likely be used to create these kinds of projects</a>. </p><p>Kojima has already said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">he doesnâ€™t see AI as a threat</a>, though. Instead, he believes it can be a helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to focus on more imaginative work. Kojima explained that he sees AI as a "friend" in development, one that improves efficiency without replacing human leadership in creativity.</p><p>Silent Hill series producer Motoi Okamoto strongly disagrees with Kojima's prediction. Okamoto stated that <a href="https://google.com/search?q=gamespot+silent+hill+f&amp;udm=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill f</a>, the latest game in the franchise, could not have been made by AI. While AI might be able to generate ideas for sequels, Okamoto believes it cannot make bold creative decisions, such as changing the setting to 1960s Japan or involving acclaimed horror writer Ryukishi07. These choices, he says, came from human insight and vision--something AI simply can't replicate at this point.</p><p>"AI may be able to put together a project for a sequel that takes place in the Silent Hill universe, but things like changing the story's setting to Japan or getting Ryukishi07 on board as a writer are the kind of bold choices AI would never be able to make," Okamoto said (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ai-could-never-come-up-with-a-sequel-like-silent-hill-f-series-producer-joins-discussion-on-ai-generated-remakes-and-sequels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton translation</a>). </p><p>Silent Hill f is a significant shift for the series, moving away from the familiar town and instead focusing on a deeply personal horror story set in historical Japan. The game follows Hinako Shimizu, a teenager dealing with overwhelming pressure from those around her. Since its release in late September, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/" data-ref-id="1100-6535077">has sold over 1 million copies</a> and received mostly positive reviews. </p><p>The debate surrounding AI in gaming has gained momentum recently, particularly with advancements in generative AI, such as Sora. Fans have utilized these tools to create parody content featuring popular franchises such as Mario and Pokemon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sora-2-ai-mario-and-pikachu-videos-seem-primed-for-nintendo-lawsuits/1100-6535191/" data-ref-id="1100-6535191">sparking concerns from companies like Nintendo regarding copyright infringement</a>. Despite the controversy, developers like Kojima and Glen Schofield (creator of Dead Space) continue to advocate for AI as a valuable tool.
