This coincides with Microsoft also closing the curtain on its longrunning operating system, with Square Enix adding that players will still be able to "likely" play the game after this date.</p><p>"We have found that continuing support for this operating system is a difficult proposition," <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix said in a statement</a>. "You will likely be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems even after the end of support. However, after we discontinue support, we will, as a general rule, no longer be able to provide support for problems arising as a result of the operating system."</p><p>The publisher says that it may still respond to requests for technical support, but on a case-by-case basis. Final Fantasy 14 first launched for PC in 2013--PS3--back in 2013, which was when Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system was still in its infancy. Due to its long shelf life, it has naturally been updated for multiple Windows OS versions since then, and its recent Dawntrail expansion provided the game with a graphical update.</p><p>Regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/" data-ref-id="2900-5436">best MMORPGs of all time</a>, the game was ported to Xbox Series X|S last year. The strong response to it has led <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-will-bring-more-games-to-xbox-after-final-fantasy-14s-success/1100-6526160/" data-ref-id="1100-6526160">Square Enix to adopt a multiplatform release strategy</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-its-plan-to-reboot-the-company-over-the-next-three-years/1100-6531527/" data-ref-id="1100-6531527">company-wide reboot</a> that will unfold over three years.</p><p>Meanwhile, Square Enix's <em>other</em> Final Fantasy MMORPG is still going strong. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-considered-ending-support-this-23-year-old-game-but-too-many-people-still-play-it/1100-6531645/" data-ref-id="1100-6531645">Final Fantasy 11 still has a high number of players</a>, and the game a series of new updates throughout the year.</p>

                <p>Italian retro gaming YouTuber Once Were Nerd recently revealed that he was visited by Italian law enforcement, with concerns that his reviews of third-party gaming handhelds could be in breach of Italian copyright law. If charged, the YouTuber could face jail time or hefty fines.</p><p>The YouTuber revealed on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSEB4if2pJQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">channel</a>, as reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtuber-could-go-to-jail-for-reviewing-third-party-gaming-handhelds/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, that he is being investigated by the Guardia di Finanza, a law enforcement agency under Italy's Ministry of Economy and Finance. Armed with a search warrant, the agency seized his phone, as well as over 30 handheld gaming systems.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSEB4if2pJQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zSEB4if2pJQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The concerns center around third-party handhelds Once Were Nerd has reviewed on his channel, by manufacturers such as Anbernic and GoRetroid. The handhelds often ship with unauthorized ROMs of various retro games originally published by companies like Sony and Nintendo.</p><p>The agency is investigating potential breaches of Italian copyright law, under which it's illegal to promote copyrighted material via social media. Once Were Nerd disputes that he was promoting the devices, saying that none of his material was sponsored by the console manufacturers, and that he is simply providing impartial reviews of available products.</p><p>If officially charged, Once Were Nerd could face fines of up to 30 million Italian Lira and up to three years of jail time, as well as the threat of having all his channels shut down by the authorities. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

                <p>Later this year, Sucker Punch's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/" data-ref-id="5000-645132">Ghost of Yotei</a> will carry on the legacy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-review-you-khan-do-it/1900-6417501/" data-ref-id="1900-6417501">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. Nate Fox and Jason Connell directed both games, and they have a plan to keep Ghost of Yotei from making players feel like there's an overwhelming amount of things to do in its open world.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/ghost-of-yotei-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Fox and Connell noted that Ghost of Yotei won't feature a lot of guidance for players about where they should go. Instead, it will let players choose their own path through the game.</p><p>"The thing that Jason and I love the most is that moment when you're on your horse and you're looking at this big, beautiful landscape," said Fox. "And maybe the wind is telling you, if you would like to continue the story, go that way. But you see something out of the corner of your eye that catches your curiosity. And you say, 'you know what? I'm going to go check that out.' That moment where the game's not telling you really about where to go or what to do. It's you. That's the most beautiful thing about open-world games."</p><p>"We have this approachable, samurai cinema-inspired game, and so the trick for us as developers is to create a game that provides that extra level of creative freedom we strive for," added Connell. "Allowing players to enjoy it, while at the same time, we're never going to abandon the structure of the story."</p><p>Sucker Punch recently revealed that Ghost of Yotei will pay homage to classic samurai films, and it will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-brings-back-kurosawa-mode-adds-new-modes-from-samurai-film-directors/1100-6533108/" data-ref-id="1100-6533108">the return of Kurosawa mode</a>, which was inspired by the late Akira Kurosawa's movies. Connell and Fox also had a longer conversation with GameSpot about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-of-the-same-ghost-of-yotei-devs-on-striking-a-balance-between-familiar-and-fresh/1100-6533254/" data-ref-id="1100-6533254">striking a balance between Ghost of Yotei's new elements</a> and the familiar aspects from Ghost of Tsushima.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei will hit PlayStation 5 on October 2, and it will be released alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-is-getting-a-limited-edition-playstation-5/1100-6533106/" data-ref-id="1100-6533106">a pair of limited-edition Ghost of Yotei PS5 bundles</a>.</p>
