                <p>Nintendo has earned its reputation for being fiercely protective of its IP, including the Mario characters and the Pokémon universe. However, OpenAI's newly released Sora 2 has included so many Nintendo characters that it almost seems like it's inviting a legal response from the Japanese gaming publisher. Sora 2 is an AI-powered video and audio production tool, meaning that you can feed a prompt in, much like similar image generators, to create a video from your description.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The New York Times</a>, OpenAI has reached out to major copyright holders and Hollywood stars about being retroactively removed from Sora 2. It's not clear if a similar effort was made to reach out to Nintendo, but the sheer volume of Pokémon and Mario-inspired Sora 2 content suggests that the AI model was heavily trained on Nintendo's IP.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">i got into sora 2 and the only conclusion I can draw is openai is trying to get sued. this is like 99% of what it shows you immediately upon entering the app <a href="https://t.co/BkAXqchK2T" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/BkAXqchK2T</a></p>  — George Crudo (@GeorgeCrudo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GeorgeCrudo/status/1973531769535340950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nintendo's properties aren't the only ones that appear to have been fed into Sora 2. Others like Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Portal <a href="https://x.com/1ketaminepatch/status/1973278431275262230" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">have been mashed together</a> as well.</p><p>How will Nintendo respond?

It seems unlikely that Nintendo will let Sora 2 pass without taking action, especially since the company is famously litigious.</p><p>A report earlier this year suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-in-talks-with-openai-amid-lawsuit-against-midjourney-report/1100-6532702/" data-ref-id="1100-6532702">Disney is in talks with OpenAI</a>, but the house of mouse decided to sue Midjourney over allegedly misappropriated movies and images. George R.R. Martin and a handful of other authors have previously launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-thrones-author-part-of-group-suing-openai-claiming-systemic-theft/1100-6517884/" data-ref-id="1100-6517884">their own lawsuit against OpenAI</a>.</p><p>While more Japanese gaming publishers are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">embracing AI in game creation</a>, OpenAI, Midjourney, and other AI-related startups aren't acting in partnership with the affected companies. Nintendo has taken a cautious approach to AI, and Shigeru Miyamoto has said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">the company won't rush into AI</a> like other developers.
