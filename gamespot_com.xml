                <p>Actor Aaron Paul lends his voice to the upcoming game Dispatch, and it's the 46-year-old Breaking Bad star's first time working on a video game. He told <a href="https://screenrant.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-game-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Screen Rant</a> that, being an in-demand actor, he is often pitched various projects, and he tends to "just say no."</p><p>So what made him say yes to Dispatch? He explained that among the "stacks of scripts" and a sizzle reel of the game that was sent his way, one scene in particular "just really resonated with me."</p><p>"It's just these two characters sitting on top of a billboard, having a conversation, and I just, I just love the tone," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzRQrDK7zUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PzRQrDK7zUs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Paul then read the scripts and enjoyed them so much that he says he "couldn't stop."</p><p>"I really fell in love with the story. It's got to be on the page. And then I sat down with the creators behind it all, and really, really connected with them. And it was kind of a no-brainer," he said.</p><p>Dispatch also features the voice of Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright, along with Laura Bailey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">Matthew Mercer</a>. Creative director Nick Herman told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/14/aaron-paul-opens-up-about-dispatch-his-first-video-game-performance-it-was" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a> that he and game director Dennis Lenart singled out Paul as their top choice to play the main character, Robert Robertson, but Herman admitted, "We never thought Aaron Paul would do this." However, Herman said casting director Linda Lamontagne had a feeling Paul would vibe with the script, and indeed he did.</p><p>Dispatch is an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dispatch-the-superhero-themed-choose-your-own-adventure-begins-episodic-release-next-month/1100-6534803/" data-ref-id="1100-6534803">episodic adventure comedy game</a> developer by AdHoc Studio (a team composed of developers who worked on Telltale Games projects) that tells the story of a former superhero, Paul's Robertson, who is now a dispatcher for superheroes. The game launches for PS5 and PC on October 22, and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo is available now on Steam. </a></p><p>While this is Paul's first video game, he did star in 2014's Need for Speed movie, which was based on the EA racing game series.</p>

                <p>2K Games hasn't said much about its free-to-play third-person shooter currently in the works under the working title Project Ethos, but the game is not being abandoned.</p><p>2K Games shared a memo from 2K President David Ismailer today in which the executive confirmed that it has hired Ben Brinkman to take over as studio head for developer 31st Union. The company's previous boss, former Call of Duty executive Michael Condrey, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">left the studio earlier this year.</a></p><p>Ismailer said in a memo to staff that the feedback from the Project Ethos test in Fall 2024 was "enlightening" for the studio. "It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity," Ismailer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The executive said he believes the "renewed vision" for Project Ethos is one that is "poised to deliver on its promise to our players."</p><p>He went on: "Our confidence in Project Ethos grows every day."</p><p>Brinkman is a veteran of the shooter space, having most recently spent five years at Respawn as executive producer for Apex Legends. Before that, he was an executive producer for the Call of Duty series at Activision from 2008 to 2020. He's actually returning to 2K, as he was a producer at the company from July 2006 to March 2008.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">"delightfully different" but lacked an identity.</a> Exactly what this "renewed vision" is remains to be seen, nor do we know when 2K may share more details about the game or show it off again.</p><p>In February, it was reported that Project Ethos would have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">"pivot or be killed."</a></p><p>The hiring of Brinkman and "renewed vision" for Project Ethos comes just after EA announced that it was in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p>

Henry Jackman, who scored Battlefield 6, said in an interview with Hollywood Records that he was nearly finished with the Battlefield 6 OST before wondering if a collaboration with a rock group might benefit the game.</p><p>"There is definitely a bit of a rock thing going on," he said, referring to Battlefield's iconic theme. "Would it be completely crazy... is there any mileage in trying to think of some crazy collaboration with a band... that's obviously got serious rock credentials?"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMMkacVAoFg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMMkacVAoFg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A partnership would also require a group to be "creatively humble enough" to work on a collaborative project that is outside their wheelhouse. So Jackman thought, "What about Limp Bizkit?"</p><p>Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst says in the video that he warmed up to the idea immediately and that his aim with contributing to the Battlefield 6 OST was to, "Follow the yellow brick road until we get to Henry..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxJfLZVjT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvxJfLZVjT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Limp Bizkit's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-features-limp-bizkit-songs-including-the-series-appropriate-break-stuff/1100-6534876/" data-ref-id="1100-6534876">"Break Stuff" was featured in a Battlefield 6 trailer</a>, and that was pretty fitting because the Battlefield series is indeed all about breaking stuff via its trademark destruction elements.</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels.
