                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> won't officially launch until tomorrow, September 25, but PC users with early access have already released a handful of mods for the game. One of the mods even removes the franchise's signature fog from the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. And suddenly it's a much nicer day for high school student Hinako Shimizu, at least until something tries to kill her.</p><p>As demonstrated in the post above, the game isn't quite as intimidating if you can see everything clearly. Last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake also had <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/videos/51" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mod that got rid of the fog</a>. Some of the other notable mods for Silent Hill f include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/7" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hardware-based ray tracing</a>, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removal of the HUD</a>, and some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthillf/mods/9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">optimization tweaks for the game's engine</a>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is a departure for the series and the first game in the franchise to be set in Japan. The story takes place in the '60s and follows Hinako as she tries to understand why her town has seemingly been swallowed in endless fog and populated by horrific creatures. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/" data-ref-id="1900-6418411">review for Silent Hill f</a> gave it a 9 out of 10.</p><p>This game arrived less than a year after Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake. That title was so well-received that Konami and Bloober Team are joining forces again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/" data-ref-id="1100-6532382">a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. However, there's no release date set for that game yet.</p><p>Next year, the franchise will return to the big screen with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-will-hit-theaters-in-early-2026/1100-6532537/" data-ref-id="1100-6532537">Return to Silent Hill</a>, a film that will adapt the story of Silent Hill 2. Original Silent Hill director and screenwriter Christophe Gans returned to helm this sequel, which stars Jeremy Irvine as James Sunderland, Hannah Emily Anderson as Mary, and Evie Templeton as Laura. Return to Silent Hill will hit theaters on January 23, 2026.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Since Nintendo launched Switch 2 in June, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have emerged as the system's early flagship titles. Both games were also given updates this week, although Mario Kart World fans will notice more differences and improvements to the game.</p><p>Mario Kart World patch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68580/kw/mario%20kart%20world" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 1.3.0</a> makes a number of welcome changes to Free Roam, including the ability to play that mode with a second player if the game is full while trying to join a race against friends. It's also going to be easier to encounter UFOs and find collectibles in Free Roam, especially now that the game will let you know which items you've already found on the map.</p><p>The patch tackled a few annoying bugs like losing your ranking if you went out of bounds by the finish line, or getting stuck in the Bowser's Castle walls when using Bullet Bill. Most of the bug fixes would be best described as quality-of-life changes rather than game-breaking issues.</p><p>Surprisingly, Donkey Kong Bananza <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68614/kw/donkey%20kong%20bananza" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ver. 2.0.1</a> only tackles a few issues with this patch. Pauline's shout voices will now align with the player's chosen language. Prior to the update, there was a known issue where her shout voices wouldn't be played when English was chosen as the language for the system. The update also addressed a bug that kept players from claiming a disc as their reward for finding all of the balloons in Bananza Rehearsal.</p><p>A recent video demonstrated that Mario Kart World NPCs aren't above <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-characters-are-stealing-cars-gta-style-sort-of/1100-6534813/" data-ref-id="1100-6534813">a little GTA-style auto theft</a>. It's a funny touch, especially since the former drivers of the vehicles don't appear to react to the loss of their cars. As for Donkey Kong Bananza, the game recently received a roguelite mode DLC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-roguelike-mode-dlc-will-let-you-smash-stuff-forever/1100-6534690/" data-ref-id="1100-6534690">Emerald Rush</a>, which will let you keep smashing forever.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Mario Kart World Ver. 1.3.0 are below.</p><h3>General</h3><ul><li>You can now join friends playing "Knockout Tour" by selecting "Friends" from "Online Play" "1p."</li><li>Up to 2 players can now play "Free Roam" while waiting if the game was full when trying to join friends playing "Race," "Knockout Tour" or "Battle" in "Online

spectating in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless Play", you can now choose who to watch, even if you are holding the Joy-Con 2 or Joy-Con horizontally.</li><li>Decreased

jumps when landing on a rival from above.</li><li>Decreased the amount of time between when you finish and when spectating begins in "Knockout Tour" or "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play" or "Wireless

frequency of lap-type courses appearing in the selection when choosing the next course in "VS Race" and wireless races.</li></ul><h3>Fixed Issues</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue in "Online Play" and "Wireless Play" where the ranking would sometimes become incorrect if a player went off course at the same time as reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Grand Prix", "Knockout Tour", and "VS Race", where the CPU's ranking would sometimes drop after reaching the finish line.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" in "Online Play" where other players' ratings would sometimes appear as "0" on the results screen.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a Spiny Shell would sometimes pass the first place player in "Wireless Play" or "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be sent flying backwards a great distance when hit by a Spiny Shell.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the second item in an item slot would sometimes not disappear when hit by Lightning.</li><li>Fixed an issue where hitting the base of a pillar in mid-air would sometimes cause a large jump.</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused movement to become unstable when doing a wall ride on water.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes be swept away strongly after landing when doing a mini jump while going up a river.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes pass through the ground when hit by a car driving on the road.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Free Roam" where players would sometimes be unable to enter pipes correctly after exiting a trailer.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the results screen would sometimes become distorted after spectating "Balloon Battle" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes not proceed to the course selection screen after exiting a pipe during "Free Roam" in "Online Play."</li><li>Fixed an issue where Bullet Bill would sometimes slip through walls when used in "Sky-High Sundae."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck on a wall at the start of the race heading from "Airship Fortress" to "Shy Guy Bazaar."</li><li>Fixed an issue where players would sometimes get stuck in walls when using a Bullet Bill in "Bowser’s Castle."</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Cheep Cheep Falls" where item boxes were sometimes difficult to pick up when Smart Steering was turned on.</li><li>Fixed an issue in "Knockout Tour" "Spiny Rally" where sometimes there was an item box buried in the ground.</li><li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul><p>The patch notes for Donkey Kong Bananza Ver. 2.0.1 are also included below.</p><h3>Fixed Issues</h3><ul><li>Fixed issue where the player could not get a disc as a reward for collecting all the balloons in Bananza Rehearsal.</li><li>If the above issue is occurring in the game in Ver. 2.0.0 or earlier, the player will be able to get the disc right after the stage starts by entering Bananza Rehearsal after downloading this update data.</li><li>Fixed issue where some of Pauline’s shout voices would not play when language setting of the Nintendo Switch 2 system is “English (UK/Australia)” and travel buddy’s voice (Pauline’s voice) in “Options” has its “voice language” set to “Same as system.”</li><li>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li></ul>

                <p>Treyarch senior director of production Yale Miller has revealed that the company rejected collaborations with unspecified "big brands" for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> skins.</p><p><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-canceled-big-brand-collabs-after-backlash-3256095/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Miller told Dexerto</a> that Treyarch wants to have collab skins in Black Ops 7 that "make sense" for the game. This mandate led the company to apparently say no to possible deals.</p><p>"There are opportunities that we have had lined up that, after some of our conversations, we straight up turned down. Big, big brands, big things, and we're like, 'No, we're not gonna do that because it just doesn't fit,'" Miller said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998" data-ratio="0.55418381344307" data-width="729" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4573998"></a><figcaption>The Nuketown Block Party mannequin skins in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4573998-screenshot2025-09-24at11.28.28%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p>Some part of the Call of Duty fanbase has spoken out against the franchise's series of wacky and over-the-top skins, while others have embraced and enjoyed them. Miller said the recent Nuketown Block Party skins that let you play as a mannequin from the map are examples of skins that aren't "grounded" per se but something that "feels right for the game."</p><p>"All intentions [are] to stick to stuff that we can hand on our heart, say, 'Yeah, that feels Black Ops,'" Miller said. "That's really our goal. And I think that's a good clarification versus 'grounded.'"</p><p>Most Black Ops 6 skins <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">will not carry forward to Black Ops 7</a>, but it remains to be seen what kinds of skins--licensed or original--show up in Black Ops 7. In August, Activision acknowledged that some fans believe the franchise has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">"drifted" from its identity as a military shooter</a> with its wacky skins.</p><p>Activision made this key announcement against the backdrop of EA's stance on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> skins. Developers stressed that the game's cosmetics would feel "grounded." An EA developer even name-checked Nicki Minaj, which was no doubt a reference to Call of Duty's DLC that allows people to play as her.</p><p>Design director Shashank Uchil told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DBLTAP</a> that, "It has to be grounded. That is what BF3 and BF4 was--it was all soldiers, on the ground. It's going to be like this." Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>Call of Duty games over the years have featured all manner of outlandish skins, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloths</a> and licensed skins from franchises like The Boys, TMNT, King of the Hill, Beavis and Butt-Head, and I Know What You Did Last Summer. Many people enjoyed and embraced these skins, some of which included their own special modes, while others said they are a blight on the overall Call of Duty experience.</p><p>One thing is for sure, and that is that Call of Duty's in-game shop no doubt brings in a lot of money for Activision and the company will undoubtedly continue to sell skins and other DLC for Black Ops 7.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 14, but you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">play the game's multiplayer beta in October</a>. Just recently, Activision announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-also-includes-zombies/1100-6534980/" data-ref-id="1100-6534980">beta will include Zombies. </a></p>
