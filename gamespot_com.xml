The game launches for PS5 on December 8. Additionally, Microsoft announced that it's working on support for PlayStation VR 2 for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. </p><p>"To make this PlayStation experience truly shine, we embraced the immersive features offered by the DualSense wireless controller. Adaptive triggers respond to different speeds and surface types on the ground and provide sloped resistance in the air. Communications from air traffic control (ATC) play through the controller speaker, simulating the feel of a real cockpit. Gyro controls, lightbar support, and a customizable touchpad further enhance the immersion during flight," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5xeNotR5Hw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S5xeNotR5Hw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is not the first Microsoft game on PlayStation, as some of the others include Sea of Thieves, Forza Horizon 5, Grounded, and Gears of War: Reloaded.</p><p>Microsoft is bringing its games to PlayStation platforms (and Nintendo systems in some cases) in part due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">reported mandate at Microsoft to increase margins at all divisions, including Xbox.</a> There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.

                <p>Starbreeze has announced a new subscription program for Payday 2 DLC. The Payday 2: Subscription, as it's called, gives players access to dozens of DLC packs for a fee of $5/month or $20 for six months--the latter represents a savings of 33% compared to paying monthly. There is no annual subscription offering, however.</p><p>The subscription comes with access to more than 65 DLC packs for Payday 2, adding things like more heists, weapons, and cosmetics. Subscribing isn't taking over as the only way to get the DLC, however, as the game's DLC packs remain available to buy individually. </p><p>Starbreeze boss Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.starbreeze.com/news/starbreeze-launches-payday2-subscription-on-steam/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the aim with the Payday 2 subscription is to "give players greater flexibility in how they experience the game." The subscription is only available on Steam.</p><p>Payday 2 originally launched in 2013. A sequel, Payday 3, came out in 2023 but was marred with significant server issues upon release. Reviews for the game also didn't come in too strong, and remain "Mixed" on Steam compared to "Very Positive" for Payday 2.</p><p>Payday 2 appears to be preferable to Payday 3 for fans, as the older title has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thousands more daily players </a>than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the newer one.</a></p>
