                <p dir="ltr">Just like that, Nintendo has brought the entire Donkey Kong Land trilogy to Switch Online. Today, Donkey Kong Land 3 has (ahem) landed on the subscription service, though people are still pounding the table for Donkey Kong 64.

The side-scrolling title sees Dixie and Kiddy Kong in the spotlight as they search for the Lost World. However, like Donkey Kong and Diddy before them, they'll have to deal with the Kremlings throughout 36 levels.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8jS-HXN99Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U8jS-HXN99Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Not even two weeks ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-land-is-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-online-but-not-donkey-kong-64/1100-6527970/" data-ref-id="1100-6527970">Nintendo brought Donkey Kong Land to Switch Online</a>.

                <p>Humble has revealed its December lineup of games, and this month, there's a great selection of intriguing sci-fi, sandy action, and cyberpunk fun to pick up. In case you haven't used it before, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice costs $12 monthly</a> and offers several perks, including a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if your cancel your subscription. Other benefits include exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice December 2024 Games</h2><ul><li>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</li><li>Old World</li><li>Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand</li><li>Crime Boss: Rockay City</li><li>The Invincible</li><li>Moonstone Island</li><li>Inkulinati</li><li>Venba</li><li>Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip</li></ul><p>This month you can grab Bomb Rush Cyberfunk, a spiritual successor to Sega's Jet Set Radio. Like the games that inspired it, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk has a cel-shaded art style and it's set in a city where local gangs compete for clout by being as <em>extreme</em> as possible. There are various ways to get around New Amsterdam--from rollerblades to skateboarding--and you can leave your mark on the city with fresh graffiti. Assemble your crew, explore the five boroughs, and avoid the fuzz as you take on rival crews and strange enemies.</p><p>Another noteworthy game this month is Atlas Fallen, a solid action-adventure that recently received new enemies, quests, a reworked campaign, and a revamped progression system through a major update. It's a satisfying game where you wield strange powers to take on deadly beasts and cruel gods, so if you've been looking to pick this up, then this is a good time to do so following its overhaul.</p><p>For anyone looking to explore a seemingly deserted alien planet, you can check out The Invincible. Billed as a story-driven game inspired by the sci-fi stories of Piolish writer Stanislaw Lem, The Invincible is a philosophical look at humanity's place in the cosmos. Then there's Crime Boss: Rockay City, a bad game about pulling off heists and escaping with some sweet loot. It's basically Payday with a cast that includes Chuck Norris, Vanilla Ice, Danny Glover, Kim Basinger, Danny Trejo, and Michael Madsen, and reviews were lukewarm at best when it launched last year.</p><p>Other highlights this month include the cozy life-simulator Moonstone Island, medieval turn-based strategy with a unique look in Inkulinati, delicious storytelling in Venba, a colorful tale of burnt rubber and love in Monster Roadtrip, and incredibly deep strategy in Old World.</p><p>As a reminder, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the humanitarian aid organization Direct Relief. If you're looking to grab a few Humble Bundle deals this month, you can also check out the list below of what's currently available.</p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fscifi-shooters&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sci-Fi Shooters Bundle</a> -- 8 items for $19</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdisney-classics-black-friday&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Disney Classics: Black Friday Bundle</a> -- 17 items for $10</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fthe-telltale-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Telltale Collection</a> -- 8 items for $12</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Frawcember-to-remember&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-8-games-including-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-and-atlas-fallen-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528212%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Raw Fury: Rawcember to Remember Bundle</a> -- 14 items for $15</li></ul>

Developer GSC Game World <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/" data-ref-id="1100-6527951">released a day-one patch</a> to address some of Stalker 2's lingering issues. However, the title is still missing the A-Life 2.0 system that was initially promised on its Steam page. Now, GSC Game World is opening up about why A-Life 2.0 isn't in the game and how the Steam page was changed.</p><p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, creative director Maria Grygorovych explained that A-Life 2.0 is still in Stalker 2; it just isn't working as intended yet. The first Stalker used the initial A-Life--which was created as an AI program to give NPC characters in the world of the game a life of their own beyond any interactions with the players. A-Life 2.0 was meant to be the next generation of that program, if it can be made to function correctly.</p><p>GSC CEO Ievgen Grygorovych told IGN that as the game's launch date neared, the team attempted to shrink the area around the player affected by A-Life 2.0 before they encountered game-breaking bugs that forced the team to turn off the feature for now. Maria Grygorovych added that the change in the game's Steam description came from someone in the marketing department who made the edit without telling her. Both Grygorovychs also insisted that the developer is still committed to implementing A-Life 2.0 and ironing out its issues.</p><p>"For now we [are] committed to players to make it work and it can be done from directions both optimizing, giving more resources to A-Life, fixing bugs, making it work properly, and then putting more efforts to make it more advanced," said Ievgen Grygorovych.</p><p>As if that issue wasn't enough to deal with, Russian propaganda outlets recently began accusing of Stalker 2 of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/russian-propaganda-claims-stalker-2-is-drafting-players-into-the-ukrainian-military/1100-6528177/" data-ref-id="1100-6528177">drafting players into the Ukrainian army</a>. The documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> demonstrated how GSC Game World's team was affected by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Half of the team was forced to flee the country to finish Stalker 2, while the rest remained and some among them choose to fight in the war. Regardless of the game's ongoing issues, Stalker 2 has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">sold over 1 million copies across PC and Xbox</a>, and it remains available on Game Pass.

                <p>Ubisoft recently made the shocking announcement that it would shut down its Call of Duty competitor, XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco, and lay off nearly 300 people in what was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/#:~:text=In%20just%20the%20first%20two,a%20developer%20at%20Riot%20Games." data-ref-id="1100-6521799">just the latest unfortunate development for the people who make video games in this business</a>. Now, internal memos from CEO Yves Guillemot and chief studios boss Marie-Sophie de Waubert have emerged.</p><p>Guillemot said in a memo obtained by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-about-xdefiant-closure-and-the-future-of-ubisoft/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> that the decision to cancel XDefiant, close Ubisoft San Francisco and Osaka, and ramp down its Sydney office was "among the most difficult decisions we've had to make." Guillemot praised the XDefiant development team and its ambition to "challenge the best shooter on the market." However, "it was not enough," he admitted.</p><p>For those being laid off, Guillemot said he expresses his "deepest gratitude" and that the company will do "everything possible" to help affected staffers.</p><p>Guillemot went on to say Ubisoft is indeed going through "turbulent times," adding that he is working with his executive team to find the "best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny." When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">Ubisoft's stock price</a> began to tank earlier this year, some theorized the lower company value might make the company an acquisition target.</p><p>In October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a report claimed Ubisoft was talking to Tencent about all manner of options</a>, including turning Ubisoft private or having Tencent acquire the company. Nothing has materialized from this as of yet, but Guillemot's wording about being able to "maintain control of our destiny" suggests something may be afoot, or perhaps it doesn't mean that at all.</p><p>"I'm doing everything I can to help us regain momentum, so that we can continue to make Ubisoft a key player in our industry, a creator known for its unique and exceptional video games," Guillemot said in his memo to staff.</p><p>As for the memo to staff sent by Marie-Sophie de Waubert, it was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">published on Ubisoft's own public website</a> and shed some additional light on what happened with XDefiant. She said the game had an "encouraging start" but failed to "attract and retain" enough players.</p><p>"The game is too far away from reaching the results required to enable further significant investment, and we are announcing that we will be sunsetting it," she said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that Ubisoft's lack of success with XDefiant doesn't mean the company will stop pursuing games-as-a-service titles. In fact, she said games-as-a-service remains "a pillar of of strategy," citing examples of success like Rainbow Six, The Crew, and For Honor.</p><p>"It's a highly competitive market, and we will apply the lessons learned with XDefiant to our future live titles," she said.</p><p>XDefiant was developed by Ubisoft San Francisco, and about half of the developers are shifting to other projects within Ubisoft as a result of the game's shutdown. The game was produced by Call of Duty veteran Mark Rubin and launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-launch-reportedly-hit-1-million-players-in-under-3-hours/1100-6523688/" data-ref-id="1100-6523688">attracting lots of players right out of the gate.</a> The momentum could not be sustained, however. On October 15, Rubin responded to claims that XDefiant would shut down after Season 4, saying there were <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1846272225491484763" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no plans to do that and in fact, he was already planning content for the game's second year.</a></p><p>De Waubert also teased larger, structural changes coming to Ubisoft in the future in the areas of production and business practices. Guillemot, for his part, said in his memo that Ubisoft will try to have "fewer unnecessary processes" so its workers can focus more on making games.</p><p>These latest layoffs at Ubisoft come after a previously announced cost-cutting program that already resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">more than 1,000 layoffs at the company.</a></p>
