                <p dir="ltr">Today at CES 2025, AMD announced its new 9070-series graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. While the company did not reveal prices or availability for these new components, it did offer a preview of the new GPUs' features and performance.</p><p dir="ltr">Specific specs were not disclosed during the company's presentation, both the Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 are built on AMD's RDNA 4 architecture, featuring AMDâ€™s second-gen AI accelerators, second-gen radiance display engine, and third-gen ray-tracing accelerators. AMD claims the performance benchmarks will be roughly in the range of Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. That would put the RX 9070 series within a mid-range line of GPUs, rather high-end models--though we're curious to see how they'll stack up against Nvidia's upcoming RTX 5000-series GPUs, which are also expected to be unveiled at CES this week.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423407"></a><figcaption>Several manufacturers are readying Radeon 9070 series GPUs for launch early this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423407-9070info.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What was confirmed, however, is that the GPUs' RNA 4 architecture will support the new FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4) AI-powered resolution upscaling, which AMD also previewed at CES. FSR is similar to Nvidia's DLSS and PS5 Pro's PSSR upscaling tech (which was based on FSR), but FSR 4 is built specifically for the RX 9070 series' new AI accelerators. FSR 4 will launch alongside the new Radeon 9070 GPUs and will support any games that already use FSR 3.1 and above, including Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, as confirmed by Microsoft's Matt Booty during AMD's presentation. The company did not specify how FSR 4 upscaling will compare to its current FSR 3.5 or Nvidia's DLSS.</p><p dir="ltr">AMD did not reveal prices or specific release dates for the Radeon RX 9070 GPUs, but the first wave is expected to launch in Q1 2025, with models planned from multiple manufacturers, including Acer, Asus, ASRock, Gigabyte, and more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">New Ryzen 9 Flagship CPUs</h2><p dir="ltr">Alongside these new GPUs, AMD also unveiled its new flagship desktop CPUs, the Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D, during its CES 2025 presentation. Pricing and specific release date were once again not confirmed, but we did get a more concrete release window of March 2025, and a clearer overview of its specs and performance.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423406"></a><figcaption>AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D CPU</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4423406-ryzen.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D features 16 Zen 5 CPU cores (32 threads), a maximum boost frequency of 5.7GHz, 144MB of total cache, and 170 watt TDP. The Ryzen 9 9900X3D features 12 cores (24 threads), a 5.5GHz maximum boost, 140MB of cache, and a 120-watt TDP. AMD says the Ryzen 9 9950X3D is 10% faster on average than Intel's current Core Ultra 9 285K flagship CPU, and up to 20% faster for gaming. Its gaming performance benchmarks are also within 1% of AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D, which is widely considered the best gaming CPU currently on the market--and one that is notoriously difficult to find in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ryzen 9 9950X3D and Ryzen 9 9900X3D are both set to launch in March, but no prices have been revealed yet.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're in the market for an AMD processor but don't want to wait, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-9800X3D-16-Thread-Desktop-Processor/dp/B0DKFMSMYK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has restocked the popular Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU for $479</a>.

                <p>Ghost of Tsushima, the critically acclaimed PlayStation title that sees players take on the role of a samurai defending his homeland, is getting an anime adaptation. Announced at 2025's Consumer Electronics Show, the upcoming series seeks to "offer fans an exciting new way to experience the game" alongside "bold and groundbreaking animation." As such, Sony Music and PlayStation Studios are collaborating with anime distributor Crunchyroll and Demon Slayer studio Aniplex to bring the show to life.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png" data-ref-id="1300-4423434" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png" data-ref-id="1300-4423434"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Tsushima Legends art included in the anime series press release.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4423434-ps2slim.png"></figure><p>According to the series' press release, the upcoming show will not focus on Ghost of Tsushima main character Jin Sakai. Instead, it will adapt the game's Legends mode, a later addition to Ghost of Tsushima that introduced four-person co-op. In Legends mode, four characters--a samurai, a ronin, an assassin, and a hunter--band together to fight off creatures born from Japanese myths and legends, making for an experience that leans farther into the surreal and supernatural than the base game.</p><p>As of right now, many details about the upcoming series--such as its official name--are being kept under wraps. However, the studios did offer a tentative release window of 2027 and an announcement that the show will be a Crunchyroll exclusive.</p><p>The Ghost of Tsushima animated series is yet another one of PlayStation Studio's many video game adaptations that are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-a-look-at-the-playstation-productions-movie-animation-that-runs-before-uncharted/1100-6500707/" data-ref-id="1100-6500707">currently in the works</a>. Funnily enough, one of the most notable of these is John Wick creator Chad Stahelski's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-from-john-wicks-chad-stahelski-is-in-the-works/1100-6489332/" data-ref-id="1100-6489332">Ghost of Tsushima movie</a>, which is presumably still in the works. However, and as head of PlayStation Productions Asad Qizilbash noted, this series marks the studio's first anime adaptation.</p><p>"Having already proven the immense quality and versatility of our gaming properties across multiple successful film and television projects, we couldnâ€™t be more excited to announce our first ever anime adaptation," Qizilbash stated. "Ghost of Tsushima's rich, immersive world and its fantastical Legends mode based on Japanese mythology provide the perfect canvas for this project, and Aniplex is the perfect partner to translate Sucker Punch Productions' hit video game into a stunning new anime series."</p>

It isn't the first officially licensed Lego board game, but it is the only one still in print at the moment. Older Lego board games tend to sell for rather high prices, so it'd be wise to add Monkey Palace to your collection sooner rather than later.</p>                      </div><p>What happens when a monkey stumbles upon an ancient palace in the jungle but decides to redecorate their new home? The entire place collapses, of course, so now you and up to three other players need to rebuild the structure from scratch.</p><p>To help the monkey live large again, humans take turns adding Lego pieces to makeshift staircases. Each piece is worth a certain number of Monkey Credits, which are exchanged for Monkey Cards. The Monkey Card you choose to play determines which brick type(s) you use to make and decorate the staircases. As you build, you rack up Banana Points, which are counted at the end of the game to determine the winner. Games last roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>Monkey Palace comes with 231 bricks and multiple game boards, each of which presents their own unique challenges and adds replay value.
