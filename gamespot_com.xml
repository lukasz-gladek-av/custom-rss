                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s loot grind is getting some major changes in its next expansion, including adjustments to make more activities more rewarding and to make gear more viable in the game's new Portal activity scoring system.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced several of the changes in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ?si=ZeoppwP1tjmrSn4-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming Renegades expansion, noting that many of them are responses to feedback from players in the wake of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion. Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p>

                <p>Some of the best games around borrow from those that set the standard before them, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311"> Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel, is no exception. Protagonist Hornet differs from the first game's Vessel in a number of ways but also features some familiar-looking animations that might remind you of one of the most influential metroidvanias of all time.</p><p>If you've enjoyed flicking Hornet about on the screen, you may have noticed a curious movement she makes when changing direction. Instead of the character model flipping to the new direction you're moving in, Hornet backsteps and looks like she's turning to face it instead. Line that up against Alucard in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/" data-ref-id="5000-632"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, and it's obvious where this inspiration came from.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was going to praise Silksong for having animations similar to Alucard's, but seeing them side by side, it's the same character controller lol (I love that, by the way) <a href="https://t.co/gQLJ2yNlwS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gQLJ2yNlwS</a></p>  — Wallace Pires (@h_wallacepires) <a href="https://twitter.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>More of Hornet's animations, such as her standard and diagonal air attacks, bear some similarity to Alucard's own, but it's the backstep that looks almost ripped out of Konami's classic and endearingly recreated in its modern contemporary. Team Cherry hasn't commented on the comparison yet, but it's a nice touch that longtime fans of the genre are bond to appreciate the most.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong hasn't been out for a week yet, but it's already made a massive impact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">bringing down several storefronts</a> at launch before going on to secure more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">5 million players in total</a>. It's already generated some discussion over its difficulty and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">received a balance update</a> that should make early encounters a little less punishing, as well as a hidden mode that makes skirmishes even more brutal.</p>

                <p>As part of Apple's big September event today, the company did what it usually does in September: announced a new iPhone. In fact, Apple unveiled four new iPhone models, including the "impossibly thin" iPhone Air and the more powerful iPhone 17 Pro. The others include the iPhone 17 Pro Max and a new base-model iPhone 17. All of them are launching on September 19, with preorders opening September 12.</p><p>Here are the starting prices at a glance, but note that prices go up based on the storage space you choose:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone 17</strong> -- $800</li><li><strong>iPhone Air</strong> -- $1000</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong> -- $1,100</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong> -- $1,200</li></ul><h2>iPhone Air</h2><p>At 5.6mm, it's the thinnest iPhone that Apple has ever made. It features a 6.5-inch screen and is said to be durable thanks in part to being made with titanium (80% of which comes from recycled sources).</p><p>The iPhone Air comes in black, white, gold, and blue. It runs on the A19 Pro processor, which sets new stands for mobile phones, Apple said. The GPU, meanwhile, gets improved with a 5-core setup and baked-in AI acceleration features. Users can expect "Macbook Pro levels of compute," Apple said.</p><p>The camera takes 48 megapixel photos with one lens and an 18mp front-facing camera that includes a "center stage" feature that uses AI to find the best angles. A new feature, dual capture video, allows you to record yourself with the front-facing camera while recording with the back camera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580" data-ratio="0.56631171345595" data-width="2066" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580"></a><figcaption>The iPhone Air.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Apple said the internal design has been "completely redesigned" to maximum space for the battery itself. Apple promises "all-day battery life" for the iPhone Air. There is also a MagSafe battery accessory that people can buy to extend battery life.</p><h2>iPhone 17 Pro</h2><p>The iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery in any iPhone, a new camera system with "breathtaking range and resolution," and the most powerful chip Apple has ever made for an iPhone, the A19 Pro. It's designed to be extremely durable, Apple said, with new protections for the front and the back. It also has a better battery that can support up to 39 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p><p>Take a look for yourself:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586"></a><figcaption>The iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of the new cameras, they include the "best camera system we've ever made," Apple said, and they include the 18mp "center stage" camera on the front and three rear cameras--all are 48 megapixels. The "extended plateau" for the camera allows for the longest optical zoom Apple has ever made.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 17 base model</strong></h2><p>The new line of iPhone 17 base-model phones will run on a new processor called A19, which is "faster and more efficient," Apple said. The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3-inch display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming. NetEase's Destiny: Rising will be among the games to support the 120Hz feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576" data-ratio="0.58842443729904" data-width="1866" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576"></a><figcaption>The four new iPhone 17 colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png"></figure><p>A big part of having a phone is taking photos of your dog with it, and the new iPhone 17 will feature a better camera that should take more impressive photos than before, Apple said. There is a new "center stage" camera, too, to help people take better selfies, videos, and more. You also no longer need to rotate your phone to take a selfie, and the camera uses AI to automatically select the best angles.</p><p>Below you can see a rundown of the iPhone 17 base model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578" data-ratio="0.58230256898192" data-width="2102" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578"></a><figcaption>A quick look at the special features of the iPhone 17.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png"></figure><p>Also during the Apple event, the company announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p>

                <p>Pablo Sanchez fans, rejoice. After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/" data-ref-id="1100-6525954">reviving the Backyard Sports name</a> and releasing three games in the quirky and cartoony series, publisher Playground Productions has launched Backyard Football '99 on Steam and mobile platforms. As with the original release, the football game stars a colorful cast of child athletes, along with younger versions of actual NFL legends.</p><p>Real-life players Barry Sanders, Dan Marino, Drew Bledsoe, Jerry Rice, John Elway, Randall Cunningham, and Steve Young are once again in the Backyard Football roster, though this modern remaster notably lacks Brett Favre. Developer Mega Cat Studios ended up replacing Favre with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2J9qBR1erE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original character Chase Downfield</a>, which marks the first time these remasters have introduced a new kid.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVqWQf22CCI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVqWQf22CCI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While most of the kiddified professional football players are back, the game lacks any imagery or references to the NFL. The original 1999 release of Backyard Football let players use actual NFL team names, logos, and colors. Instead, players can form teams like the Labrador Receivers, the Dirty Socks, or the Ticklish Tornados. Interestingly, Backyard Baseball '01, which was released on Steam in July, includes MLB teams and references.</p><p>But despite being bereft of Brett Favre and any NFL iconography, Backyard Football '99 should still prove to be a familiar and nostalgic romp for those who played the original game on CD-ROM thanks to its faithful visuals and audio.</p><p>"Backyard Football ‘99 made me a football fan for life. From learning plays to managing teams, this game made football accessible, fun, and exciting for all ages," said CEO of Playground Productions Lindsay Barnett in a press release marking the remaster's release. "I am so proud to bring it back in time for football season."</p><p>Next up for Playground Productions and Backyard Sports are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-continues-comeback-with-five-more-titles-on-the-way/1100-6527118/" data-ref-id="1100-6527118">re-releases of Backyard Basketball '01</a> and Backyard Hockey '02, though there are no announced release dates for either title yet.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
