                <p>Oh, snap! Second Dinner has officially announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-snap/">Marvel Snap</a>: <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/18/marvel-snaps-golden-gauntlet-world-championship-series-gives-players-a-new-way-to-compete-connect-and-shine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series</a>, a global tournament initiative launching on August 9, 2025. This free-to-enter competition is open to all players regardless of rank or experience and is aimed at bringing together the community and showcasing players' creativity. The series will be broadcast live on the game's official Twitch and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> channels.</p><p>Registration links will be shared on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/marvelsnap" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Discord</a> ahead of each event, along with full rules, format, and support in dedicated channels. </p><p>The Golden Gauntlet Series will include three regional "Open Qualifier" tournaments, leading up to a global finals event in November called the Golden Gauntlet Worlds. Each regional event will follow a standardized format: Six rounds of Swiss-style playing (a fixed number of rounds, with pairings based on performance rather than elimination), followed by a top 16 single-elimination bracket, with prizes awarded to the top finishers.</p><p>After that, players who end those rounds with a 5-1 record or better will earn a spot in the final event. These qualifiers are scheduled for August, September, and October, each focusing on different global regions, ensuring as many players as possible.</p><p>Aland Failde, SVP of marketing at Second Dinner, emphasized that the tournament is a way to give back to fans and creators who have shaped the game's journey.</p><p>"From day one, Marvel Snap has been shaped by its players, and the Golden Gauntlet is our way of supporting and amplifying that passion," Failde said in a statement. "Huge shoutout to Game On Events for helping us host this event and to all the incredible community members who've helped bring this to life--this series wouldn't exist without their dedication, creativity, and love for the game."</p><p>Snap players might remember when the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-snap-gets-caught-up-in-tiktok-ban-currently-unavailable-in-the-us/1100-6528894/" data-ref-id="1100-6528894">went temporarily offline</a> this past January due to the implementation of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA). The legislation banned software owned or published by ByteDance, which owns the game's then-publisher Nuverse. The restrictions were later removed, and the developers announced that they would work with US company Skystone Games to bring publishing duties in-house.</p><p>Similarly, Matthew R.--also known for his gamertag ItsGuestGaming--co-founder of Game On Events, highlighted the tournament's evolution from grassroots efforts to a full-fledged world championship.</p><p>â€œOur goal with this series is to bring the community together to celebrate Marvel Snap's competitive scene while showcasing the fast, high-stakes nature of its matches," he said. "It's been exciting to watch tournaments grow from grassroots events to the Golden Gauntlet World Championship Series. Whether you've been playing for two months or two years, we're thrilled to host a tournament that honors Marvel Snap's amazing community."</p><p>The grand finale, Golden Gauntlet Worlds, will take place on November 8, 2025, featuring over 300 qualified players from the three open tournaments. This final event will consist of nine rounds of Swiss play, culminating in a Top 16 playoff to determine the ultimate champion. </p><p>As of now, there are no cards banned, but it wouldn't surprise me if they treat this like High Voltage-style and ban cards like Galactus and Magik just to speed things along.</p><p>The tournament will start a week after the last of the Fantastic Four: First Steps cards drop, giving players some time to decide if their already perfect deck could be better.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">For years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players have been wondering when the game would take them to a location teased way back before the original Destiny was even released: Old Chicago. With the release of its latest expansion, Edge of Fate, it looks like we might have at least a vague answer: soon.</p><p dir="ltr">Echoes of Fate seems subtle on this point, at first. Though the story is set on Kepler, a new location flung way out toward the edge of the solar system, it deals a lot with time-bending looks back into the past, and a few hints toward the future. You get your first hint about Chicago when Lodi, the expansion's new character, gets a glimpse of the future. He mentions standing with the Guardian, Destiny's player character, on the shores of Lake Michigan--the Great Lake on whose shores Chicago is found.</p><p dir="ltr">And then there's the train. The campaign's opening cutscene sees series mainstay Ikora Rey nearly getting run over by a subway train seemingly zapped across time to appear in Destiny 2's far-flung futuristic post-apocalypse. Trains are all over the expansion, acting as a story touchstone, a sort of reality-bending entry point for different areas in the new location of Kepler, and the expansion's defining image.</p><p dir="ltr">That train car sure looks like Chicago's "El" train, the elevated railway that runs throughout the city, once you're primed to look for it. And if you zoom in on the Edge of Fate key art, you can see the train's destination printed above the door. It says "Ravenswood," a north Chicago neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535477"></a><figcaption>See that train car in the middle of the image?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535477-edgeoffate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But any sleuthing becomes unnecessary when things get really explicit later on, as you near the end of the campaign. In one of the final missions, Destiny 2 mainstay Ikora Rey literally says something to the effect of, "Maybe soon we'll go to Chicago."</p><p dir="ltr">Old Chicago is a big deal to Destiny players who have been around for a while. The location has been wondered about, discussed, and even teased for years. Bungie first dropped the possibility of visiting Old Chicago back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/17/bungies-destiny-a-land-of-hope-and-dreams" rel="nofollow ">before the original Destiny was even released</a>. Since then, references to the city have come up time and again in lore and story. When Bungie first showed off images of its 2022 expansion, The Witch Queen, players speculated the location in its first trailer might be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22518875/destiny-2-witch-queen-expansion-old-chicago-screenshot-tease" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the swampy outskirts of Chicago</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It'd be a significant location to visit, because while Destiny 2 has destinations set on Earth, they're fairly nondescript. The European Dead Zone, or EDZ, takes players to a destroyed, fictional European town called Trostland. There's also the Cosmodrome, an airplane and spaceship graveyard and control facility located somewhere in Russia. But both locations are invented for Destiny 2--they don't really reference anywhere specific from our world.</p><p dir="ltr">Chicago, on the other hand, <em>would</em> be a recognizable place from our reality, and it would be the first. While the old cities of Earth are all destroyed hundreds of years before the events of Destiny 2, surely the city will still <em>look</em> like the Chicago we expect, and seeing it in its ravaged, post-alien invasion state would be interesting in and of itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535476"></a><figcaption>A cutscene during Edge of Fate's campaign shows a distant city that's also the location of the Department of External Observation. Based on the landscape and the highway sign, it could be Chicago.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4535476-destinychicago.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It'd also be the first American location to get Destiny 2's futuristic treatment, so we'd get to see how Bungie might play with the city and change it through the course of both hundreds of years of progress and hundreds of years of decay. That's to say nothing of what gameplay opportunities the ravaged city might afford, or story implications of the possibility of any humans still eeking out a living there.</p><p dir="ltr">There are hints within the Edge of Fate campaign that Chicago could be an important location as Destiny 2's story develops, too. Cutscenes in the expansion jump back in time to Earth in what appears to be the 1960s, and one includes a distant city skyline. That city is also the apparent location of the Department of External Observation, a government agency from the past focused on the possibility of alien contact and abduction, which plays a significant role in the expansion. So if Chicago is, in fact, a future destination, it seems very likely the DEO is too.</p><p dir="ltr">That's a lot of speculation, but it really seems like Edge of Fate is setting up Chicago as its next big destination. If that's the case, it'll be the culmination of waiting and speculation that's lasted all of Destiny's life--almost 12 years.</p>

                <p>After a three-year silence, a developer behind the ambitious Fallout: Bakersfield has revealed a new trailer for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-1993/" data-ref-id="5000-815">Doom</a> total conversion mod that transforms id's shooter into the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a>, and it almost looks too good to be true.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Alexander "Red888guns" Berezin is one of the leading developers behind the project. The mod looks to recreate Fallout 1's Ghoul city of Necropolis as a FPS campaign using GZDoom, a modified version of Doom that supports modern features like dynamic lighting, high resolution textures, better rendering, and more not possible in id's original game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e8WrmOibpM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6e8WrmOibpM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It's immediately clear that Berezin knows the look and feel of the first two Fallout games inside and out, as the new four-minute Fallout: Bakersfield trailer perfectly captures not only the visual style and aesthetic but also the tone of original Fallout games.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the trailer shows how Berezin has blended the iconography of Doom and Fallout seamlessly together, with a UI that is immediately reminiscent of Doom (complete with a guy's face in a little box in the middle of the screen) but brilliantly melded with the Pip-Boy aesthetics of Fallout. There's even a neon green text box in the left corner of the screen that displays environmental information and damage dealt, just like in the original Fallout.</p><p dir="ltr">The mod is a non-commercial project and will be playable for free, though it might still be a while before players can get their hands on it. The end of the trailer reveals various stats about the project and estimates it to be around 60% complete. A release date shown in the trailer flickers with various question marks that slowly transform into a year. While at first it looks like the year "2027" will be displayed, it quickly swaps back to a question mark, perhaps implying that Fallout: Bakersfield's release date is still in flux.</p><p dir="ltr">While the wait for Fallout: Bakersfield might be a long one, the wait for official new Fallout games may be longer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-now-reportedly-fully-greenlit/1100-6533153/" data-ref-id="1100-6533153">Fallout 5 was reported to have been recently greenlit</a> but is likely still many years away. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-will-have-more-content-based-on-the-tv-show/1100-6533192/" data-ref-id="1100-6533192">Fallout 76 will continue to receive new content</a> based on Amazon's popular Fallout TV show, which recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">wrapped production on season 2</a>.</p>

                <p>2023's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is still getting new updates, and the next one is a big one.

The update releases on December 5, which is just ahead of the release of the next movie, Avatar: Fire and Ash, on December 19.</p><p>The third-person mode allows players to see the world of Pandora from a new perspective.

The update has been released and it includes an improved photo mode as well as the ability to use Delemain's taxi service, autodrive options, and new vehicles. </p><p>Earlier this summer, CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-a-launch-title/1100-6530557/" data-ref-id="1100-6530557">ported Cyberpunk 2077 to Nintendo Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-is-coming-to-another-new-platform-this-week/1100-6533172/" data-ref-id="1100-6533172">to Mac</a>.

                <p>You'll be able to earn a free skin, a Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car body, and a Red Hot Chili Peppers jam track when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rocket-league/" data-ref-id="5000-397027">Rocket League</a> kick off their second annual Summer Road Trip event on Tuesday, July 22. Players can earn the Corvette and its matching set of wheels by playing either Fortnite or Rocket League--but you'll have to play both games if you want to get all the free rewards. The Summer Road Trip event ends on August 4 in Rocket League, and August 7 in Fortnite.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535416" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535416"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to earn the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 for free during the Summer Road Trip event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4535416-fortnitechevycorvette.jpg"></figure><p>On the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-party-up-summer-road-trip-unlock-the-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-bundle?lang=en-US" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite side</a>, players will be given a new quest each day to gain XP while in a party in certain modes--with the quests alternating each day between Epic-created modes like Battle Royale and Reload, and user-created games. Each completed quest unlocks a new reward, starting with "The Zephyr Song" by The Red Hot Chili Peppers for completing one quest, and ending with the Chevrolet Corvette ZR1 car body for completing eight of them. Most of the rewards in between are filler items like sprays and emoticons, but there's also a high-quality wrap and a rubber ducky pickaxe.</p><p><a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/step-into-the-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-car-body-in-rocket-leagues-summer-road-trip" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In Rocket League</a>, the event is split in half, with most of the quests and rewards available on the first day of the event, with the final quest to unlock the Corvette becoming available on July 28. But that first batch of quests also includes some rewards for Fortnite. Making 15 saves during the Summer Road Trip will unlock the Fortnite skin Hairpin, and playing a private match with mutators on will unlock a Fortnite glider that looks like a Rocket League ball. Neither of those items can be earned in Fortnite.</p><p>This year's summer road trip has slightly more rewards and significantly less controversy than last year's event, which had the maligned Tesla Cybertruck as its big prize at the end, and offered the free jam track "Holiday" by Green Day. The big new wrinkle here is having rewards for playing Rocket League that cannot be used in Rocket League--the glider and the Hairpin skin are Fortnite-specific items.</p><p>All but one of the rewards from this year's Summer Road Trip could end up in the item shop after the event ends, and it's likely that at least the jam track and the car will get that treatment sooner than later--the Cybertruck hit the item shop immediately after the event closed last August, for example. The only definitely exclusive item is the ZR1 Circuit decal for the Corvette.</p><p>The Summer Road Trip isn't the only big cosmetic news for Fortnite this week. Friday will also bring the Fantastic Four to the item shop, both in the form of skins, and as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fantastic-four-nikes-are-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6533214/" data-ref-id="1100-6533214">shoes</a>.</p>
