Of course, cheating happens in most popular multiplayer games, and with the surface area of Call of Duty being so large, cheaters were always going to find a way to do what they do.</p><p>Now, <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/article/1974942752485077132" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision has shared some data points</a> about cheating in the beta so far, led by the statistic that 97% of cheaters were stopped within 30 minutes of when they signed in for the early-access beta. Further, fewer than 1% of people who attempted to cheat actually got into a match. Those who did were booted "within minutes."</p>

<p>"Cheaters were expected. But our upgraded systems caught them faster than ever, powered by strengthened TPM 2.0 checks and automated systems helping to eliminate a large number of attempts to cheat," Activision's anti-cheat team, Ricochet, said. "Those who did manage to slip through didn't last long. Most never made it into a match."</p><p>People may have seen clips online of people cheating in the Black Ops 7 beta, and that maybe made you think the beta was overrun with cheaters. However, Activision said, "We had already actioned on most of those accounts before they hit social media."</p><p>"We're watching closely, acting in real time, and learning from every attempt. And this is just the beginning. When launch arrives, every layer of protection will be in full force, and Ricochet anti-cheat's defenses will only grow stronger," the developer said.</p><p>Activision added that its anti-cheat efforts have included disabling the cheats provided by cheat-makers and shutting down their businesses altogether. "We have now directly contributed to the closure of over 40 cheat developers and resellers since Black Ops 6 launched. Vendors sharing clips during beta were already on our radar and we will pursue them beyond in-game enforcement," Activision said.</p><p>Also in its post, Activision admitted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-enable-tpm-2-0-so-that-your-pc-is-ready-for-windows-11/1100-6496686/" data-ref-id="1100-6496686">TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot requirements for Black Ops 7's beta</a> can feel "disruptive," but it's necessary to "help ensure a secure, fair experience for every player, and we appreciate your patience and cooperation as we strengthen PC protections."</p><p>The Black Ops 7 beta is now free and open to everyone following the early-access period. Additionally, Activision has added something fans had been asking for: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-adds-non-sbmm-playlist-opens-for-everyone/1100-6535236/" data-ref-id="1100-6535236">a non-SBMM playlist.</a></p><p>For more, check out these stories:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-guns/2900-7063/" data-ref-id="2900-7063">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Guns, Weapons, And Perks Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-maps/2900-7062/" data-ref-id="2900-7062">All Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 Maps Available At Launch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-all-modes/2900-7059/" data-ref-id="2900-7059">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7 - All The Multiplayer Modes For Beta And Launch</a></li></ul>

One person on Reddit posted a photo of the game's Phantom Edition for PS5. It sports the PEGI logo, which means the copy of game likely came from a European retailer, but it's not clear which one.</p><p>Many theorized that, although this person obtained a copy of the game early, they might not be able to play until the servers officially go live. However, the person said the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1nzhg5l/comment/ni2iofv/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">servers are online already and the campaign is playable as well.</a> Officially, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">EA says Battlefield 6 servers go live on October 10. </a></p><p>Others have apparently <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1975197858497454532" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained a physical copy of Battlefield 6 already as well</a>. Given this, people who care about spoilers for the campaign may want to be extra mindful for the next few days until launch.</p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC; it's not coming to last-gen platforms and there is no early access like there was for Battlefield 2042.</p><p>The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-not-on-game-pass-but-is-coming-to-a-subscription-service/1100-6533658/" data-ref-id="1100-6533658">not coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>, but EA Play Pro subscribers can get Battlefield 6's Phantom Edition ($100 USD) as part of the subscription, which costs $17/month.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first entry in the series since 2021's Battlefield 2042, a game that was a disappointment for many fans. Early signs look more positive for Battlefield 6, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">experts do not believe the game has enough juice to beat Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year.</a> In any event, EA is having some playful fun with the competition, recently releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-live-action-trailer-pokes-fun-at-call-of-duty/1100-6535075/" data-ref-id="1100-6535075">live-action trailer for Battlefield 6</a> that roasts Call of Duty.</p><p>In other news, Battlefield owner EA is in the process of being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">acquired by an investor consortium</a> led by Saudi Arabia and Donald Trump's son-in-law.</p>

                <p>Recently, a rumor swirled online that Microsoft was canceling its next-generation Xbox plans, but that is apparently not true or the full story. Microsoft said in a statement that it is "actively investing" in future first-party consoles and devices that are "designed, engineered, and built by Xbox."</p><p>The statement, shared with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, pointed fans to the announcement from June this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">Microsoft is working with AMD on future consoles and devices. </a></p><p>At the time, Xbox president Sarah Bond said Microsoft and AMD will work together to "co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices, including our next-generation Xbox consoles. In your living room and in your hands."</p><p>In February 2024, Bond said the next Xbox would offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><h2><strong>What did the original source say?</strong></h2><p>The rumors that Microsoft had canceled future Xbox hardware plans stemmed from <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/page-29#post-270866538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum member SneakersSO</a>, who said plans for future Xbox hardware had morphed from "really concrete" to "up in the air." The internet did what the internet does and extrapolated from this that plans for future Xbox devices made by Microsoft had been canceled, even though the source did not say that.</p><p>The person added that Microsoft's future may be more focused on games, and specifically its biggest franchises, including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft, Candy Crush, and Forza Horizon and away from dedicated hardware. To that end, the report said Microsoft will look to further push Xbox Cloud Gaming on more devices to help drive Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren, a person known for breaking stories about Xbox, said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ny8bms/tom_warren_sneakersso_knows_a_lot_of_what_goes_on/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person is known to have reliable sources and good information</a>. This is presumably part of the reason why the "Xbox is dead" story spread so fast and wide over the weekend prior to Microsoft issuing its statement.</p><h2><strong>Xbox's struggles</strong></h2><p>It's no secret that the Xbox platform is lagging behind PlayStation this console generation, with monthly US sales reports from Circana showing Xbox regularly ranking third against PlayStation and Nintendo. Microsoft itself has told fans they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">do not need an Xbox to play Xbox games</a>. Thanks to Game Pass and the cloud, the devices people may already own--including a smartphone or tablet--can play Xbox games via Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft is reminding people of this with its "This is an Xbox" campaign.</p><p>Xbox has also faced public perception challenges of late thanks to the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">mass layoffs, game cancellations, and studio closures</a>. Most recently, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised Xbox Game Pass Ultimate's price by 50%, up to $30/month</a>, with many saying Microsoft is a greedy company looking to squeeze players even more.</p>
