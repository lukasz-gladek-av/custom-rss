                <p>Nintendo Switch 2 ended its debut summer with record-breaking sales numbers, according to data from research firm Circana.</p><p>Sharing the firm's monthly sales report for August on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m2op7dqxt226" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky</a>, Circana executive director Mat Piscatella stated that 2.4 million Switch 2 units were sold in the US during its first three months on the market, surpassing the record set by the PlayStation 4, which had sold 2.2 million units in its first three months. That makes Switch 2 the fastest-selling home console in the US through this timeframe.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m2op7dqxt226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidkuv7smumtaswzqyh3q2gypza4667mg2ayayu2jcm5ef2lazidyu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><p>Hardware - With 2.4M units sold LTD over its first 3 months market, Nintendo Switch 2 is now 5% ahead of the previous record setting pace of PlayStation 4, which sold 2.2M units during the 3 months ending January 2014.</p>  — Mat Piscatella (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@matpiscatella.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m2op7dqxt226?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">October 8, 2025 at 9:02 AM</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Piscatella added that Switch 2 sales are pacing 77% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch when comparing their respective first three months on sale. Circana also credited Switch 2 for driving an 11% increase in spending growth in August 2025 compared to the same month in the previous year.</p><p>Looking at hardware alone, monthly spending on consoles rose to $312 million--a 32% increase--compared to a year ago. In fact, Piscatella said that the success of the Switch 2 actually "offset double-digit percentage declines" for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and even the original Switch; all three of those platforms received at least one price hike this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">most recently the Xbox Series consoles.</a></p><p>That's all to say that Switch 2 is thriving in its early months, giving the industry as a whole a much-needed boost in momentum.</p><p>The hybrid console already claimed the title of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">fastest-selling home console in the world</a> less than a week after its launch, and it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-helps-shatter-a-us-hardware-june-sales-record-that-stood-for-17-years-circana/1100-6533373/" data-ref-id="1100-6533373">breaking records left and right</a>. At the beginning of August, Nintendo said that it sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">6 million Switch 2 units globally</a>, expecting to sell 15 million consoles by March 2026.</p>

                <p>Fans of the Dead Space series have expressed strong dissatisfaction over the pricing of a new crossover bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-new-skate-game-in-15-years-is-out-now-and-its-free/1100-6534774/" data-ref-id="1100-6534774">EA's free-to-play title, Skate, currently in early access</a>. The bundle features a cardboard-style Isaac Clarke costume, a themed skateboard, the Necro Stomp emote, and several stickers. The bundle is priced at 3,350 San Van Bucks, the game's virtual currency, but the pricing structure forces players to spend a minimum of $35 to acquire the necessary in-game funds. While a USG Ishimura T-shirt is available for free, the cost of the full bundle has drawn criticism for being excessive.</p><p>While this isn't the first collab between Dead Space and Skate, as there was a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-3/cheats/">Isaac Clarke skin in Skate 3</a>, the new bundle has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadSpace/comments/1o0usq9/the_state_of_dead_space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">continued the debate over microtransaction practices</a>. Some players drew comparisons between the original Skate 3 unlockable and this new version, pointing out that when the costume was free, it felt more like a fun Easter egg than a monetized item. However, others have suggested the new costume's exaggerated cardboard look may be intentional, aiming for a Halloween costume aesthetic rather than a direct replica of Isaac Clarke's iconic armor. Even so, the $35 price tag remains a sore point. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/BlackoutTV_/status/1975646767518536028" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>On the left is Isaac Clarke from Dead Space in Skate 3. Model looks incredible &amp; could only be obtained through a cheat code.</p><p>On the right is an Issac Clarke outfit in a bundle (pic included of bundle) on Skate 4. It costs roughly $30-$40 and looks horrible.</p><p>Idek what to say… <a href="https://t.co/G4dd9Y76jr" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/G4dd9Y76jr</a></p></div>  — SirBlackout (@BlackoutTV_) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackoutTV_/status/1975646767518536028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>However, not all community feedback has been negative. One Reddit user offered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1o19akx/skate_is_charging_40_for_a_terrible_dead_space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a more nuanced view</a> of the game's direction: "On the one hand, I do get it. I would definitely have preferred this game to be a traditional, single-player Skate game where everything is included in the purchase price. On the other hand, I've been playing and loving the new Skate. You do get tons of cosmetics for free if the virtual dress-up part of the game is your bag. The biggest downside is that you only get a handful of items for free that are from real skating brands."</p><p>The user went on to say they paid $25 for the Supporter Pack and felt the overall value was strong, citing access to branded items and a surprisingly generous season pass system. "A traditional Skate was never going to happen these days, so if it took being F2P to get made, I'd rather have this than nothing, as there is a lack of good skating games these days."</p><p>Reactions online have reflected a mix of disappointment and cynicism. "Let's hope that one day Dead Space will reach a state as an IP that it isn’t solely relegated to just being a skin in a mediocre always-online game to boost microtransactions," another Redditor wrote.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Another fan on Twitter</a> commented, "You can buy three Dead Space games with that money (and probably three Skate games)." While some appreciate the ongoing crossover between two beloved EA properties, many argue that the current execution--and its pricing--detract from what could have been a celebratory moment for both franchises.</p><p>Still, the pricing has stirred frustration among Dead Space fans in particular, many of whom are disheartened by the franchise's uncertain future. Despite the critical success of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/" data-ref-id="1900-6418021">2023 Dead Space remake,</a> EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-no-longer-working-on-dead-space-2-remake-insider-claims/1100-6522552/" data-ref-id="1100-6522552">reportedly shelved plans for a Dead Space 2 remake</a> and a potential Dead Space 4, reassigning <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-iron-man-developer-now-working-on-battlefield-too/1100-6522500/" data-ref-id="1100-6522500">developer Motive to the Battlefield franchise</a>.
