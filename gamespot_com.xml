The studio wouldn't clarify what the "last-minute certification issue" was, but the team is willing to "work over the weekend" if necessary to get this update optimized for deployment.</p>

<p>"We want to share an update on our most recent patch. It was originally planned for Tuesday, but a last-minute certification issue caused a delay," the developer said. "The team is now targeting delivery by the end of this week, with staff ready to work over the weekend if needed. There's still a small chance the issue won't be fully resolved by Friday, which could push the patch to next week. We're doing everything we can to deliver it this week and will provide an update on Friday either way. Thanks for your patience and understanding."</p><p>It's unclear if the delayed patch is the same one Arrowhead Game Studios has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-planned-for-october-with-bigger-performance-pieces-needing-more-time/1100-6534979/" data-ref-id="1100-6534979">planned to arrive in "mid-October-ish"</a> that'll fix the game's performance bugs. However, based on what we know about that update and what the studio has said about this delayed patch, it's safe to assume that they're connected, if not one in the same. After all, the delayed patch, according to Arrowhead Game Studios, will "focus on fixing performance, bugs, and balance," which is what the planned "mid-October-ish" update will do--and more.</p><p>"As we previously shared, we have pushed back our content releases, including Warbonds, to focus on fixing performance, bugs, and balance," the studio said. "The upcoming patch includes many bug fixes, performance optimizations, and a weapons/enemy balance pass--not included in the list below. We want to share a smaller list of optimizations with you ahead of time so that you can get a better idea of what's coming, and then the full patch notes will go live with the patch as usual."</p><p>This update isn't out yet, so we don't have the full patch notes right now. That said, Arrowhead Game Studios did provide a brief overview of the optimizations you can expect to see when the delayed patch finally drops.</p><h3><b>Optimizations For The Upcoming Release:</b></h3><ul><li>Optimized status effects</li><li>Optimized physics by only enabling powered ragdolls when needed</li><li>Optimized physics body handling for damage calculations</li><li>Optimized Automaton units and NPC eyes, by changing them from particle effects to shaders</li><li>Optimized AI behaviors by analyzing and stripping out redundant code</li><li>Reduced stuttering during drop-in sequence for missions on Hive Worlds</li><li>Improved audio IO performance</li><li>Snow distribution and overall look has been reworked</li><li>Improved performance by tweaking LOD settings for characters</li><li>Optimized asset distribution for several planets types</li><li>Optimized scattered assets such as grass on various planet types</li><li>Optimized asset distribution in Hiveworlds and Terminid caves</li><li>Optimized asset setup and geometry for assets used in Hiveworlds and Terminid caves</li><li>Optimized status effect physics and particle systems while maintaining visual feedback and fidelity</li><li>Optimized various Automaton explosion VFX</li><li>Optimized Acid Rain effects during Acid Storms</li><li>Optimized Dragonroach fire attack VFX</li><li>Made various optimizations to the fire system, including particle and light optimization.</li><li>Improved performance by optimizing the rendering of several shaders</li></ul>

According to Circana, Borderlands 4 didn't just set a franchise record in September, it also became the third highest-selling video game in the US for 2025.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella‬ shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvn3gwbk25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the sales charts for September 2025</a> in the US, and Borderlands 4 topped the Xbox Series X|S and PC charts, while coming in at No. 3 on PlayStation's list. Specific sales numbers weren't included in the charts, but Piscatella noted that Borderlands 4 "generated the highest launch month dollar sales of any title in franchise history, nearly 30% higher than the previous best, Borderlands 3."</p><p>However, it remains to be seen if that momentum was retained in October. PC players have been very vocal about the game's optimization issues. Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenged players' negative reviews</a> on social media and even suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">they should get a refund</a>. Pitchford went on to offer optimization tips, while Gearbox has put forth <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-stuttering-on-pc-gearbox-has-an-unusual-step-to-fix-stability-issues/1100-6535046/" data-ref-id="1100-6535046">an unusual step</a> to handle recurring problems on the game's PC port. The company subsequently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-patch-notes-add-fov-slider-on-console-stability-and-performance-improvements-and-more/1100-6535022/" data-ref-id="1100-6535022">new Borderlands 4 patch</a> to tackle some of the game's stability and performance issues.</p><p>Pitchford recently noted that the Borderlands franchise is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-says-we-suck-and-heres-why/1100-6535409/" data-ref-id="1100-6535409">closing in on the 100 million sales milestone</a> across all titles. Borderlands 4 reportedly only needs to sell 6 million copies to reach that franchise mark.</p><p>Meanwhile, Gearbox has set November 20 as the release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">Borderlands 4's first DLC</a>. For now, Borderlands 4's Switch 2 port has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">been delayed indefinitely</a>.</p>

                <p>While Pikmin fans might not be getting a new game anytime soon, an upcoming update should give them some reasons to jump back into Pikmin 4.</p><p>Coming on an unspecified date this November, the update will add some attractive features to Pikmin 4, most notably a camera mode and difficulty modes that will make the Nintendo Switch game easier or harder.</p><p>With the new Field Camera tool, players can snap in-game photos and fully customize them with stamps, frames, and filters. Pikmin 3 featured a camera tool, but the field camera in Pikmin 4 looks more in line with camera modes in most modern games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBtBDFzu9ZA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TBtBDFzu9ZA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are also new "Creature Difficulty Levels," which is just Nintendo's fancy phrasing for difficulty modes. The easier Relaxed mode will make it so enemies won't attack unless they're attacked first, and they'll also be less difficult to defeat. On the other hand, Fierce mode will increase the difficulty, which is a great option for veteran Pikmin players seeking a greater challenge.</p><p>But the cutest addition to Pikmin 4 is the inclusion of Decor Pikmin from Niantic's mobile game Pikmin Bloom. Players can find Pikmin donning some form of decoration, like a ladybug toy costume, a pink doughnut, or an ice cream hat. No, they don't have any special abilities, but they're adorable as hell. These little guys can also be transferred to Pikmin Bloom.</p><p>A free demo is available for Pikmin 4, and it will be updated the same day as the full game. Unfortunately for Switch 2 owners, Nintendo makes no mention of any technical enhancements for Pikmin 4 on the new console, hindering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-we-want-to-see/2900-6488/#7" data-ref-id="2900-6488">hopes of a Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p><p>The announcement for the future update comes on the heels of the bizarre drop of an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-second-weird-baby-short-introduces-pikmin-to-the-mix/1100-6535303/" data-ref-id="1100-6535303">animated Pikmin short film</a> called "Close to you." The video by Nintendo Pictures was initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-put-out-a-weird-animated-short-film-with-no-explanation/1100-6535274/" data-ref-id="1100-6535274">released in a cryptic manner</a> without any explicit Pikmin connection. Another version of the short came out not long after, adding Pikmin to the mix.</p><p>The video led to intense speculation about a new Pikmin game or a feature film, but it appeared to be just a separate project by Nintendo Pictures. In addition to announcing the Pikmin 4 update, Nintendo also released the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75JEwjP_GD8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full "Close to you" video</a>, featuring both versions of the short, on YouTube.</p>
