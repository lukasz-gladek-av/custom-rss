                <p>The Xbox Series S has faced its share of criticism, but Microsoft isn't pivoting away from the console. In fact, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes the Series S is part of what helps differentiate Microsoft in the market. The apparent clause at Microsoft that mandates developers support both Series X and Series S for games coming to the platform is not going to change, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/savestateplus/home?newFreeMembership=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer said Microsoft has a "real advantage" right now thanks to the Series S because some of the most popular new platforms, including Steam Deck and ROG Ally, are more in line with the power and performance specs of the Series S.</p><p>"When we look at something like a Steam Deck or a ROG Ally, we've got this Xbox Series S version of the game that's more tailored to the device specs of a lot of devices that are getting introduced right now. I think that helps us," he said, going on to specifically mention the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KK8xil5Uy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-KK8xil5Uy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For what it's worth, Spencer separately told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerTag Radio</a> that he's been in contact with Nintendo's president and plans to put Xbox games on Switch 2.</p><p>Asked directly if Microsoft could remove or amend the apparent "parity clause" between Xbox Series X and S, Spencer said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-spencer-says-series-s-compatibility-requirement-isnt-going-anywhere/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), "In a way, I think about it almost exactly the opposite way right now."</p><p>There has been ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the challenges that getting games to run on the lower-powered system present.</p><p>In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox.</a> Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a> Concerns exist about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> might run on the Series S, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">Take-Two isn't worried</a>. More recently, the developers of Black Myth: Wukong said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">Xbox port delay is due to the Series S.</a></p><p>In regards to sales volume, the Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Spencer said in the interview that he believes the Series S is an important part of Microsoft's hardware offerings, saying it's no slouch and can handle new games capably.</p><p>"The scalability of engines today allows [games] to scale from ray trace-enabled, multi-thousand dollar graphics on desktop PCs all the way through to a handheld, battery-powered device. So for me, Xbox Series S has been helpful in our portfolio," he said. "I'm playing Indiana Jones on the S and it looks great. It's definitely capable of playing current-generation games in a great way."</p><p>The Xbox Series S has been important for Microsoft and will continue to be an "important design point" for Microsoft's teams going forward, Spencer said.</p><p>Also during his chat, Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">discussed the possibility of Starfield coming to PS5</a>, while in a separate interview he talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028">Microsoft's desire to "win" in the hardware market.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Larian Studios announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> will be receiving one last major update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6528863/" data-ref-id="1100-6528863">Patch 8</a>. And while select Baldur's Gate 3 players will be invited to a stress test for Patch 8, the update has been mistakenly released for some PlayStation 5 players ahead of the scheduled time. Larian confirmed the mistake in a post on social media.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn’t yet begun.<br>Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8.<br>While we work with our partners to understand what’s going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7.<br>How’s your Monday going?</p>  — Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Larian subsequently shared <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a longer update about the situation</a>, which acknowledged that Patch 8 was mistakenly available for a few hours to PlayStation 5 players in Europe and Asia. The studio also warned that Patch 8 is not compatible with Patch 7, and urged players to uninstall and reinstall the game to return to the previous patch. Players who don't revert to Patch 7 may risk losing their saves.</p><p>Additionally, Larian indicated that receiving the Patch 8 by itself was not intended as an invitation to the stress test. Players who were selected to take part in that should receive a separate email--if they haven't gotten one already--and the Patch 8 stress test will go on as scheduled later this week.</p><p>Patch 8 will introduce cross-play between all consoles, PC, as well as a Photo Mode, in-game bug fixes, and mod improvements. Larian is currently developing a new project, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.

                <p>Nvidia remains one of the world's largest companies by market cap, but the chip-maker is having a tough day on the stock market today. The company's share price slid by nearly 17% today, wiping out more than $500 billion in market cap. Should this hold through the end of the trading day, it would be far and away the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/27/biggest-market-loss-in-history-nvidia-stock-plunges-15-as-deepseek-shakes-ai-darling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">biggest single-day trading loss for a company in history</a>. Nvidia's previous $279 billion one-day dip is the existing record-holder.</p><p>Why is Nvidia stock tanking? The stock price had been surging for the past two years as investors felt bullish on the company's fortunes due to excitement in the market about artificial intelligence. Nvidia sells the necessary GPUs to train large-language models and for general AI use, after all.</p><p>But at the end of last week, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek launched a new model, R1, that the company claims is far cheaper than other models out there, including Open AI's o1. The fear from investors, it seems, is that AI companies may not actually require as much computing power as it was once believed. This, in turn, could have spooked investors and sent Nvidia's stock price down.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's rivals in the AI space, including Arm and Broadcom, also saw their share prices slump on Monday. Stock prices regularly move, sometimes dramatically so, in response to relevant market announcements.</p><p>DeepSeek is not new, but instead was founded after a spin-out from hedge fund High-Flyer in 2023. <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own paper</a> said its R1 model was trained for a cost of about $5.6 million, which is just a small percentage of what OpenAI and others are said to have spent on their systems. Because DeepSeek's systems have made strides in <em>software</em>, they could be less reliant on <em>hardware</em> like the GPUs that Nvidia sells, and some experts believe DeepSeek might signal a sea-change in the AI landscape.</p><p>The emergence of DeepSeek's new model comes not long after President Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure program, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stargate</a>, led by investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. At least some of that appears to consist of existing investments that were previously announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/27/chinas-deepseek-ai-model-shocks-world-sell-nvidia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As Motley Fool points out</a>, there are some that believe DeepSeek is not being totally honest in explaining the true costs of its systems. AI researcher Nathan Lampert estimates DeepSeek's true training costs as being as high as $1 billion. Other AI experts, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, believe DeepSeek and others actually have more Nvidia chips than they may be allowed to disclose given export rules.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From last week: Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang says that DeepSeek and other Chinese AI labs have more Nvidia chips than they can talk about because of current US export controls <a href="https://t.co/tPzmdEvvik" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tPzmdEvvik</a></p>  — Morning Brew ☕️ (@MorningBrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The launch of DeepSeek hasn't gone totally smoothly for the company. <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own website</a> states that it's facing "large-scale malicious attacks" on its services just days after releasing.</p><p>Nvidia is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 company worldwide based on market cap</a>, only trailing behind Apple and Microsoft.
