                <p>Amazing Seasun has confirmed that an open beta for its multiplayer mecha shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a> will begin on February 23. It will be the most comprehensive one for the game yet, featuring most of what players can expect in Mecha Break at release.</p><p>The Global Storm Open Beta begins at 2 AM PT / 5 AM PT on February 23, while no end date has been confirmed yet. Global Storm will contain the 6v6 Operation Verge and 3v3 Ace Arena modes that have been in previous Mecha Break betas, but it will be the first to feature full cross-play across PC and console and include Mashmak. Mashmak is Mecha Break's PvPvE extraction mode, where teams of players work together or fight each other over an element called Corite.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UbY_bPQ-9I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-UbY_bPQ-9I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mashmak gets its name from the map on which this mode takes place. An evil organization called Theia's Vanguard has taken over the Mashmak Isles and its massive supply of Corite. That serves as the narrative backdrop for why players explore, collect resources, and fight each other before extracting. From a gameplay perspective, Mashmak stands out because players can equip themselves with special mode-exclusive equipment to enhance their suits' abilities.</p><p>Mecha Break will launch for PC and Xbox Series X|S sometime in Spring 2025 before coming to other platforms later in the year. The PC version of this open beta can be pre-loaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a> from 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET on February 20.</p>
