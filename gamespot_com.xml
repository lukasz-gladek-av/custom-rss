                <p>Following the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-has-been-delayed/1100-6537161/" data-ref-id="1100-6537161">delay to May 2026</a>, IO Interactive has announced the PC requirements for the upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light.</p><p>IO also mentioned that it worked "in close collaboration" with Nvidia for the game. 007 First Light uses DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation, which the developer says allows for an "even deeper sense of immersion and improved performance."</p><p>The minimum specs are relatively low-end and don't call for an SSD; this is targeting 1080p/30fps. The recommended specs are also not particularly high-end, targeting 1080p/60fps. This may be lower than many PC enthusiasts may want. There is no word on what a higher-end experience could require.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_QAoEnEO0g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6_QAoEnEO0g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>IO Interactive CTO Ulas Karademir said working with Nvidia allowed the studio to "deliver a PC experience that matches the level of quality we believe the Bond franchise deserves."</p><h2><strong>007: First Light PC requirements</strong></h2><h3><strong>Minimum:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 9500K / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li><li><strong>Graphic Card:</strong> Nvidia GTX 1660 / AMD RX 5700 / Intel discrete GPU equivalent</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16 GB</li><li><strong>Video RAM:</strong> 8 GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 80 GB minimum</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11, 64-bit</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li><li><strong>Frame rate: </strong>30 FPS</li></ul><h3><strong>Recommended:</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i5 13500 / AMD Ryzen 5 7600</li><li><strong>Graphic Card:</strong> Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti / AMD RX 6700 XT / Intel discrete GPU equivalent</li><li><strong>RAM:</strong> 32 GB</li><li><strong>Video RAM:</strong> 12 GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 80 GB minimum</li><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11, 64-bit</li><li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li><li><strong>Frame rate: </strong>60 FPS</li></ul><p>007: First Light is a third-person action-adventure game that tells the story of how James Bond earned his 00 status. The story follows a 26-year-old Bond who joins MI6 to become a spy, with the game taking players around the world to fight people and drive fast cars.</p><p>In addition to PC, 007 First Light is in the works for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. It launches on May 27, 2026, which is a day after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> was going to launch before it was delayed to November 2026.</p><p>As for the movie series, a 26th James Bond movie is in the works now with Oscar-nominated filmmaker Denis Villeneuve signed on to direct and Peaky Blinders creator Stephen Knight writing the script. There is no word yet on who may play James Bond, though Callum Turner is said to be the frontrunner.</p>

                <p>A lot of interesting technology has been revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show 2026 this week, but one of the strangest might be Razer's Project Ava, an AI-powered desktop companion. Razer envisions the device as a "dynamic personality" that can interact with its owners as a 3D hologram, and it'll have several animated personalities to choose from, including one based on the prominent League of Legends esports player, Faker.</p><p>Razer claims that Ava uses human-like vision and audio-sensing for full contextual awareness, and that it can converse with people, consult on work tasks, and motivate you to engage in self-care routines. The company says it can also assist you in your work with "two-way conversation" features, and for gaming, it can fulfill multiple roles and deliver real-time hype.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QDthx_WjwE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_QDthx_WjwE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As for the other personalities, Ava's default personality is a fusion of HAL 9000 and the original Xbox boot-up screen, Kira is an anime waifu, Zane is designed to be your gaming wingman, and Sao looks like she's ready for a day at the office. Razer says these characters are rendered in real time on a 5.5-inch holographic display and feature "high-fidelity motion, eye-tracking, and facial expressions" to help them engage with users.</p><p>Project Ava currently uses xAI's controversial Grok engine, but Razer says it will be compatible with other leading AI platforms in the future. The physical design incorporates multiple technologies, such as dual Far-Field array mics, an HD camera with an ambient light sensor, and RGB lighting, since this is a Razer product.</p><p>Project Ava is designed for Windows users and requires a direct connection to a PC via a USB-C cable to ensure high-bandwidth data transfers. Razer is aiming to launch Project Ava in the second half of 2026, but pricing has not yet been revealed.</p><p>For more from CES 2026, you can also check out the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-enters-extended-reality-with-240hz-gaming-glasses/1100-6537195/">240Hz XR gaming glasses from Asus</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyperx-reveals-non-invasive-neurotech-gaming-headset-whatever-that-means/1100-6537201/">"non-invasive" brain-scanning headset concept</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-modular-xbox-pc-controller-revealed-releases-this-summer/1100-6537181/">8BitDo's high-end Ultimate 3E gaming controller</a>.</p>

                <p>CES 2026 has officially begun, and Razer is using this year's showcase to reveal a slew of AI-powered gadgets. One of the most intriguing debuts is <a href="https://www.razer.com/concepts/project-motoko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Project Motoko</a>, an AI headset powered by Snapdragon. Equipped with a pair of cameras near each earcup, it's capable of analyzing your surroundings and giving you audio feedback on what it sees.</p><p>Razer says Project Motoko can provide all sorts of feedback to users. For example, it can be used while gaming to get feedback about a boss fight, detecting what's on the screen and giving you immediate tips. It can translate street signs when traveling abroad, summarize documents, or handle tasks as simple as counting your reps at the gym. Equipped with dual far- and near-field microphones, it can both pick up your voice commands and listen to your surroundings for environmental cues, ensuring it gives you as accurate a response as possible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630479"></a><figcaption>Razer Motoko Headset</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4630479-razer_motoko_kv-2048x1152%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>Motoko is built to connect seamlessly with most AI platforms, including OpenAI, Grok, and Gemini. It can also be used for machine learning, passively gathering data to improve the technology as the device is worn.</p><p>It's worth noting, however, that this is a fully auditory system for the user. Unlike smart glasses, which sometimes offer in-lens visual feedback, Motoko looks like your standard headset. So while it has the size to pack in impressive audio and could potentially offer a longer battery life, you won't get any visual responses from the AI.</p><p>Project Motoko does not yet have a release date. Razer says this is currently a "concept," offering folks a "glimpse into the future of AI-driven wearables."

                <p>Neurable and HyperX are teaming up to develop a gaming headset designed to help you play better. How will it do this? With an "industry-first neurotechnology-powered" headset that can potentially improve focus and accuracy in competitive games. It's also designed to use "non-invasive" neurotechnology, so you don't have to worry about getting a few cybernetic upgrades to be compatible with the device.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630426"></a><figcaption>HyperX and Neurable's headset concept</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4630426-neurable-headset.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630470,1300-4630471" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630470-headset-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4630471-headset-3.jpg"></figure><p>Neurable and HyperX claim that testing with the in-development headset has resulted in faster reaction times of up to 38 milliseconds, improved accuracy by 3%, and a higher number of targets were hit during FPS training tasks when tested on esports players. The headset uses neural-sensing technology to track metrics like cognitive load and stress from a user's brainwaves.</p><p>The AI-powered earpad sensors monitor EEG signals from your head, but it's worth noting that this isn't a magic bullet that will instantly improve your performance. You'll need to use the data from your sessions and training exercises to improve your ability to focus better during games.</p><p>Don't expect the headset to be out anytime soon, as it's still in a very early stage of development.
