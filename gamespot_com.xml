                <p>The year is 2025 and the Angry Birds franchise is not only still around, but still getting new games. Developer Rovio has launched the newest Angry Birds game, Angry Birds Bounce, via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-apple-arcade-games/2900-5678/" data-ref-id="2900-5678">Apple Arcade</a>.</p><p>That's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=A+New+Angry+Birds+Game+Is+Out+Now&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-07-03+08%3A44%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-03+09%3A05%3A40&amp;fnarticle_id=6532947&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fapps.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fangry-birds-bounce%252Fid6462195757&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fa-new-angry-birds-game-is-out-now%2F1100-6532947%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the only place you can play the game</a>, so you'll need to sign up for for $7/month subscription service to try it out. Apple Arcade offers a seven-day free trial, too, while three months of Apple Arcade are included when you buy a new iPhone or iPad, so you might want to check to see if you're eligible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRQk2gyvONE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SRQk2gyvONE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In Angry Birds Bounce, the pigs have banished the birds from their islands, so the birds--Red, Chuck, and Bomb--are doing whatever they can to get them back. Players fling the birds at the pigs, but they can now bounce off the walls for a new layer of strategy. Players need to strategically assemble a group of birds and go after specific power-ups to have the best chance at success. In essence, it appears to be a block-breaker game in the mold of Arkanoid.</p><p>Apple Arcade games have no microtransactions or ads, which is a big change from most mobile titles, and this applies also to Angry Birds Bounce.</p><p>Some of the other new additions to the Apple Arcade library in July include Kingdom Rush 5: Alliance TD and Suika Game+.

                <p>One of the games that was said to have been canceled as part of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">latest wave of cuts</a> was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">a new MMO from The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online Studios</a>. More information has now come to light about this supposed project, which is reported to have been in the works under the codename "Blackbird."</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reported</a> that Blackbird was a "new, sci-fi IP" and it had been in some form of development since 2018. The report added that ZeniMax Online Studios was making a new game engine for it, which may have contributed to its lengthy development schedule.</p><p>Pre-production on Blackbird was "going well," the report said, adding that the studio was "actively ramping up" with the belief that the game could enter full production. The report went on to say higher-ups at Xbox approved the game advancing to the next stage of development, with developers on The Elder Scrolls Online and other teams shifting to the game to support this ramp up.</p><p>The entire team working on the game has been affected by the game's cancellation, the report said, adding that "several hundreds" of developers at the Maryland-based developer were let go.</p><p>Microsoft confirmed the cancellation of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, but the company has not directly said anything about the rumored new game from ZeniMax.
