                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>

                <p>Plague Inc. developer Ndemic just dropped a surprise sequel to the smash hit Plague Inc. Instead of a pessimistic pandemic simulator, the sequel is a sunny strategy game about rebuilding after the end of the world.</p><p>After Inc. is set in the aftermath of Plague Inc.'s zombie scenario. It tasks you with running human civilization in the United Kingdom after a zombie apocalypse. Unlike its predecessors, After Inc. has an optimistic hue. The aesthetic is colorful and painterly, in contrast to the harsh UI of Plague Inc. or the cold satellite-map style of Rebel Inc., a previous follow-up about combating insurgencies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4406661"></a><figcaption>A screenshot of After Inc. showing off the game's bright, lush aesthetic and friendly UI.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1690/16904437/4406661-after-inc-screenshot-1.png"></figure><p>In an interview with newsletter <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/after-inc-plague-inc-ndemic-pandemic" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, game designer James Vaughn said, â€œI've tried to make a more happy and optimistic game this time." In each session, you play as the leader of a settlement. You combat zombies, search for resources, navigate communal disputes, and research new tech. Playing through a scenario lasts around 20 minutes and will unlock meta upgrades that affect future settlements.</p><p>After Inc. costs $2, the same price as Rebel Inc. and $1 more than Plague Inc. The store page claims this is a "special sale price" to mark the game's launch. Ndemic promises "no 'consumable microtransactions,'" meaning any content you spend money on will last in the game forever. The app store page promises that it will be "updated for years to come." You can pick up After Inc. right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ndemiccreations.afterinc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a> and on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/after-inc/id1631859420?platform=iphone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">App Store</a>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3337140/After_Inc_Revival/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A PC version</a> will launch sometime next year.</p><p>Plague Inc.'s sales sky-rocketed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/plague-inc-sales-rise-after-coronavirus-outbreak-b/1100-6473051/" data-ref-id="1100-6473051">the start of the COVID-19 pandemic</a>. The developer even donated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/plague-inc-developer-donates-250000-to-fight-coron/1100-6475147/" data-ref-id="1100-6475147">$250,000 to COVID-19 research</a> and released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/plague-inc-evolveds-new-virus-curing-dlc-is-free-on-steam-until-covid-19-is-under-control/1100-6486953/" data-ref-id="1100-6486953">a free-at-launch expansion called The Cure,</a> which centered around fighting disease rather than fostering it.</p>
