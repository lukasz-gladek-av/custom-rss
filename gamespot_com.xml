                <p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163"></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home.</p><p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Sony Honda Mobility COO Izumi Kawanishi <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>. "Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p><p>Afeela 1 will be available in California first before it goes nationwide. But aside from a 2026 release window, it doesn't currently have an on-sale date.</p>

                <p>Overwatch developer Blizzard has teased that 2026 will be the year when the studio's "boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>"We're eager to take creative steps that will allow the game to lean further into storytelling and character development, and we can't wait to share these new experiences with our community," Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "There's a real sense of momentum and optimism within the development team, and we believe 2026 will be a year where our boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>Blizzard did not share any further details, but 2026 marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and the studio presumably has some anniversary plans in store for the milestone.</p><p>Also in the post, Blizzard ran through some reflections of the past year, saying 2025 "brought out the best in the Overwatch team."</p><p>"Inspired by the evolving landscape of the industry, we embraced the opportunity to take bold risks and focused on making impactful changes rather than playing it safe," the developer said. "The response from our community has been amazing, and we feel our relationship with our players is stronger than ever."</p><p>Blizzard also called out how Overwatch 2 relaunching in China was a "standout moment" for the game in 2025. "Despite the absence, the community’s passion remained strong, with fans organizing offline events, creating art, and supporting esports. This enduring passion for the Overwatch universe highlighted how the game brings people together and means so much beyond just gameplay, reinforcing our excitement for the future," the developer said.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and studio president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/" data-ref-id="1100-6537061">Johanna Faries said it will be the "biggest year yet" for the company.</a> The company is bringing back BlizzCon in September 2026 to share a number of "major" announcements.</p>

                <p>It's almost the end of 2025, and in the spirit of Spotify Wrapped, several big companies have invited subscribers to review their last year of activity. Sony got the ball rolling with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/">PlayStation Wrap-Up</a>, Steam offers a similar annual roundup, and the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1999147161989128217" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Year in Review recap</a> has been announced for early next year--but where is Xbox in the middle of all this?</p><p>While it doesn't offer an Xbox wrap-up every year, it still feels odd for Microsoft's gaming brand to skip 2025. The year has seen several high-profile releases from the company and the launch of an Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC alongside Asus, but according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is allocating its marketing budget toward celebrating several major anniversaries in 2026.</p><p>The Xbox brand celebrates its 25th anniversary next year, Blizzard has its 35th anniversary to look forward to, and Bethesda is turning 40. Those are several significant milestones in proximity to each other, and it's a safe bet that Microsoft wants to accommodate them, possibly explaining the lack of an Xbox Wrapped this year. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzcon-2026-tickets-go-on-sale-soon-heres-how-much-theyll-cost/1100-6535959/">we'll see the return of BlizzCon in September</a>, and Blizzard has teased its "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/">biggest year yet</a>" for 2026.</p><p>Outside of Microsoft, several other gaming franchises will also have plenty of reasons to celebrate. The 30th anniversary of Pokemon is next year, Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and both The Legend of Zelda and Castlevania will reach the 40th anniversary milestone in 2026.</p><p>We have contacted Xbox to find out if there are any plans for a year-in-review wrap-up, and will update this article as soon as we hear back.</p>
