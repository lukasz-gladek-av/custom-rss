                <p>Last month, Microsoft held its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct</a> of 2025 and announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> among other titles. But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/idxbox-showcase-to-kick-off-ign-fan-fest-2025?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of "the next big collaboration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a>," details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.</p><p>During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">World Of Warcraft: The War Within</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-report/1100-6523727/" data-ref-id="1100-6523727">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.</p><p>With Microsoft's push to release more games on PlayStation 5, it's possible that some cross-platform announcements will also be a part of this Xbox Direct. Microsoft recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5, and there have been rumors for months that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> may be going to Sony's console as well. Doom: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> are also headed to PS5 later this year.</p>

                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise. Given the move to Unreal is still early, a new game in the series was said to not be "imminent."</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors continue to circulate that older Halo games once exclusive to Xbox, as well as a rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-combat-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-2728">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">may release on PlayStation 5</a> in the wake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-is-optimistic-about-xbox-multiplatform-strategy/1100-6529186/" data-ref-id="1100-6529186">Microsoft's new multi-platform game release strategy</a>.

                <p>A co-founder of the Call of Duty studio Treyarch recently pleaded guilty to striking a firefighting plane with a drone during the recent LA fires. Under the plea deal, Peter T. Akemann will avoid the potential penalty of a year in prison and will instead perform 150 hours of community service, particularly in the area of Southern California's wildfire relief efforts. The deal also includes a $65,000 fine, the cost of repairing the firefighting plane in question.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/akemann-plea-agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plea agreement</a>, Akemann flew a drone over the area of the Palisades Fire while a "Super Scooper" water-dumping plane was conducting operations in the area. His drone struck the plane's wing, causing enough damage that it had to be grounded for a period of time.</p><p dir="ltr">US attorney Joseph McNally, one of the prosecutors on the case, released a statement noting that "flying drones during times of emergency poses an extreme threat to personnel trying to help people and compromises the overall ability of police and fire to conduct operations." He reiterated that those who do fly drones in those conditions will be arrested and prosecuted just like Akemann.</p><p dir="ltr">Akemann's camp released a statement stating that the co-founder is "deeply sorry" and "accepts responsibility for his grave error in judgment." After co-founding Treyarch, Akemann parted way with the company more than 20 years ago. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/604527/drone-crashed-into-la-wildfire-plane-plea-deal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge reports</a> that he recently departed his role as the president of Skydance Interactive and that his social media accounts have been scrubbed, including X and LinkedIn.  </p><p dir="ltr">Several major video game publishers have marshaled resources to help fight the LA fires, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-games-starts-in-game-event-to-raise-funds-for-la-fire-victims/1100-6528884/" data-ref-id="1100-6528884">Riot Games</a>, which implemented in-game fundraisers in League of Legends and Valorant.

                <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has been speaking his mind and sharing his opinions lately following his exit from Sony, and now he's discussed his thoughts on the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> reveal.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=ZW7DhH1Gh0st-zxp&amp;v=HtiJlzs0xRE&amp;feature=youtu.be" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax podcast</a>, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida-on-switch-2-reveal-i-was-surprised-there-werent-many-surprises/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, Yoshida said the Switch 2 reveal event was underwhelming and that the only major surprise was the event's lack of surprises.</p><p>"I was surprised there were not many surprises," Yoshida said. "The only surprise to me was the mice thing that they showed."</p><p>Yoshida is referring to the sequence in the Switch 2 announcement trailer that showed the Switch 2's new Joy-Cons sliding across a surface like a computer mouse would. Yoshida said he hopes Nintendo uses the mouse controls for "some more weird, amazing way" that people won't see coming, as opposed to the control setup being used to play a game like Call of Duty on Switch 2.</p><p>Yoshida said he hopes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo's big Nintendo Direct in April</a> will "reveal something that's still hidden to us about Switch 2." He also addressed the string of leaks that preceded Nintendo's official Switch 2 announcement, saying he felt "very sorry" for Nintendo for the "disappointing" situation. A leak can ruin a good surprise, and Yoshida said he hopes for no further Switch 2 leaks.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that Yoshida said he was a "huge Nintendo fan," but ultimately wished the Switch 2 announcement "could have been a larger reveal."</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> Yoshida left Sony on January 15, 2025 after more than 30 years with the company.</p><p>In other PlayStation news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-set-to-air-later-this-month-report/1100-6529189/" data-ref-id="1100-6529189">next State of Play event could happen very soon.</a></p>
