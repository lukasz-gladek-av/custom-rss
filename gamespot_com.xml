                <p>MindsEye, the new game from former Rockstar Games boss Leslie Benzies and his new team at Build a Rocket Boy, launched this week, but the release didn't exactly go to plan. The game encountered numerous bugs and other issues, and now the developer has responded.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement on Reddit</a>, Build a Rocket Boy thanked fans for playing the game and submitting their feedback, while acknowledging performance issues on PC and console.</p><p>"We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6," the developer said. "We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours."</p><p>This statement was posted on June 10, so more information about the new patch is expected today, June 11. You can see some of the issues players have encountered so far in the videos below.</p><p>Hitman developer IO Interactive published MindsEye, and the company's top executive <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">does not believe the claims that people were being paid to trash the game prior to launch.</a> Prior to the launch of MindsEye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">multiple senior executive quit Build a Rocket Boy. </a></p><p>In addition to MindsEye itself, the game includes a free user-generated mode on PC called Build.Mindseye that allows players to create whatever they want.</p><p>MindsEye has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3265250/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">peaked at around 3,300 concurrent players on Steam</a>, and it's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1091500/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">not inside the top 100 most-played games on Steam.</a></p><p>Benzies was formerly the president of Rockstar North, and he worked on numerous games there, including the top-selling Grand Theft Auto V. He went on sabbatical after GTA V came out and claimed that when he tried to come back, he was locked out. Benzies sued Take-Two for $150 million in unpaid royalties, and the matter was ultimately resolved with a confidential settlement.</p>

                <p>In less than a week, the new Switch 2 console has become the "fastest-selling" hardware globally for Nintendo, as the company reported 3.5 million units were sold in just four days.</p><p>"Fans around the world are showing their enthusiasm for Nintendo Switch 2 as an upgraded way to play at home and on the go,‚Äù Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser said in a press statement following the announcement of the sales milestone. "We are thankful for their response and happy to see the fun they are already having with Nintendo Switch 2 as they explore new features and games that bring friends and family together in new ways."</p><p>This makes for one of the biggest console launches in history, thanks in part to Nintendo ensuring that it had enough stock available to meet the high demand for the device. In fact, according to industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/zhugeex/status/1932624211878818015?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Daniel Ahmad</a>, the number would make the Switch 2 launch <em>the </em>biggest in home-console history. </p><p>In comparison, the Switch reached 2.74 million units sold in its first month and Sony reported that it had shipped--not sold--3.4 million PS5 consoles during the first month that it was available to purchase. It is worth noting that stock shortages were a major problem for Sony at the time. due to various issues like the global semiconductor shortage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/">Nintendo is predicting that it will sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles</a> during its current business year--ending in March 2026--and it has been reported that this figure might increase to 20 million as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reportedly-using-samsung-chips-as-nintendo-tries-to-meet-demand/1100-6531666/">Samsung is rumored to be manufacturing chips for the device</a>. Overall, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a strong start, and it'll be interesting to see if it reaches--or surpasses--the current lifetime sales total of the Switch, which stand at 152 million units sold as of February 2025.</p>

                <p>In just under two months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/" data-ref-id="1900-6418358">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has emerged as one of the most unexpected hits of 2025, with <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1927364988219383892" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 3.3 million copies</a> sold since late April. Now, developer Sandfall Interactive has shared a new patch for the game that gives players another chance to fight Simon, one of the most difficult bosses in the game.</p><p>Simon is an optional boss who can be found in The Abyss, and he has very few weaknesses. As part of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499449376025873686?curator_clanid=3693985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 1.3.0 patch</a>, players can now get a rematch with Simon after beating him the first time. Assuming they can beat him, of course. It's not an easy fight by any stretch, and this undead warrior is a challenge even for veteran players.</p><p>Sandfall notes that the current patch addresses nearly 300 bugs that were found in the game, although it only lists a handful in the notes. According to the devs, a "general polish" was added across collisions, terrain, and scripting. The cutscenes should also scale properly across non-standard resolutions after this patch.</p><p>There aren't any new features in the current update, but the developers have acknowledged multiple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-address-potential-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6531932/" data-ref-id="1100-6531932">requests for a photo mode</a>, even from other members of the team. According to Sandfall, the developers are "investigating mouse sensitivity issues" after this patch. Sandfall has also added a handful of digital items to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/points/shop/app/1903340" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clair Obscur's Steam points shop</a>.</p><p>Sandfall is already preparing to start working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unsurprisingly-another-game-from-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-is-coming/1100-6531816/" data-ref-id="1100-6531816">on its next game</a>, but the team will also continue to tweak Clair Obscur to solve any lingering issues.

The changes detailed include "another set of changes to further improve the game server and client stability," and "more localization."

<p>Dune: Awakening has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">big numbers</a> on Steam so far--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-lot-of-people-are-playing-dune-awakening-despite-being-in-premium-early-access/1100-6532178/" data-ref-id="1100-6532178">even in its paid early-access</a> period. At the time of writing, now that the game is officially released for all players, Awakening is the 10th-most-played game on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a>, with a 24-hour peak of 142,000 players. The game also has very positive reviews on Steam, though even the positive reviews note a bit of wonkiness with the game's current state, especially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">when it comes to performance</a>.</p><p>Without the extensive early-access period <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-isnt-early-access-but-will-let-you-pay-to-play-early/1100-6530320/" data-ref-id="1100-6530320">often used</a> for this kind of online survival-crafting game, Funcom has been using the paid earl- access period to rapidly patch issues as they arise--including <a href="https://x.com/DuneAwakening/status/1931366318730625479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">adding new servers</a> as they become necessary.</p><p>The 1.1.0.11 patch notes can be found in full below, but it seems likely Funcom will continue to regularly patch the game as issues arise in its early lifespan.

                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>, Microsoft opened the final day with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> that threw the spotlight on titles coming to Xbox Series X|S either this year or next. Following the presentation, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer briefly addressed the challenges of "running a good business" while remaining accountable to Microsoft's expectations for the division.</p><p>"Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business," said Spencer during his appearance on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a>. "We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we're doing. It does mean we have to make tradeoffs through the year on things that we're going to invest more in. [And] things that we're not going to invest as much in, because we are the business that we are. But the business is having really good success."</p><p>Spencer touted Game Pass as "having an amazing year" and praised Xbox's first-party games for their performance in 2025. It's worth noting that Spencer has used similar language about running "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/" data-ref-id="1100-6524121">a sustainable business</a>" to explain the closures of studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks.</a> The latter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">successfully revived by its new owner</a>, Krafton, but other studios weren't as lucky and numerous devs lost their jobs.</p><p>Additionally, Spencer has explained repeatedly that the decision to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> and other former Xbox-exclusive titles to PlayStation was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">a business call</a>. That proved to be a fortuitous choice for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a>, both of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topped PSN charts in April</a>.</p><p>During his podcast appearance, Spencer said that watching <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keeper-is-the-new-double-fine-adventure-and-it-looks-wild/1100-6532262/" data-ref-id="1100-6532262">Keeper</a> come together for the Xbox Games Showcase "reignited my Double Fine love."

                <p>Gamers may have noticed a recent email about instructions for getting their share of a legal settlement with GameStop. While people are right to be suspicious about emails promising money, this settlement is legitimate. And if you've purchased something online from GameStop in the last five years, then the company may owe you some money.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Settlement%20Agreement.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a class-action settlement</a> filed earlier this year, GameStop <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Notice.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has put forth $4.5 million</a> to resolve the issue of whether the company improperly disclosed customers' personal information to Facebook via the Facebook Tracking Pixel (now Meta Pixel) without their permission.</p><h3>Who can file a claim for their share of the settlement?</h3><p>There are two primary criteria for getting a share this settlement. Recipients are only eligible if they purchased a video game from GameStop's site between August 18, 2020 and April 17, 2025. Players also need to have maintained a public Facebook profile with their real names at the time the purchase was made.</p><h3>What's the settlement amount per person?</h3><p>GameStop customers who qualify for the settlement can choose between a cash payment of up to $5 in cash or up to $10 as a voucher that can be used on GameStop's site. Players who opt for the former can receive payments through Paypal, Venmo, and Zelle. Those who opt for the voucher will receive the credit through their GameStop account. The voucher will expire one year after it is received.</p><h3>How can a claim be filed?</h3><p>There are two options to file a claim. Customers can either <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Home/SubmitClaim" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fill out this online form</a> or print out <a href="https://www.gamestopvppasettlement.com/Content/Documents/Claim%20Form.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this PDF form</a>, complete the requested information, and mail it to the following address:</p><p>GameStop VPPA Settlement Administrator</p><p>P.O. Box 4129</p><p>Portland, OR 97208-4129</p><h3>What's the deadline to file a claim?</h3><p>The deadline to file a claim or to object to the class settlement is August 15, 2025. The date of the final approval hearing is September 18, 2025. All payments and vouchers are expected to be distributed 55 days after the final approval of the deal and the conclusion of any appeals.</p>

                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars. While Microsoft has yet to elaborate on how the company will celebrate that milestone, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has indicated that 2026 will be "really special" for Xbox fans with returning franchises.</p><p>"When you think about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">Fable</a>, when you think about Gears, when you think about Forza, I mean, these are franchises that have been really part of what makes Xbox what it is today," said Spencer on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. "And it's going to be a nice lineup next year. I love the games that we've launched so far in [2025]. I think, as you already went through, we have a strong finish to 2025. And then when I look at [2026] and our 25th anniversary and the franchises that we're going to launch in that year, I think it's going to be a really special year for Xbox next year."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a> is one of the Xbox titles expected to arrive in 2026 alongside Fable and a new Forza game. Last fall, Microsoft shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">ambitious plans for the Halo franchise</a>, but it's unknown if a new title in the franchise will arrive in 2026. It's possible that another remake or remaster of the original Halo will be released next year.</p><p>Spencer's latest interview didn't mention whether next year's marquee Xbox titles will also be coming to PlayStation 5. The decision to release <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/" data-ref-id="1900-6418359">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-on-ps5-releases-in-april/1100-6529770/" data-ref-id="1100-6529770">Forza Horizon 5</a> on Sony's console led to both games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/microsoft-titles-top-the-charts-for-best-selling-games-on-psn-in-april-2025/2900-6532/" data-ref-id="2900-6532">topping the PSN charts in April</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>--which was published by Microsoft-owned Bethesda--also placed among PSN's top 20 titles for April, and DLC is coming later this year.</p><p>The original Xbox launched on November 15, 2001 in North America. Presumably Microsoft will disclose its anniversary plans before that date in 2026.</p>
