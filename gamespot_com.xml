                <p>Take-Two's story of the day may be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Grand Theft Auto 6's delay to late 2026</a>, but the company's investor call also revealed some info about its other titles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> fell short of the publisher's sales expectations despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">the biggest launch in franchise history</a> and its debut as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">the third-highest selling game of 2025</a>.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick laid the blame for Borderlands 4's performance on the optimization problems plaguing the PC port.</p><p>"The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb, and we're really happy with the release," said Zelnick. "Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. [Developer] Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great."</p><p>It's true that some PC players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-getting-clobbered-on-steam-with-negative-reviews/1100-6534683/" data-ref-id="1100-6534683">review bombed Borderlands 4 on Steam</a> about its performance and optimization issues. In response, Gearbox Studios CEO Randy Pitchford openly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-calls-people-4k-stubborn-disputes-reports-of-performance-issues/1100-6534746/" data-ref-id="1100-6534746">challenged players' negative reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/randy-pitchford-remains-defiant-about-borderlands-4-pc-issues/1100-6534798/" data-ref-id="1100-6534798">remained defiant about it days later</a>. Pitchford also shared a number of tips for better performance on PC and consoles.</p><p>However, the PC sales figures may not tell the whole story. The American/Canadian console sales for October 2025 haven't been released yet, but PlayStation's list of the top downloads for North America reveal that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/05/playstation-store-october-2025s-top-downloads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped to 14th place</a> after <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/02/playstation-store-september-2025s-top-downloads" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">debuting at number three</a> a month earlier. This suggests a broader dissatisfaction with the game beyond PC users, and the PS5 version did have some optimization issues as well.</p><p>Later this month, Gearbox will drop Borderlands 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/" data-ref-id="1100-6535395">first paid DLC pack</a>, and the developer debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-a-legendary-bee-shooting-gun-you-can-farm-for-this-week/1100-6536003/" data-ref-id="1100-6536003">a bee-shooting legendary weapon</a> this week. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-has-been-delayed/1100-6534965/" data-ref-id="1100-6534965">Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4</a> remains indefinitely delayed for now.</p>

                <p>Skydance Games is once again pushing back its upcoming action game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra/">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>--although it hasn't given any new details about when to expect the game, except "beyond early 2026."</p><p>The publisher announced the delay on its Twitter. "Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is an ambitious project, and we are committed to ensuring it meets the level of quality that our team, players, and fans expect," the announcement reads.</p><p>To that end, Skydance Games, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed/1100-6531490/" data-ref-id="1100-6531490">already delayed the game</a> to early 2026, has announced that it is once again pushing the date beyond that window.</p><p>You can read the full statement below:</p><p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra is the first game from Skydance New Media, a developer founded in 2019 by the similarly named film studio. Amy Hennig, of Uncharted fame, is the studio's president and is leading development on the title as well, which puts players in the shoes of four playable characters, including Black Panther and Captain America, as well as a Gabriel Jones, a member of the Howling Commandos, and Nanali, a Wakandan spy leader.</p><p>As suggested by the game's title, Rise of Hydra is set during World War II in Nazi-occupied Paris, but--in true action-adventure form--the game will span the globe and take players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-will-be-set-in-occupied-paris-wakanda-and-beyond/1100-6528536/" data-ref-id="1100-6528536">Wakanda and beyond</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Take-Two Interactive is using some AI tools in areas of its business that aren't creative, but the company is not looking to use those tools to replace any staff, CEO Strauss Zelnick said during Take-Two's November earnings call.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think there are plenty of areas of business where the tools we have rolled out at the enterprise are helping us. We are not either using this as an excuse to, or frankly seeing the opportunity to, reduce headcount," Zelnick said on the call, answering a question about how Take-Two has rolled out AI tools in the non-creative areas of its business. "We are seeing this as an opportunity to take our very talented people and release them from more mundane tasks so they can do more creative and more interesting tasks and we can work better as an organization. But if you said, 'Can you cut your cost profile by 5% tomorrow by using all things AI?' The answer is no."</p><p dir="ltr">Zelnick has previously said in interviews that he thinks the capabilities of generative AI tools are overstated, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-believe-ai-can-compete-with-grand-theft-auto/1100-6535814/">AI can't replace games made by humans like Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. During the earnings call, he clarified those comments somewhat, but he also reiterated that he thinks AI can potentially be a useful tool in game development in the future, if "properly deployed."</p><p dir="ltr">"To be clear, I didn't say that I don't see it as a positive," Zelnick said. "What I said was that AI is based on backward-looking data sets meeting compute, meeting LLMs, and none of that replaces forward-looking genius. That's not an opinion, that's factual. I defy anyone to controvert those facts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Of course, technology drives a lot of what we do here. Now, creativity is our lifeblood, but how do we express our creativity? We do so with computers, with technical tools. We always have. So as toolsets improve, we can become more efficient, we can become more effective. And our creative people, therefore, are freed up to be more creative. So AI, depending on how you define it, and properly deployed, of course is positive for creativity, and therefore is, of course, positive for game creation."</p><p>Zelnick's comments that AI won't lead to layoffs at Take-Two come in contrast to other executives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/">Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a> have both said that AI advancements will lead to job losses in the short term, though they claim AI will eventually lead to higher employment rates.</p>

                <p>Major League Baseball wrapped up its 2025 season last week, and now, Sony San Diego Studios is looking ahead to the 13th iteration of MLB The Show. As expected, MLB The Show 26 is in development and the team behind the game is pulling the curtain back on a few of the features that will be included.</p><p>Sony shared the MLB The Show 26 details on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/06/goal-setting-mlb-the-show-26/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official PlayStation blog</a>. Next year's game will introduce Road To The Show's high school and college modes, as well as a focus on players' mid-to-late careers. Meanwhile, Diamond Dynasty is adding two new experiences, Diamond Quest and Weekend Classic. However, the team didn't elaborate on what those experiences entail.</p><p>Franchise mode has been adjusted to be "more strategic and rewarding" in the offseason, with no further details in that area. Some of the subtle changes to the game include new animations and a revamped throw meter. The popular Negro Leagues storylines will continue with Season 4, which will once again revisit some of the players whose achievements were overlooked for decades.</p><p>Players who want to get an early start on next year's game can earn up to 26 The Show packs by playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. Earning a Now &amp; Later pack in 25 will allow players to redeem a Show pack when 26 is released by signing into the title with the same account they used for the previous game</p><p>Fans who sign up for The Show's <a href="https://account.theshow.com/scoutingreport" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Scouting Report</a> by November 15 will earn five Now &amp; Later packs. On November 21, Now &amp; Later packs will be available to earn in MLB The Show 25 in the 11th Inning XP path. By early 2026, there will be a dedicated Now &amp; Later program in the game.</p><p>Sony hasn't set a date for MLB The Show 26, but the yearly editions traditionally arrive in March.</p>

In the aptly-titled Celeste's Journal quest in Arc Raiders, you'll need to visit two separate locations on opposite ends of the Dam Battlegrounds map to collect this trader's possessions, so strap in for quite a raid.</p><p>If you want to make things easier on yourself for Celeste's Journals, you'll want to equip an augment with a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with both of the journals and return to Speranza to complete this quest. This can be tough to pull off due to the long trek you'll need to make through potentially dangerous areas to gather both of them, so also be sure to bring a decent gun and enough ammo to keep you feeling safe.</p><p>When you're ready to set off and finish this challenging quest, follow the steps below.
