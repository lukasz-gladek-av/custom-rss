                <p>Everyone knew that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/" data-ref-id="1100-6532411">Nintendo Switch 2</a> was going to be the hottest game console of 2025, but someone has provided an entirely different kind of heat. Earlier this month, thieves stole nearly 3,000 Nintendo Switch 2 consoles out of a truck without being detected until it was too late.</p><p>A semi-truck driver reported the theft on June 8 at a truck stop in Bennett, Colorado. The driver told police that he discovered the missing Switch 2 boxes while performing a pre-trip inspection. Police determined that 2,810 Switch 2 consoles were taken.</p><p>"They retail at $499. The cost to Nintendo is just over $410," said Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office public information officer Anders Nelson. "So either way you look at it, it's well over $1 million worth of merchandise stolen."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fp0MGCgz2Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-fp0MGCgz2Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/crime/nintendo-switch-theft-truck-colorado/73-27ca5808-6901-4229-b1b4-4862c73b300b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">9NBC</a>'s report, MSU Denver computer science professor Steve Beaty noted that the thieves may use the Dark Web to sell the stolen consoles, but that doesn't mean the trail has gone entirely cold for Nintendo or the police. They can potentially identify the stolen consoles by their serial numbers when they go online.</p><p>"Nintendo does have the capability of what we call bricking the device and that is to make it nonfunctional," added Beaty.</p><p>In the past, Nintendo has gone to great lengths to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">track down and identify Switch 1 pirates</a>, so it's entirely plausible that the company will flag any stolen Switch 2 consoles that show up on its radar. But for now, the thieves behind this truck stop heist have yet to be caught.</p><p>Players in Japan have had such difficulty getting Switch 2 consoles because of resellers jacking up the price that they've been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/japan-is-getting-goofy-with-switch-2-marketplace-listings/1100-6532415/" data-ref-id="1100-6532415">posting parody listings for it on third-party marketplaces</a>. Fans who have gotten a hold of Switch 2 consoles have also been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-mounting-their-switch-2-in-creative-and-also-really-stupid-places/1100-6532498/" data-ref-id="1100-6532498">mounting them in creative and stupid ways</a>.</p>
