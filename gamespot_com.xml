                <p>Nintendo is reportedly set to announce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on January 16, and Walmart Canada--known for upsetting video game developers by leaking announcements early--has chimed in with a meme of its own.</p><p>Today, January 14, the Walmart Canada Gaming account posted the popular image of Mario peeking from behind a curtain. "Hey, Mario," the post said, with the waving-hand emoji. Walmart Canada is no doubt referencing the rumors of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">forthcoming Switch 2 reveal</a>.</p><p>What's noteworthy here is that Walmart Canada has a semi-lengthy history of spoiling major announcements by posting product pages ahead of official announcements. As of yet, however, Walmart Canada hasn't spoiled anything about the Switch 2.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/788900063833493504" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Mario curtain image dates back to 2016</a>, when Nintendo of America used it to promote the announcement of the Switch, which was then known as "NX." It was meant to suggest that Nintendo would soon pull back the curtain on the device. It quickly became a meme, and some thought it was kind of creepy. Former Nintendo staffers later discussed how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-former-staff-say-infamously-weird-mario-curtain-photo-wont-happen-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo was aware of the reaction</a> and would never do something like that again.</p><p>Walmart Canada's leaks have included the first reveal of Rage 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2018-bethesda-vp-pete-hines-drags-walmart-canad/1100-6459642/" data-ref-id="1100-6459642">prompting Bethesda to drag the retailer in comments during E3 2018.</a> Also in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-reacts-to-rage-2-possibly-being-leaked-be/1100-6458836/" data-ref-id="1100-6458836">Walmart Canada leaked Borderlands 3, Gears 5, Just Cause 4, and other titles</a>.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming account is run by Riley Little. He <a href="https://www.walmartcanada.ca/news/2022/11/16/gamers-united-the-success-story-of-walmart-canada-gamings-twitter-account#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIf%20Walmart%20was%20a%20person,more%20than%20three%20years%20ago." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a blog post in 2022</a> that it came down from above that Walmart Canada could do a better job communicating to gamers, and it was his idea to make the account "more approachable and more interesting." To achieve this, Little started posting all kinds of memes, as well as straight news and product announcements to drive people to shop at Walmart.</p><p>Walmart Canada's gaming leaks, though, have slowed down significantly in recent years. After all, video game developers and publishers generally do not enjoy having their unannounced information emerge early. As such, it would be shocking to see Walmart Canada actually reveal anything legitimate about the Switch 2, though you never know. Outside of Walmart Canada, the internet has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-breaks-its-silence-on-recent-switch-2-leaks/1100-6528735/" data-ref-id="1100-6528735">full of Switch leaks</a>. </p><p>If the rumors prove to be accurate, Nintendo could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-reveal-coming-this-week-launch-expected-may-or-june-report/1100-6528763/" data-ref-id="1100-6528763">announce the Switch 2 on Thursday, January 16</a>, with the console then going on sale in May or June.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Sims is turning 25 this year, and EA has announced that a trio of new Kits are scheduled to hit <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/">The Sims 4</a> later this week to celebrate the franchise's 25th anniversary.</p><p dir="ltr">The news was announced via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk">a livestreamed</a> episode of Behind The Sims, which was posted to the official Sims YouTube channel. The stream featured a number of well-known "Simmers": players who stream their Sims 4 gameplay on Twitch or YouTube. In fact, one of the upcoming Kits was created in collaboration with LilSimsie, a popular Sims 4 content creator known for her elaborate house builds.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FryVzV0aJdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FryVzV0aJdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As for the Kits, their official titles haven't yet been announced, but we do know when they're arriving: All three Kits will be available for purchase on January 16, and although their price has yet to be confirmed, Sims 4 Kits normally cost $5 USD, so it's likely that players will be able to get their hands on all three of the new Kits for a total of $15.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the actual content included in these Kits, EA was a little more forthcoming.</p><p dir="ltr">"Two of the Kits are a mixture of Build/Buy [Mode items] and Create-A-Sim items inspired by Sims icons," LilSimsie shared during the livestream. "And the last one? Well, that one was made in collaboration with me!"</p><p dir="ltr">Given LilSimsie's well-known love for creating extravagant lots in Build Mode, it's likely that the Kit she collaborated on will include a good number of new items for players to build in-game homes with.</p><p dir="ltr">But these mysterious new Kits aren't the only thing players have to look forward to: According to the schedule shared in the livestream, the game's main menu is getting a total UI revamp, which has already gone live. Additionally, EA has announced that the MySims: Cozy Bundle will come to PC on March 18 (currently, it's only available to play on Nintendo Switch). Lastly, The Sims FreePlay will get a new update on February 4 that pays homage to the era in which the game first launched back in 2000.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Sims FreePlay has an exciting update planned!" EA shared. "Starting February 4, we're taking you back to the 2000s, where The Sims all began. Participate in special events, unlock velour tracksuits, and enjoy 25 days of in-game gifts featuring some of the most iconic items from The Sims' history!"</p><p dir="ltr">For more information on the new Sims 4 Kits, the MySims: Cozy Bundle, and The Sims FreePlay update, check out <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/behind-the-sims-episode-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's recent blog post</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> seventh seasonal update, Season of Witchcraft, arrives on January 21 and will give players a whole new set of fan-favorite powers from an old Diablo class to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the new 25 Witchcraft Powers are taken almost directly from abilities used by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3's</a> Witch Doctor. The class hasn't made its way to Diablo 4 officially just yet, but Blizzard isn't being shy about paying homage to the frog-slinging mystic. Powers like Firebat Servants, various Hexes, Poison Frog Servants, Soul Harvest, and Piranhado are all taken from the Witch Doctor's Diablo 3 playbook and will be usable by any class.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521"></a><figcaption>Everything new that's coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 7.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To earn those Witchcraft Powers and others, players will need to aid a coven underneath the Tree of Whispers by completing new Whisper bounties and hunting down Headrotten enemies that have been stolen from the Tree of Whispers. Like some previous seasons, specific zones on the map will periodically transform into Headhunt zones where numerous Headrotten enemies can be found. After completing bounties in the zone, there is a rare chance for an Uprooted Cocoon to spawn a deadly boss that, once slain, can be returned to the coven underneath the Tree of Whispers for a greater reward. Players can also discover Rootholds within Headrotten zones. These seasonal dungeons need a key to unlock, but will further aid players in increasing their standing with the coven. The Tree of Whispers will additionally have a chance of rewarding players with an Ancestral Collection, which guarantees at least one Ancestral item.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new powers, players will be able to equip new Occult Gems that will further enhance their Witchcraft Powers. Many gems have effects that enhance specific categories of Witchcraft powers or are activated once a player equips a certain number of powers from a particular category. In addition to their unique effects, each Occult Gem grants 160 Armor and 8% Resist All, which should make them an attractive choice for those looking to take full advantage of their Witchcraft Powers.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big addition in Diablo 4 Season 7 is the Armory, a feature that will actually be a permanent feature going forward. Players will be able to create up to five loadouts per character that can be easily swapped between with the click of a button. Doing so will automatically equip the skills, Paragon Board, Glyphs, and gear saved to the loadout, allowing players to easily change builds without having to constantly reset their skill tree or Paragon Board. It will not cost gold to swap loadouts using the Armory--once a skill tree and Paragon Board have been saved to the Armory, that build can be swapped free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Other permanent changes coming in Season of Witchcraft include an improved layout to the area around the Tree of Whispers, as well as making it so each specific class quest only needs to be completed once per class. Players who afterward make a new character of the same class will be able to access their unique class power earlier without having to do the requisite quest. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">welcome back level boost</a> will be sticking around permanently, and Unique items with Greater Affixes will also be improved, with Unique powers having their minimum rolls increased when the item sports a Greater Affix. There is additionally a new Unique item for each class, and for Vessel of Hatred owners, three new runes to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard will share more details about Diablo 4 Season 7 during a developer livestream on January 16. Diablo 4 Season 6 revolved around the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-how-to-unlock-and-equip-runewords/1100-6527208/" data-ref-id="1100-6527208">Runewords</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/" data-ref-id="1100-6527178">Mercenaries</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">co-op-only dungeon</a>.</p>
