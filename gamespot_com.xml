That, however, is not the case, as the game is an eight-player, multiplayer-focused PvPvE title.

<p dir="ltr">Rather than making a character from scratch, players will get to choose from over a dozen unique characters that have their "own identity and appearance," as well as unique weapons. Each character will have a weapon or tool to deal damage at a distance, as well the ability to summon an NPC to help them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Every Bloodsworn hero can also be customized. Miyazaki said characters can be "customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own." Customization comes in the form of altering each character's "blood history and fate," Miyazaki said, which will have an effect on character abilities, appearance, and even how they might interact with other players. Progression will come from playing matches and completing objectives, which can then be used to further upgrade and customize each Bloodsworn character.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what players are actually trying to do during a session of The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said players will be competing to complete objectives, obtain Victory Points, and be the last Bloodsworn standing. There will also be personal objectives or special events to complete that will grant various rewards. Players will have some control over these, as Miyazaki said players can assign a "Role" to their character that may see players rewarded for teaming up with or eliminating a specific target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big departure for From Software's usual RPG fare, but already sounds similar to the studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. The multiplayer Elden Ring spin-off also features a roster of hero-like characters to choose from, as players team up to survive and defeat bosses over the course of a match. From Software recently revealed a new playable hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Elden Ring: Nightreign, the bow-wielding Ironeye</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the multiplayer focus of both Nightreign and The Duskbloods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said From Software isn't giving up on single-player games</a>. He also said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-softwares-switch-2-exclusive-was-originally-pitched-for-the-original-switch/1100-6530618/" data-ref-id="1100-6530618">The Duskbloods originally started as a project for the first Nintendo Switch</a>, before revamping the game's development with the new Switch 2 hardware in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">The Switch 2 is still currently set to release on June 5</a>, though preorders in the US have now been delayed as a result of new US tariff policies that could result in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">price increase</a> or a delay.

                <p>The first box-office numbers for A Minecraft Movie have arrived, with the Warner Bros. video game movie bringing in $10.55 million at the domestic box office for its Thursday previews.</p><p>For comparison, the video game movie Five Nights at Freddy's made $10.3 million in the US for its previews, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie brought in $26.5 million.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/minecraft-movie-box-office-previews-1236358670/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety supplied the numbers</a>, and added that A Minecraft Movie is projected to earn between $70 million-$80 million for its opening weekend in the US. For its part, Warner Bros. is penciling in a a more conservative projection of $65 million. Some estimates, Variety said, peg A Minecraft Movie at $90 million for its first weekend.</p><p>Another point of comparison is Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which made $60 million in the US for its opening weekend, going on to bring in $236 million stateside and $255 million from international markets for a total of $491 million globally.</p><p>Globally, box-office estimates suggest A Minecraft Movie could make as much as $150 million over its first weekend. The movie carried a production cost of $150 million, with many millions upon millions more spent on marketing. Despite those hefty costs, Variety said A Minecraft Movie is poised to become a financial success. This would be good news for Warner Bros., as the company's recent releases, Mickey 17 and The Alto Knights, failed to perform up to expectations.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Daniella Brooks, Sebastian Hansen, and Emmy Myers. It's directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess.</p><p>Like some of Hess' other movies, A Minecraft Movie is getting mixed reviews from critics. It has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 score on GameSpot sister site Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">49% on Rotten Tomatoes.</a> GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie review</a> scored the film a 7/10. Reviewer Chris Hayner said, "As you sit down in theaters this weekend, it's time to let your sense of childhood wonderment take over for a little while. I don't think you'll regret it."</p>

Originally scheduled to start on April 9, a Nintendo representative has since confirmed this date has been pushed back indefinitely in order for the company to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." As such, it is likely we will see an sizeable increase in the console's price before it is relisted.</p><p>The full statement, which was given to GameSpot via a Nintendo spokesperson, can be found below:</p><p>"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged."</p><p>Nintendo's latest console has already been the subject of scrutiny--and more than a few<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-price-roasted-by-duolingo/1100-6530617/" data-ref-id="1100-6530617"> jokes</a>--due to its $450 price tag and the cost of its upcoming first-party titles. Following its reveal, Mario Kart World made headlines as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">Nintendo's priciest game</a> that doesn't include a physical accessory. And yet, it seems like prices will only go up from here.</p><p>For months now, experts have speculated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/#comments-block-33629463" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">President Trump's proposed tariffs</a> would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">significant ramifications</a> for the video game industry. Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> that Nintendo is likely to "feel the impact" of the <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907541343250878752" rel="nofollow ">tariffs on places like Vietnam and Japan</a>, where many Switch 2 units are produced. MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3lludkrrvmc2r" rel="nofollow ">FT</a> that Nintendo had already shipped more than 350,000 Switch 2 units to the USA back in January in an attempt to get ahead of the tariffs. It was also previously speculated by Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis that a Switch 2 "price increase in 2026 might be on the table" if tariffs persist.</p><p>Of course some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage Nintendo to produce Switch 2 units in the United States. However, Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p><p>During Trump's first presidency, tariffs did not apply to video game consoles because console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/">successfully lobbied the government for a special exception.</a> This time, however, it would appear we are seeing the consequences unfold.</p>
