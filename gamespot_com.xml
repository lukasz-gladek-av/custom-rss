                <p>Last month, Microsoft held its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct</a> of 2025 and announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-2-black-drops-today-included-in-xbox-game-pass/1100-6528989/" data-ref-id="1100-6528989">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> among other titles. But fans won't have to wait very long to learn what else Microsoft's gaming division has planned for the future, as the next Xbox Showcase is scheduled to take place in February.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/idxbox-showcase-to-kick-off-ign-fan-fest-2025?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, this year's IGN Fan Fest will begin with an Xbox Showcase on February 24. Aside from the reveal of "the next big collaboration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/balatro-review-one-more-blind/1900-6418192/" data-ref-id="1900-6418192">Balatro</a>," details are scarce about what to specifically expect beyond trailers and gameplay footage. However, the announcement of the showcase does note that there will be several reveals from indie studios including Raw Fury, Team 17, Akapura, 11 Bit, and more.</p><p>During one of last year's Xbox Showcases, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-release-date-announced-during-xbox-showcase/1100-6524083/" data-ref-id="1100-6524083">World Of Warcraft: The War Within</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-report/1100-6523727/" data-ref-id="1100-6523727">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, as well as 2025 titles including South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Fragpunk, and Fable. We can only speculate which titles will be showcased in February, but we'd certainly like to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, the upcoming prequel to the long-running shooter franchise.</p><p>With Microsoft's push to release more games on PlayStation 5, it's possible that some cross-platform announcements will also be a part of this Xbox Direct. Microsoft recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/" data-ref-id="1100-6529156">Forza Horizon 5</a> is coming to PS5, and there have been rumors for months that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> may be going to Sony's console as well. Doom: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> are also headed to PS5 later this year.</p>

                <p>In 2014, Sony showed off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-beyond-good-evil-creator-reveals-a-ps4-excl/1100-6421676/" data-ref-id="1100-6421676">the first look</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-canceled/" data-ref-id="5000-306239">Wild</a>, an ambitious open-world PlayStation-exclusive game from the creator of Rayman, Michel Ancel. Wild remained in development until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-exclusive-wild-has-reportedly-been-canceled/1100-6495395/" data-ref-id="1100-6495395">it was canceled in 2021</a>, almost a year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-retires-but-beyond-good-evil-2-will-go-on/1100-6482347/" data-ref-id="1100-6482347">Ancel retired from the video game industry</a>. Now, former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts about why Wild was canceled.</p><p>"There [were] lots of great ideas [that] didn't really materialize into the actual game structure," explained Yoshida during an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtiJlzs0xRE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MinnMax</a>. "It was very open kind of thinking... one of the earliest [pitches] was the map size of the game was the size of Europe."</p><p>As envisioned by Ancel, Wild would have taken place during prehistoric times as players stepped into a the role of a human whose shaman-like powers gave them the ability to influence or control animals. Smaller animals could be used to spy on other tribes, while larger animals could actually be possessed by the player to guide them to accomplish a specific goal or objective. Animals could also support the player in battles against rival tribes.</p><p>Following Ancel's retirement, Ubisoft opened an investigation into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-investigating-retired-rayman-creator-for-alleged-hostile-work-environment/1100-6482636/" data-ref-id="1100-6482636">whether he created a hostile work environment</a> for his employees at the company. Ancel denied the allegations and it doesn't appear that any action was taken against him. Additionally, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rayman-is-in-development-with-creator-michel-ancel-consulting/1100-6527358/" data-ref-id="1100-6527358">a new Rayman game in development</a>, and Ubisoft rehired Ancel to serve as a consultant on the project. The next Rayman title was announced late in 2024, and it doesn't currently have a release date from Ubisoft.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite's</a> upcoming Spring Update will add its first new power weapon since launch, and it's one that will be familiar, yet different, to longtime Halo fans--the Fuel Rod SPNKr.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly the Fuel Rod Cannon first introduced as a usable weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-2/" data-ref-id="5000-4788">Halo 2</a>, but rather a UNSC SPNKr rocket launcher that has been heavily modified by Halo Infinite's enemy faction, the Banished, to fire fuel rods.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZNxv526xa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YZNxv526xa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While the weapon shares many similarities with the franchise's classic Fuel Rod Cannon--like a large magazine and massive green bolts of exploding plasma--it does behave a little differently. Most notably, the Fuel Rod SPNKr's plasma bolts don't bounce off targets, acting more like Halo's traditional rocket launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Halo Studios (formerly 343 Industries) is currently on a roll when it comes to adding new weapons to Halo Infinite. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/footage-of-halo-infinites-dmr-style-m392-bandit-rifle-has-been-leaked/1100-6506883/" data-ref-id="1100-6506883">first new weapon, the Bandit DMR</a>, came three years after launch. However, Halo Studios added a new SMG, the MA5K Avenger, late last year and is now adding the Fuel Rod SPNKr just a few months later. In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/spring-update-2025-halo-infinite" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> outlining all the other new additions coming as part of Halo Infinite's 2025 Spring Update on February 4, the developer confirmed it's working on another new weapon in the form of a Banished-themed shotgun. That weapon is slated to arrive as part of Halo Infinite's Summer Update.</p><p dir="ltr">The Fuel Rod SPNKr may be the star attraction of the Spring Update, but Halo Studios is also bringing back a classic Halo 2 game mode in the form of the bomb-planting Assault. Other additions coming with the update include a remake of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-5-guardians/" data-ref-id="5000-182008">Halo 5</a> map Coliseum alongside weapon balance changes. The update will additionally overhaul the game's premium Operations Pass, adding more armor set to earn for those who decide to purchase it while making it so armor sets from old passes will be obtainable on The Exchange (Halo Infinite's in-game currency cosmetic shop) the season after they debut.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo Studios is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">multiple new Halo projects</a>, though the developer has not revealed what those projects are. The studio recently shifted to using Unreal Engine 5 to build future games in the series, in the process revealing Project Foundry, a prototype using Unreal Engine meant as a training tool that also shows what the future of Halo may look like. In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/10/06/halo-studios-unreal-engine-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> announcing the shift (and the studio's new name), it was said the studio rebrand and move to Unreal was the start of a new chapter for the franchise.
