                <p>Since Fields of Mistria was released in early access last year, the farm life fantasy RPG has received two major updates. Now, developer NPC Studio has announced that Fields of Mistria will be getting its third major update on July 21 with a brief teaser video.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FieldsofMistria/status/1940063226701451568" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fields of Mistria's 3rd Major Update arrives July 21st! ❤️<br>Romance is arriving with 8 heart events, dating, and even more new features! To see everything that's coming, check out our roadmap: <a href="https://t.co/xwcrQjIhIU" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/xwcrQjIhIU</a> <a href="https://t.co/9u7eVSwASX" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9u7eVSwASX</a></p>  — Fields of Mistria ✨ Out Now in Early Access (@FieldsofMistria) <a href="https://twitter.com/FieldsofMistria/status/1940063226701451568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Although the post on Fields of Mistria's X account says "romance is arriving," dating and romantic pursuits have already been a part of the game. There are, however, more romantic features being added including eight heart events for dateable NPCs, as well as eight heart NPC dialogue routes that can lead to either romance or friendship. The NPC heart cap is also being raised from six hearts to eight hearts, and a dating mechanic is being added.</p><p>There are new mines monsters on the way, with updated monster variant mechanics and unlockable cosmetic drops from monsters. Players who want their characters to be beloved by the town will be able to raise their Renown Level cap by five additional levels. New museum sets and rewards will also be added.</p><p>Skill caps are getting a dramatic raise from level 45 to level 60, and there's a new festival on the way in addition to two new unlockable Saturday Market vendors. Beyond those changes, cosmetic upgrades will give players the chance to customize their homes with furniture and decorations in addition to larger storage chests.</p><p>The complete notes for the update are below, but NPC Studio states that some of the details may be subject to change.</p><h3>Villagers &amp; Romance</h3><ul><li>NPC Heart cap raised from 6 hearts to 8 hearts</li><li>8 Heart events for dateable NPCs</li><li>8 Heart NPC dialogue (Romantic and Best Friend routes)</li><li>Dating mechanic</li></ul><h3>Mines &amp; Dungeon</h3><ul><li>New Mines Monsters</li><li>Updated Monster variant mechanics</li><li>New unlockable cosmetic drops from monsters</li></ul><h3>Renown &amp; Town</h3><ul><li>Renown Level cap raised by 5 levels</li><li>Additional Requests added to the Request Board</li><li>Additional Museum sets and rewards</li><li>New Town Repair Quests</li><li>2 new unlockable Saturday Market Vendors</li><li>New Festival</li></ul><h3>Skills &amp; Perks</h3><ul><li>Skill caps raised from level 45 to level 60</li><li>Additional Tier 4 &amp; 5 Skill Perks</li></ul><h3>Customization &amp; Cosmetics</h3><ul><li>Additional Home upgrade</li><li>Additional Player Cosmetics</li><li>Additional Furniture &amp; Decor</li></ul><h3>Misc.</h3><ul><li>Addition of larger storage chests</li><li>Updates to storage chest UI</li><li>Greenhouses</li><li>And more!</li></ul>
