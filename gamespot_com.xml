                <p>The <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently announced changes to Fortnite Crew</a> have been accompanied by some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4udhl/why_is_no_one_talking_about_the_massive_xp_nerf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">unpopular</a> <a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">changes</a> to XP gains in Chapter 6 Season 1, with progress slowing compared with past seasons--a jarring shift after the just-ended Remix season was overly generous with XP.</p><p>As with every new Fortnite season, players spent Chapter 6's launch day binge-playing the new battle royale map and trying out all the new weapons and items. But a lot of folks noticed something odd after playing all day--they weren't as far along in the new battle pass as they'd normally expect to be. Whereas dedicated players could usually earn 20 or 30 levels just from playing a lot on day 1, this time around, a lot of folks (including myself) found their gains grinding to a halt before they hit double digits.</p><p>This is reportedly the result of some newly implemented major changes to how XP is primarily gained in Fortnite. Season-long milestones for battle royale have been removed entirely, there is now just one set of three daily quests for all modes combined instead of quests for each mode, and XP in other modes (Lego, Reload, OG, Festival, Save the World, and Creative) is now primarily time-based and hard-capped weekly--it only takes a few hours to reach the cap, and after that gains are reduced to a trickle.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to dataminers</a>, Lego, Reload and OG modes all share one pool of weekly playtime XP, capping at 21 levels in total. Creative modes cap out at about 11 levels gained per week, Save the World caps out at nine levels, and Festival actually has a daily cap of just over one, single level. These caps only apply to passive, playtime-based XP, so any quests would provide an additional boost.</p><p>Battle royale and Zero Build, meanwhile, have had their passive XP removed entirely, which is why gains slow down so much once you finish the weekly and kickstart quests.</p><p>This is likely a consequence of the new changes to how Fortnite Crew works. With the new chapter, a Fortnite Crew subscription now includes the Lego Pass, the Music Pass, and the upcoming monthly OG Passes, but the rub is that you can only earn rewards on those passes while subscribed--you no longer get the battle pass for the duration for buying Crew at the start of the season. Since the price of a month of Crew didn't change, some trade-offs were to be expected, and so Epic Games rationing XP on a weekly basis so players progress at a more steady rate makes sense in that context.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a bit of a backlash to theses changes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h573kg/we_have_their_attention/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4x5on/does_epic_just_nerfed_the_daily_xp_of_each_mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reddit</a>, but Epic likely will wait and see how everybody feels in a couple weeks before making any changes. The company made a similar attempt to ration XP over the course of a season when Chapter 4 launched two years ago, with weekly quests that expired instead of staying until the season ended. It took nearly two months for Epic to revert that change, despite a similar response from fans. That said, this is the sort of thing that Epic can hotfix without a big update, so this status quo could change at any time.</p>

                <p>A low-quality video of what appears to be a Nintendo Switch 2 has emerged, prompting fan speculation over the as-yet-unseen console and the validity of this footage.</p><p>The video was posted on Chinese video site <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19GzdYSEhe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bibli</a> and was first spotted by <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/rumor-leaked-images-of-switch-2-joy-cons-surface-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leak-joycon-looks-like-release-date-1851711427?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). The footage appears to show someone removing a joycon from the side of the Switch 2 screen by simply pulling it off. The controllers themselves seem to sport infrared sensors (on both the left and right joycons) and bigger shoulder buttons. This matches <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/" data-ref-id="1100-6526551">previous leaks</a>, which suggested that the Switch 2 would have magnetic joycons and a more complex controller layout, though it would also maintain the same basic design as the original Switch. However, the blurry footage could be fake, and feature a version of the console constructed using information from prior leaks.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Edited video by me (since the original video is 5+ minutes long)</p><p>We can also see the man de-attaching the Joy-Cons at the beginning of the video <a href="https://t.co/RtIVDQJOlX" rel="nofollow   ">pic.twitter.com/RtIVDQJOlX</a></p></div>  â€” Adrien190303 #ThankYouToriyama (@Adrien190303) <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien190303/status/1863624665647792557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Details about the upcoming console are still scant. Nintendo has confirmed that an official announcement of the Switch 2 will arrive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">before April 2025</a>. The console was previously rumored to release in 2024, but reports early this year claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-might-now-release-in-2025-report/1100-6521168/" data-ref-id="1100-6521168">it had been delayed</a>.

Nintendo recently confirmed that the successor will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-play-switch-1-games-nintendo-confirms/1100-6527598/" data-ref-id="1100-6527598">backwards compatible</a>.

                <p>There's a new era for NASCAR games coming in 2025, but fans may want to grab the previous titles while they still can. Motorsport Games, the company that until recently held the rights to make NASCAR racing games, has announced that all of its NASCAR titles and associated DLC will be pulled from digital storefronts on December 31.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>To the NASCAR game community!</p><p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARHeat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARHeat</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARRivals</a>, andâ€¦ <a href="https://t.co/7RyCQXuZUo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7RyCQXuZUo</a></p></div>  â€” Motorsport Games (@MSportgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The silver lining from that announcement is that titles like NASCAR Heat, NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR: Ignition will be going on sale before the games are delisted. All of the affected games and their physical disc counterparts will remain playable after January 1, 2025, they just won't be directly available for online purchases. </p><p>NASCAR branded games date back to 1991 with Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge, and the license has been utilized by several different gaming publishers over the decades. The current NASCAR rights holder is iRacing, which reportedly plans to release NASCAR '25 across all consoles and PC in Fall 2025. </p><p>Real-life NASCAR racers have previously shown their support for games based on their events.

                <p>A new report alleges that PC hardware company NZXT's PC rental program is "shady and manipulative." The video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamers Nexus</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) accuses NZXT of changing prices and parts between "purchase" and "rental" versions of prebuilt PCs with the same (or similar) names.</p><p>For context, NZXT's Flex program allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 (though a renter would need to provide a monitor, keyboard, and mouse). Gamers Nexus claims that specs and prices of prebuilt PC models change depending on whether you select "buy" or "rent." The exact prices and specs can change "day to day" according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0pomC1CfpC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For example, the video shows that a "Player: Three Prime" model PC contained an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if a customer was set to buy it, whereas the rental version contained an RTX 4080 Super. However, the performance estimates--showing expected frame rates in certain games--did not change between the two models, despite containing significantly different hardware. These specs allegedly changed multiple times while Gamers Nexus was completing its report.</p><p>The Flex program's alleged issues don't stop there. Gamers Nexus highlights the Flex program's price point. Within nine or so months, the price of renting one of NZXT prebuilds will outstrip the cost of buying the PC (or its component parts) outright, with no rent-to-own option. Additionally, the report calls outs the program's "aggressive" terms of service, which allegedly allow NZXT to sell data created or stored on the rented PC.</p><p>NZXT has released a response on <a href="https://x.com/NZXT/status/1863388904205799769" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter,</a> which states, "We are aware of the recent claims made against us and are actively reviewing the situation. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing this thoroughly and will share an official statement soon. Thank you for your patience as we work to provide clarity."</p>

Now, Russian propaganda outlets are trying to spread the wild claim that Stalker 2 is somehow drafting players into the Ukraine military to fight off the Russian invasion.</p><p>As first reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, the video is being spread on Telegram with false claims that it originated from a report by Wired. Emails have also been sent to journalists claiming that Ukrainian developer GSC Game World is helping the government of Ukraine find "citizens suitable for mobilization" through an embedded program that collects player data and locations. It also contends that Ukraine provided funding for Stalker 2's development in exchange for that data.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/russian-disinfo-is-trying-to-spark-a-boycott-of-stalker-2-by-claiming-its-going-to-draft-you-into-the-war-in-ukraine-somehow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> points out that the video also encourages Stalker 2 fans to play the game with a VPN to avoid this supposed data collection. This suggests that the primary target of the propaganda isn't players in the West or in Ukraine, but rather fans in Russia. The Stalker franchise was popular in Russia before the invasion, and it remains so now. The video is likely an attempt to dissuade Russian players from engaging with the game or anything else that portrays Ukraine in a positive light.</p><p>The behind-the-scenes documentary <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/war-game-trailer-chronicles-the-making-of-stalker-2-during-wartime/1100-6526549/" data-ref-id="1100-6526549">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> chronicled the way that the Russian invasion upended the development of the game. Most of GSC Game World's team had to flee the country to finish the project, while others remained to fight in a real war. The developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-gets-day-one-patch-improvements-but-problems-remain-across-pc-and-xbox/1100-6527951/" data-ref-id="1100-6527951">released a day-one patch</a> to address some of Stalker 2's lingering issues.

Stalker 2 has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/day-one-game-pass-launch-stalker-2-crosses-major-sales-milestone/1100-6527971/" data-ref-id="1100-6527971">sold over 1 million copies across PC and Xbox</a>, and it's also available on Game Pass.</p>
