                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486">NBA 2K26</a> is releasing soon, and with it comes a whole new crop of rookie players looking to make their mark in the real world and the virtual one as well. To continue on with 2K26's ratings week, the developers have revealed the best rookies in the game at launch. While the first few members of the top 10 rookies are as expected, there are some shifts at the bottom of the list compared to how draft night went earlier in 2025.</p><p>Below, you can see the top 10 rookies in NBA 2K26 according to their ratings at launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh57YWNaQC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mh57YWNaQC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>NBA 2K26 rookie ratings</h2><p>We'll count down each of the top rookies by their rating below. There's certainly one outlier on the list, and you can probably guess who that is, but there are some other rookies you'll definitely want to keep your eye on as the NBA season begins.</p><h3>Cooper Flagg - 82 OVR</h3><p>Let's get first-round draft pick Cooper Flagg out of the way. The new Dallas Mavericks forward is given a rare 80+ rating for a rookie, which doesn't often happen unless 2K believes the player is a generational prospect. The jury is still out on Flagg as we haven't seen him in any real action yet, but he has the tools to be an immediate star.</p><h3>Dylan Harper - 78 OVR</h3><p>We're back to reality now, and second overall draft pick Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs comes in at the number two spot on the list. If Cooper Flagg wasn't in the draft, Harper is the first overall choice by a landslide, and the Spurs are certainly building something special between him and Victor Wembanyama.</p><h3>Ace Bailey - 77 OVR</h3><p>Ace Bailey was the fifth overall draft pick in 2025, but he should've been a higher selection under normal circumstances. Bailey had an interesting pre-draft process, to say the least, that dropped his draft stock slightly, but his talent is undeniable. Bailey should be firmly in the running for Rookie of the Year along with Flagg and Harper.</p><h3>V.J. Edgecombe - 76 OVR</h3><p>There's significant hype around what V.J. Edgecombe could bring to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2025 and beyond. Edgecombe is an intriguing prospect with tools to make an impact on both sides of the ball, and could form a lethal duo with second-year player Jared McCain.</p><h3>Kon Knueppel -75 OVR</h3><p>Kon Knueppel was the fourth overall draft pick, going to the Charlotte Hornets. While the Hornets likely won't be in contention during the 2025 season, Knueppel could find his way into the starting roster based on what we saw in the NBA Summer League, where he was named MVP.</p><h3>Tre Johnson - 75 OVR</h3><p>Tre Johnson was considered a fantastic value pick by the Washington Wizards in the 2025 draft. Coming out of Texas, Johnson could have gone as high as third overall, according to some analysts, but wound up in Washington, where he gets to learn from several savvy veterans and showcase his offensive talent.</p><h3>Khaman Maluach - 74 OVR</h3><p>Khaman Maluach is the first player to be rated outside of where he was drafted. Maluach was drafted tenth overall by the Rockets, but he wound up traded to the Phoenix Suns, where there's room for some young talent to shine after the departure of Kevin Durant.</p><h3>Jeremiah Fears - 73 OVR</h3><p>Jeremiah Fears is up next, coming in at 73 OVR after he was drafted seventh overall by the New Orleans Pelicans. Fears will need some time to develop at the NBA level, but he has the potential to make a huge impact on an always-struggling Pelicans roster.</p><h3>Egor Demin - 72 OVR</h3><p>Egor Demin was drafted by the Brooklyn Nets eighth overall in the draft. Demin has the potential to be one of the best passers in the NBA. However, Demin needs to shore up his shooting ability at the next level if he wants to be rated any higher.</p><h3>Collin Murray-Boyles - 72 OVR</h3><p>Rounding out the list of the top 10 rookies is Toronto Raptors draft pick Collin Murray-Boyles. Coming out of South Carolina, Murray-Boyles was renowned for his defense and niche offensive abilities. Comparisons to Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday were made all throughout the draft process, and that's certainly not a bad mold for the Raptors' rookie.</p><p>That does it for the top 10 list of the best rookies in NBA 2K26.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> fans can look forward to a new addition to the roster later this month, with the arrival of Wuyang. The new support-class hero looks like he'd fight right into the world of Avatar: The Last Airbender, and this new gameplay trailer for the character shows how he uses unique water-based abilities to disrupt enemies while also protecting his allies.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6ZEN5MVJaU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C6ZEN5MVJaU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wuyang will officially debut in Season 18 of Overwatch 2 when it kicks off on August 26, but players can also take him for a spin in a Hero Trial from August 14-18. Blizzard has also confirmed the abilities that Wuyang can wield in combat and his perks, and it looks like he's designed to be a mobile medic. Here's a closer look at his skills.</p><h2>Wuyang Abilities</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549244" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549244"></a><figcaption>Wuyang</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549244-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_002.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549245,1300-4549246,1300-4549247,1300-4549248,1300-4549249" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549245-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_guardianwave_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549246-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_restorativestream_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549247-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_rushingtorrent_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549248-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_abilities_tidalblast_001.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4549249-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><h3>Xuanwu Staff</h3><p><strong>Primary attack:</strong> Fire a damaging Water Orb.

                <p dir="ltr">Watch out for the Benzies family in Schedule 1, as the rival cartel has been introduced to the game for players on the beta branch. In addition, the patch notes reveal more that's been added to the drug-dealing title. A vehicle called the Hotbox and a pump shotgun can now be found within the game, too, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer TVGS announced the rollout of the Schedule 1 cartel update for beta players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. It's noted that you won't interact with the Benzies family until unlocking "a few customers in Westville." After that, expect to make some deals with the family as well as face some ambushes and dealer robbings. After finishing the storyline with the Benzies crew, Schedule 1 players can purchase Hyland Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">The Schedule 1 update also alters how new regions become available to players. The cartel influence level has to be lowered to a certain threshold before moving on to another area, per the patch notes. TVGS apologized to the fanbase that this patch has taken longer than expected, after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/">Schedule 1 players voted for the cartel update</a> over other options in June.</p><p dir="ltr">Schedule 1 launched in March, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/drug-selling-game-explodes-on-steam-charts-surpassing-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530401/">seeing huge success on Steam</a> with over 111,000 concurrent players at the time. The game hit an all-time peak of 459,075 concurrent players on Steam in April, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/#3m" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. Schedule 1 had just over 11,400 concurrent players on Valve's platform at the time of publication.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for the v0.4.0 open beta are below:</p><h4 dir="ltr">Additions</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Added the Benzies family - a powerful rival cartel in Hyland Point.

You must reduce this influence to a certain level before you can progress to the next region.</li><li dir="ltr">In multiplayer, you can view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs.</li><li dir="ltr">Deals are now cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious.</li><li dir="ltr">Unconscious NPCs who drop into the ocean are now killed.</li><li dir="ltr">Dead/unconscious NPCs can now be pickpocketed.</li><li dir="ltr">You can now pickpocket police.</li><li dir="ltr">If you attack a customer, they will not order from you for 72 hours.</li><li dir="ltr">Tweaks the braking properties of all vehicles.</li><li dir="ltr">Non-police NPCs can now use ranged weapons.</li><li dir="ltr">Police and NPCs in combat will now sometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.</li><li dir="ltr">Tweaked flashlight brightness.</li><li dir="ltr">Refactored a number of minor scripts.</li></ul><h4 dir="ltr">Bug fixes</h4><ul><li dir="ltr">Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed the networth calculator algorithm not factoring in some item quantities.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li><li dir="ltr">Fixed some missing fonts.</li></ul>

                <p>Developers at Arkane Studios in France have called on their parent company, Microsoft, to stop supporting Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza, which a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UN Special Committee</a> said was "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> published online (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>) is addressed to the "heads of Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming and the overall Microsoft group." It says that the ongoing situation in Gaza and Microsoft's work with Israel could "affect our reputation and work" and asks Microsoft to take the "appropriate measure" to resolve it. It joins the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which has set Microsoft as a priority target of its boycott. BDS specifically mentions Microsoft's gaming division and Game Pass among its boycott targets.</p><p>"We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza," the letter continues. "Moreover, we think it's our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise.</p><p>"In a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs."</p><p>The letter cites reporting from the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/" rel="nofollow ">Associated Press</a> showing Microsoft has collaborated with the Israeli military through its cloud and Azure services, as well as its AI systems that have been used to define bombing targets. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" rel="nofollow ">The Guardian</a> also found that Israel's military surveillance agency has used Azure to extensively monitor Palestinians. Microsoft denied any knowledge of this use, and said it did not "build or consult" with Israel surveillance, but has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/microsoft-israeli-military-azure-cloud-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">opened an internal investigation</a> regardling the claims.</p><p>Arkane said it is joining an existing petition from Microsoft employees called No Azure for Apartheid, which has laid out specific demands including: termination of all ongoing or future contracts with Israeli Occupation Forces, transparent disclosure of ties to the Israeli military including an independent and public audit of its contracts and services, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and free speech and safety for pro-Palestinian employees. Microsoft employees and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/microsoft-investors-prod-company-over-work-with-israeli-military?sref=uE15RiYa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shareholders</a> began pressuring Microsoft for increased transparency in spring. In May, an employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a keynote with a "Free Palestine" protest.</p><p>For its part, in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post in May</a> Microsoft claimed that it conducted both internal and external reviews and "found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." At the same time, though, it acknowledged that it does not have visibility into how customers use its software.</p><p>Since the start of the BDS boycott, the situation in Gaza has worsened. A <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">United Nations report</a> published in late July says that food security experts warn of a "worst-case scenario of famine" unfolding in the region, as "widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease" are driving an increase in hunger-related deaths. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-leader-claims-no-one-in-gaza-is-starving-data-and-witnesses-disagree" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claimed</a>, "There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza."</p><p>Arkane is the Microsoft studio behind games like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop. Its current project is an adaptation of Marvel's vampire hunter Blade, though we haven't seen much of the game yet. The studio said in 2023 that it was going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-new-blade-game-wont-be-discussed-for-a-while/1100-6519831/" data-ref-id="1100-6519831">"stay silent for a while."</a></p>
