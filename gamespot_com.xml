A cheaper way to get the game is by bundling it with the Switch 2 console, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</a> costs $500. The standalone console is priced at $450, so you're essentially saving $30 when bundled together.</p><p>Nintendo revealed heaps of other accessories for Switch 2, including an updated Switch 2 Pro Controller with new back buttons, Joy-Con that can function as a mouse, and a Charging Grip to help keep your Joy-Con juiced up for your next play session. There's also a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera built for GameChat, so you can easily connect with friends without needing the companion mobile app.</p><p>For a look at all the official Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, check out the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/accessories/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Store page</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo never considered making the Switch 2 a piece of "high-performance hardware" aimed at consumers who wanted more-powerful tech. Takuhiro Dohta from Nintendo's Entertainment Planning and Development Department made the comments in part of the company's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy Q&amp;A session</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">A Nintendo representative asked Dohta and Kouichi Kawamoto, also from the Entertainment Planning and Development Department, why the team decided to call the system the Switch 2. Kawamoto said the team toyed with the idea of calling it the Super Nintendo Switch, but in addition to Nintendo already having a system with "Super" as a descriptor--Super Nintendo--the team didn't want people to focus on the console's specifications.</p><p dir="ltr">"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p dir="ltr">Dohta expanded on Kawamoto's comments and suggested that focusing on the Switch 2's hardware improvements over the original system might alienate people who just want to play more Nintendo games.</p><p dir="ltr">"From the beginning of development, we wanted Switch 2 to be a system that can be enjoyed by a wide variety of players," Dohta said. "I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system."</p><p dir="ltr">That said, Nintendo did build the Switch 2 with more power than its predecessor. During the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo said the console will support 60fps for games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and includes HDR even in handheld mode. That's in addition to improved speakers and support for 3D audio.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, 2025</a>, for $450.

                <p>Nintendo pulled back the curtain on its anticipated Switch successor, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, during its lengthy April Nintendo Direct presentation. In addition to giving fans a closer look at the hardware itself, Nintendo confirmed that Switch 1 owners will be able to transfer their system data over to the upcoming console.</p><p>According to the company, you can move your data from the original Switch to the Switch 2 by logging in to your Nintendo Account and using the System Transfer feature. This will transfer your game saves, digital titles, user profiles, screenshots you've taken, and other data (such as your settings and parental controls) to the new console.</p><p>As detailed on the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transfer guide</a> website, you will need to have an active internet connection to perform a system transfer. Once the transfer is complete, digital Switch 1 titles you own will be automatically redownloaded on Switch 2, allowing you to pick up where you left off on the new system.</p><p>In addition to being able to transfer your games over, select Switch 1 titles such as Super Mario Odyssey, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom will receive <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates</a> on Switch 2. Nintendo will also release paid updates for some titles like Super Mario Party Jamboree and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, adding new features and functionality to the games when played on Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5 and retails for $450 USD. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders</a> for the system will begin on April 9.

The game features turn-based combat and a job system where players can mix and match different jobs and abilities to create unique party compositions.

Deltarune has historically been released chapter by chapter, and this is the first time we've heard about Chapters 3 and 4.</p><p>Deltarune Chapters 1, 2, 3, and 4 will launch with the Switch 2. Even though they were announced during the Switch 2 Direct, Chapters 3 and 4 aren't exclusives for the new Switch.

The main character Kris stars as the protagonist, surrounded by strong personalities like the bully-turned-friend Susie and mild-mannered mage, Ralsei. It launched on October 31, 2018 with a free demo of Chapter 1. Then, on September 17, 2021, Toby surprised us with Chapter 2.</p><p>"The world has been really tough for everybody recently. So I decided to release DELTARUNE Chapter 2 for free," reads the <a href="https://deltarune.com/update-092021/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deltarune September 2021 update</a>. Toby published the last Deltarune update about one year after that in September 2022.</p><p>Deltarune is an unfinished game, but fans have praised the storytelling and gameplay so far. Chapter 2 marked the discovery of an alternate route dubbed the "Snowgrave Route." Right now, it's unclear if there are more than two routes, but Chapter 3 and 4 are a great way to find out.</p><p>Deltarune will be available on June 5, 2025 as a launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
