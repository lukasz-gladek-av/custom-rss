                <p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will officially launch on October 21, co-publishers Paradox Interactive and White Wolf revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-games-and-trailers/2900-6888/" data-ref-id="2900-6888">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>. In a new trailer, players also got a closer look at the game and how parts of the storyline will see them step into the shoes of Fabien--a mysterious Malkvian detective and the voice inside of the protagonist Phyre's mind--who'll help them unravel a murder mystery that threatens to alter Seattle's secret vampire society.</p><p>Alongside the standard release, there'll be two special editions that can be preordered. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 Deluxe Edition comes bundled with Santa Monica Memories--a cosmetic pack featuring decor items inspired by the original Bloodlines game--to adorn Phyre's in-game apartment, and the Premium Edition includes that DLC and the DLC Shadows and Silk.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrAVDT7maJE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TrAVDT7maJE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This add-on allows enables players to choose the Lasombra or Toreador clans for Phyre to join, and each one offers unique abilities, playstyles, and distinct outfits. This DLC will be available as standalone purchases for the standard edition of Bloodlines 2. Preorders will also include the Bloodlines Nostalgia Jukebox, a decor item for Phyre's haven that features a curated playlist of in-game music by the composer of the first Bloodlines game, Rik Schaffer.</p><p>Bloodlines 2 arrives during a busy time on the gaming calendar, as the month includes several other big releases like Ghost of Yotei, Battlefield 6, and The Outer Worlds 2. For patient fans, the wait has been a long one, as Bloodlines 2 has had a rocky development cycle over the years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-lead-developers-replaced/1100-6487923/">The Chinese Room took over development from Hardsuit Labs in 2021</a>, and at one point, it looked like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-canceled-after-its-last-delay/1100-6497078/">Paradox was ready to pull the plug on the project</a>.</p><p>Since then, The Chinese Room has kept fans of the series updated with regular deep-dives into various facets of Bloodlines 2, like the vampire clans that you can align Phyre with, the movers and shakers in vampire city, and the penalties for breaking the Masquerade that keeps humans blissfully unaware of the bloodsuckers around them.</p>

We see the hero merchant Will setting up relics in his shop to sell to the local townspeople, followed by him setting out into a mysterious Vault in search of more relics to fill his shelves.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OCz8WarKos" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0OCz8WarKos" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The early-access version of Moonlighter 2 launching in October will offer three different biomes, with each featuring unique obstacles and enemies. Over 120 relics will be available to find and sell in Will's shop--which you can customize to your liking, including display areas, prices of relics, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">The official announcement also says that the early-access period will include nearly 100 perks, an updated combat system, and "most" of the Moonlighter 2 story. The announcement also says that the game is "nearly complete, but a few parts of the adventure still need polishing," hence the choice to enter early access first.</p><p dir="ltr">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will begin its early-access period October 23 on PC via Steam and PC Game Pass.</p>
