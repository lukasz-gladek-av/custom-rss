                <p>The open-world wizarding adventure Hogwarts Legacy is getting a Switch 2 release, and it's one of the console's launch games on June 5. The new version will include upgrades like Joy-Con 2 mouse controls, improved graphics, and shorter load times. Folks who already own the game can upgrade to the Switch 2 edition for just $10, while <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the physical Game-Key Card version</a> are available now for $60 at multiple online retailers.</p><div title="6531541 - Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3511" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531541 - Hogwarts Legacy Switch 2 Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Hogwarts Legacy - Switch 2 Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8F1SVKM?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p><span>This updated version of Hogwarts Legacy is the same open-world action RPG as the one released in 2023. However, it makes a few big upgrades thanks to the additional processing power on Switch 2. For one, it offers improved graphics and shorter load times. You’ll also benefit from crisper audio, reworked controls, and support for the Joy-Con 2 mouse sensor.</span></p>                      </div><p>Note that Hogwarts Legacy on Switch 2 comes on a Game-Key Card, which means none of the game data is on the cartridge itself, and instead it acts as physical DRM that unlocks the digital version. You'll need to download the game to your console before you can play.</p><p>As mentioned above, players who already own Hogwarts Legacy on Switch can upgrade for just $10. That means it might be worth hunting down a cheap copy of Hogwarts Legacy on Switch ahead of time, then dropping an additional $10 to upgrade to the Switch 2 version. If you want to go that route, Hogwarts Legacy is on sale for just $18 (was $60) on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/hogwarts-legacy-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch eShop</a>. Once it’s in your library, you’ll be able to upgrade to a Switch 2 copy for an extra $10--meaning you'll pay just $28 total, rather than $60.</p><p>Hogwarts Legacy takes place well before the events of Harry Potter. It sees you creating your own character and enrolling in Hogwarts. You’ll learn a variety of useful spells during your adventure, as you set out to discover a secret regarding ancient magic and a dangerous dragon. It earned positive reviews from critics and fans, and it looks like this jump to Switch 2 will be another chance for folks to live out their wizarding dreams.

Interactive Entertainment. Prior to the game's initial 2023 launch, Hogwarts Legacy was embroiled in controversy due to transphobic remarks from Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Although she was not personally involved with its development, she stands to profit from its success.
