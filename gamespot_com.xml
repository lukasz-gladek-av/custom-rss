                <p>BioShock fans may be understandably curious about the fate of the next game in the series following leaks that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-remake-cancelled-as-bioshock-4-reportedly-fails-a-review/1100-6533650/" data-ref-id="1100-6533650">BioShock 4 failed an internal review</a> and Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore was reportedly ousted by 2K Games as a result. However, Strauss Zelnick--the CEO of 2K Games' parent company, Take-Two Interactive--has essentially promised fans that BioShock 4 is still on the way and it won't be canceled.</p><p>"It's going to come out," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-4-is-going-to-come-out-take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-promises-that-i-can-say-hand-on-heart-without-question" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That I can say hand on heart, without question ... We don't talk about how long our development cycles are. We have had some ups and downs along the way. That is accurate. And we have had changes in studio leadership. That said, we have very big shoes to fill on BioShock because of the legacy of Ken Levine, the legacy of what has gone before, which has been so successful. And we need to make sure that this experience is true to the BioShock DNA on the one hand, and a massive step forward on the other hand. That's always challenging. We think we're up to the challenge, but it has not been seamless."</p><p>The same report that noted BioShock 4's latest setback also indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioshock-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6530162/" data-ref-id="1100-6530162">a remake of the original BioShock was canceled</a> earlier this year. 2K Games acknowledged the original report and called Cloud Chamber's BioShock 4 "good game," but reiterated its commitment "to delivering a great one."</p><p>There hasn't been a new game in the BioShock series since 2013's BioShock Infinite, and a proposed BioShock movie has also had difficulty breaking out of development. Francis Lawrence is attached to direct BioShock at Netflix, and he recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-tricky-bioshock-movie-is-not-dead-brings-on-a-new-writer/1100-6531560/" data-ref-id="1100-6531560">a new draft of the film has been written</a> by Terminator: Dark Fate scribe Justin Rhodes.</p><p>As for BioShock creator Ken Levine, his next title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/judas/" data-ref-id="5000-577619">Judas</a>, remains in development at Ghost Story and it will eventually be published by Take-Two. However, a release date for Judas has yet to be announced.</p>

                <p>This year's Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Studios in California and Universal Orlando in Florida will feature haunted houses devoted to Fallout and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-nights-at-freddys-universal-halloween-horror-nights-teaser-features-some-familiar-faces/1100-6533541/" data-ref-id="1100-6533541">Five Nights At Freddy's</a>--and while both are inspired by video games, both houses will lean into their respective live-action adaptations.</p><p>The theme parks haven't shared any of the footage of this year's HHN houses yet, but the creative team on both coasts has offered a few teasers about what fans can expect to see.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/halloween-horror-nights-houses-fallout-terrifier-five-nights-at-freddys-1236339724/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Universal revealed that Amazon Prime's Fallout series provided the HHN team with 3D models of Walton Goggins' The Ghoul to ensure that masks used in the attraction are identical to his face on the show. Universal Orlando's Lora Sauls also said that a teaser has been filmed, with "one of their characters for us to tease their second season in the house."</p><p>Universal Orlando's Mike Aiello added that the Fallout house will be a montage of different locations from the show and the games, with appearances by Lucy (played by Ella Purnell in the series), The Ghoul, Maximus (played by Aaron Moten in the series), and a 500-pound animatronic bear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPC6syuNU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OWPC6syuNU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking of animatronics, the Five Nights At Freddy's house will feature full-size animatronic recreations of Freddy Fazbear and his pals as created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Universal Hollywood's John Murdy called them "the most complicated animatronic figures that weâ€™ve ever done" for HHN. He added that guests will "see a fully animated Freddy Fazbear performing like he would in the movie or the video game" in a convincing recreation of the pizzeria that serves as the setting for the games and movies. Even the game's famous security room will be a part of the attraction.</p><p>Universal Orlando will kick off the Halloween festivities with Five Nights At Freddy's on August 29, while Universal Studios will wait a little longer and start the FNAF event on September 4. Halloween Horror Nights on both coasts will run until November 2.</p>
