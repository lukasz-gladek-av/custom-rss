                <p>It was anything but a wonderful holiday season for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-285282">Ubisoft's Rainbow Six Siege</a> players. Following a massive hack that dumped billions of credits into the community, Ubisoft had to shut down the marketplace and roll back accounts. The fixes aren't entirely in place, but Ubisoft is now offering compensation to its players.</p><p>On <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2011166360894582975" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Ubisoft announced that any Rainbow Six Siege players who log in between January 16-25 will receive the following gifts.</p><ul><li>4x battle pass XP</li><li>Ten battle pass levels</li><li>Missed daily rewards (Delta Pack, Alpha Pack, Auric Mold skin for the P-10C)</li></ul><p>According to Ubisoft's update, account rollbacks are still in progress and the marketplace won't return until a later date in Year 11.</p><p>The most common response to this message on X were questions about when the voice chat feature will be restored. Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2011448577839554884" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied</a>, "Voice chat continues to be a key priority for the team moving forward."</p><p>A separate Rainbow Six Siege X hack occurred earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-players-hit-with-67-day-ban-after-another-apparent-hack/1100-6537180/" data-ref-id="1100-6537180">indiscriminately banned players</a> for 67 days in a reference to the 6-7 meme.</p><p>Last year, Rainbow Six Siege's transition to Siege X brought <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-gets-huge-bump-in-players-after-siege-x-launch/1100-6532352/" data-ref-id="1100-6532352">a lot of players back to the game</a> a decade after its launch. It's been so successful that creative director Alexander Karpazis told GameSpot there's no immediate reason <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-expect-rainbow-six-siege-2-creative-director-explains-why-its-not-happening-yet/1100-6536724/" data-ref-id="1100-6536724">for Ubisoft to move forward with Rainbow Six Siege 2</a>.</p><p>Former Rainbow Six Siege creative director <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-players-hit-with-67-day-ban-after-another-apparent-hack/1100-6537180/" data-ref-id="1100-6537180">Xavier Marquis recently returned to Ubisoft</a>, but not to the franchise. Instead, Marquis will be working on a new 4v4 tactical multiplayer free-to-play game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/march-of-giants/" data-ref-id="5000-692488">March of Giants</a>.</p>

                <p>Just as the NFL playoffs heat up, Nintendo has announced that Madden NFL 26 will be available to try for free from January 15 through January 21 for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p><p>It's the full game, not a limited slice of it, that Switch 2 owners can play for the duration of the free period. All save data will carry forward if players buy the full game. Additionally, Madden NFL 26 is 60% off through January 25, bringing the price down from $70 to $28.</p><h2><strong>Madden NFL 26 free on Switch 2 times</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Starts:</strong> January 15 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET</li><li><strong>Ends:</strong> January 21 at 11:59 PM PT / 2:59 AM ET (January 22)</li></ul><p>Madden NFL 26 launched in August 2025 and has sold very well. It's the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 6 best-selling game of 2025 in the US</a>, and it's no longer the only football game from EA, as the company revived its college football series in 2024. The latter series isn't released on Switch or Switch 2, however.</p><p>The Divisional round of the NFL playoffs begins this Saturday and run through Sunday, before the Conference Championships the following weekend. There will be a week off, and then Super Bowl LX takes place on Sunday, February 8 at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California.</p>
