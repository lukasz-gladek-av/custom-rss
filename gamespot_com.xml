                <p dir="ltr">The unique hook to the anime horse girls of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is that the characters are each based on actual famous race horses. With the sports sim's surging popularity in North America, this may be seeing an interest among new fans to visit the real horses themselves. With that in mind, the game's developer Cygames has <a href="https://umamusume.com/news/200003/" rel="nofollow ">published</a> guidelines for people wishing to visit stables.</p><p dir="ltr">Umamusume: Pretty Derby has already been a hit in Japan since the original mobile release in 2021, spawning manga, anime, and even a stage adaptation. But since its global release last month, strong word of mouth, including streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce, has helped catapult it to widespread attention, where earlier this week it hit its all-time-peak of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/">just over 50,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That seems to have also prompted more enquiries from fans who want to actually visit the real-life race horses the titular Umamusume are based on, as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" rel="nofollow ">BlueSky user</a> has noted that appointments to visit Haru Urara, a race horse beloved for her long losing streak, has already been booked out for the month. Their post also included a screenshot from a Twitter user urging fans to "please be respectful and follow the rules".</p><p dir="ltr">Those rules are now available on the Umamasume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>, and they advise prospective visitors to contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center rather than the stables directly for a visit. It also warns, "Horses are extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Even what seems like a small change to a person could be a shocking, scary, or stressful event to them. For the safety and well-being of the horses, we ask all Umamusume fans to follow all rules and practice good etiquette when visiting stables in Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">The guidance is only for when visiting stables in Japan, but fans are advised to check local resources for information and rules if they wish to visit stables outside of Japan.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4's roster was first revealed, one notable name was conspicuous in its absence: Bam Margera, one of the most famous skaters of the era who appeared in multiple Tony Hawk games, was the only one from THPS 3's original roster missing from the remake. Margera was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bam-margera-officially-returning-for-tony-hawk-pro-skater-34/1100-6531423/">eventually added to the game</a> in the 11th hour, and in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/the-return-of-bam-margera-iconic-skate-star-talks-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-thug-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">new interview with VGC</a>, Margera says a chance encounter with Tony Hawk in Los Angeles is the reason he's back in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Margera says that he was in LA at a time where he hadn't spoken with Hawk in about a year, when Margera "wasn’t doing too good." After a phone call and an invitation to the Hawk's Nest skate park, Margera says Hawk was impressed with his progress.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uxow97z1h_U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Uxow97z1h_U" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I grabbed my skateboard, put on some knee pads, and we wound up ollieing over each other on the big channel," Margera said in the interview. "He’s like, 'What is going on? You are back.'" Margera explains that he recently married a stretch coach who has helped him improve his physical health, which has allowed him to return to skateboarding full-time.</p><p dir="ltr">"He was pretty blown away by that," Margera said. "And I think that, you know, really provoked him to make a call to Activision, knowing that there was already a deadline, but to see what kind of strings he could pull to get me back in it. Just from that special little visit."</p><p dir="ltr">Bam Margera joins a Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 roster that also includes a mixture of new and legendary skaters, with names like Zion Wright, Margie Didal, Bob Burnquist, and Tony Hawk himself included in the mix. A few guests also appear as playable skaters, including the Doom Slayer from id Software's first-person shooter Doom and Michaelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is out now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

                <p>While it might be tempting to immediately load up Road to Glory or Dynasty when you first download <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, going to the settings menu is the best decision you can make. This allows you to customize every gameplay option in the game and learn about some of the new features that EA has added this year. One of the most important sections of the settings menu in College Football 26 is called "Passing Mechanics," and you'll want to ensure you pick the right options here.</p><p>These settings determine nearly everything about how passing works in CFB 26. However, some of the settings can be a little confusing, so we're going to break down the best Passing Mechanics to use.</p><h2>Best Passing Mechanics in College Football 26</h2><p>To get to the Passing Mechanics settings, all you have to do is load up the main menu of CFB 26 and look at the tab bar at the top of the screen. Here, you'll see the "Settings" tab near the end of the list. Scroll to Settings and then select "Gameplay Settings." In the Settings menu, scroll down in the "Game Options" tab until you reach Passing Mechanics.</p><p>As you'll see, there are a few different passing settings to tinker with, with the most important being "Passing Type." This setting can completely change how passing works in CFB 26, so you'll want to understand which one you're picking.</p><p>If you want a rundown of the best Passing Mechanics settings to select, take a look below:</p><ul><li><strong>Passing Type</strong>: Placement &amp; Accuracy</li><li><strong>Passing Slowdown</strong>: Off</li><li><strong>Pass Lead Increase</strong>: Small</li><li><strong>Reticle Speed</strong>: 12-14</li><li><strong>Reticle Visibility</strong>: User Only</li><li><strong>Meter Visibility</strong>: User Only</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530022"></a><figcaption>The Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530022-img_6840.jpg"></figure><p>For starters, the <strong>Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to be the best overall Passing Type</strong> you can use in CFB 26. The other options are: Placement, Classic Passing, and Revamped Passing. By default, you'll have Revamped Passing selected, which is a new spin on Classic Passing that allows for more control over the arc of passes. If you have an accurate quarterback, you can more accurately place balls where a receiver needs them to be to make a catch.</p><p>While you can stick with the shiny new Revamped Passing setting, Placement &amp; Accuracy is going to give you the most precision when it comes to throwing the ball. This adds a timing element to passing that allows you to make perfectly accurate passes on bullet passes. You'll also see some visual aids on screen that make it simpler to control a ball's placement and power. Placement &amp; Accuracy makes it easy to throw every kind of pass in CFB 26 as long as you understand how to use it correctly. If you want a new experience compared to CFB 25, though, you can stick with Revamped Passing and learn the new form of passing that EA's introduced.</p><p>Moving on, <strong>Passing Slowdown should always remain off</strong>, as there's no real need to have a slowdown during a pass. You'll also want <strong>Pass Lead Increase set to "small."</strong> What this does is give you a smaller window to lead receivers, which is what you want. You don't want to lead receivers too much when throwing a pass, as this can result in the ball getting outside their catch radius. If that happens, the pass will either fall incomplete or head the other way in a defender's hands.</p><p>Finally, the <strong>Reticle Speed option</strong> is a personal preference: We found the <strong>12-14 range to be a sweet spot</strong>. However, if you want the reticle to move slower or faster, you can adjust it accordingly. The last two settings, <strong>Reticle Visibility</strong> and <strong>Meter Visibility</strong>, don't matter much; you can just leave them set to User Only.</p><p>That does it for the Passing Mechanics settings in CFB 26. There's not much to them, but subtle changes can have a massive impact on your gameplay. Now that you've covered those settings, make sure to check out our guides on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">best offensive playbooks</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-defensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533086/" data-ref-id="1100-6533086">best defensive playbooks</a> in CFB 26.</p>
