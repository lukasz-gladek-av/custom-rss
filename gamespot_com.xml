                <p>A lot of Fortnite's most memorable moments have come from the game's live events, where everybody playing is experiencing some kind of one-time-only content that you just had to be there for. The very first Fortnite live event, the one that started this whole awesome tradition, was the Blast Off event at the end of Chapter 1 Season 4--and, hey, guess what, it's coming for the end of Fortnite OG Season 4. The new version of this rocket party will go down on July 26 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET during any ongoing rounds of Fortnite OG. Check out the teaser.</p><p>The Blast Off event originally took place on June 30, 2018, when the mysterious Visitor launched a rocket that went haywire right in the middle of the battle royale matches that were going on at 10:30 AM PT that morning. The rocket took off, flew way out into space, then turned around and flew in toward toward Tilted Towers. But instead of landing, the rocket hit a rift--and that's when things got <em>really</em> interesting. You can watch the original version of the event in its entirety below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFB7k586Jm4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZFB7k586Jm4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not expected that the Fortnite OG version will be very different than it was when it first happened, but it also wouldn't be surprising if Epic threw in some new wrinkles, like a safe zone where players can watch the event without being threatened by other players.</p><p>The arrival of the Visitor on the Battle Royale island back in Chapter 1 Season 4 marked the beginning of Fortnite's story, though the plotline with the Seven--the Avengers-style group the Visitor belonged to--was largely discarded during Chapter 4. There's been some hope among folks who care about the story that the new version of the Blast Off event could contain some new detail that might tie it in with the current Fortnite plot.</p><p>Whatever the situation ends up being, the event will serve as the beginning of the end of Fortnite OG Season 4, which closes on August 7.</p>

<p dir="ltr">No other details about the game are known aside from its reported codename: FMC. While that doesn't seem like much, as noted by mp1st, the codename may give fans an idea of what could be coming next. The codenames for previous Dark Souls games and the more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon/" data-ref-id="5000-577631">Armored Core 6</a> both featured the letter "F" as part of their internal codenames, while games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> used the codename GR. From Software's latest game, the standalone multiplayer spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, used the internal codename CL.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not a lot to go on. However, based on the codenames, the report speculates that the project doesn't seem to be DLC for any existing From Software game, as the developer typically uses the same codenames in the files for DLC as in the base game. Since it's also reportedly multiplatform in nature, the codename also isn't believed to be referring to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-announces-the-duskbloods-a-new-rpg-exclusive-to-switch-2/1100-6530560/" data-ref-id="1100-6530560">The Duskbloods, From Software's multiplayer-focused Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</a> slated for next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on the codenames for previous games, that leaves the Dark Souls and Armored Core franchises as strong contenders for the project. While it could potentially be a new entry in either series, there's also a strong chance, as noted by mp1st, that it could be a remake or remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-438502">Dark Souls 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">From Software is certainly keeping busy, having released Armored Core 6 in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review-kill-them-with-kindness/1900-6418243/" data-ref-id="1900-6418243">Elden Ring's Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> last year, and Elden Ring: Nightreign back in May. It announced it was working on The Duskbloods in April as part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Nintendo Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">News that another From Software game is coming soon may put some fans at ease given the studio's recent pivot into multiplayer-focused games. However, From Software boss and Duskbloods director Hidetaka <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said the studio is not abandoning single-player games</a>, and that it will continue to make games that "embrace our more traditional style."</p>

Essentially a user-friendly version of Blender, players are able to sculpt in 3D, producing incredible works of art--or pure nightmare fuel--that have been chiseled to perfection.</p><p>This is meant to be a creative diversion from DK's new adventure, and some of the creations that people have gleefully uploaded to their social media accounts are best described as creative or cursed--sometimes, both--and they're all <em>excellent</em>.</p><p>Some of the creations glimpsed below include Five Nights at Freddy's fanart, an unflattering portrait of US VP JD Vance, and a version of DK that can see into the very depths of your soul. All of them look like they could easily replace the Mona Lisa at The Louvre, and at the very least, they deserve their own wing at that art museum.</p><p>People are really making the most of this mode, as the Joy-Con 2 mouse controls offer a high level of precision. Accessing Artist Mode is also easy, as it's available from the main menu of Donkey Kong Bananza.</p><p>Donkey Kong Bananza has earned critical acclaim since it launched this week, as it's not only one of the best games of the year, but a must-play Switch 2 title as well. Looking ahead, Nintendo will continue to expand the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Switch 2 library</a> with several highly anticipated games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-launches-in-october-nintendo-switch-2-edition-detailed/1100-6531855/" data-ref-id="1100-6531855">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> alongside dozens of third-party releases.</p>

So far, the puzzle title only supports English as players use emoji to finish phrases with short clues. For example, there is a mystery two-word phrase with "departure" as the clue (which can be expanded, though it costs a move). The solution requires dragging over the sunrise and clock emoji for "early," followed by car and keys emoji for "start." These emoji also have to be selected from a larger group, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492" data-ratio="1.02394106814" data-width="1086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492"></a><figcaption>The Emoji Game is now available as part of an Apple News+ subscription, joining other puzzle titles like Crossword Mini and Quartiles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Emoji Game is the perfect addition to the Apple News+ suite of word and number puzzles, turning the emoji we use every day into a brainteaser that's approachable and fun," said Apple News editor-in-chief Lauren Kern.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-spelling-game-comes-to-apple-news-plus-with-ios-17-5-update/1100-6523464/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/">debuted Quartiles on Apple News+</a>, a spelling game where players create words by combining two- to four-letter tiles.

                <p>Valve's ubiquitous PC gaming storefront, Steam, may soon experience a purging of its adult content after a significant change to its guidelines this week.</p><p>In a quiet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update to its terms</a>, Valve has now provided that, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult-only content" should not be published on Steam.</p><p>The move, which invites banks and similar institutions to exercise an unprecedented degree of power in the kind of content that goes up on Steam, seems to have been made to appease the payment processors that work with Valve. This tactic, while relatively new to games, has been used in the past to go after porn and sex work sites like OnlyFans.</p><p>This change to Steam's guidelines has already brought down several games from the store. In a response to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>, Valve claimed that it was already notified of certain games violating the new standards set in place by its payment processors, saying, "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam. We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future."</p><p>This shift in policy comes as multiple digital storefronts, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">Nintendo eShop</a> and Steam, begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking down</a> on a glut of content that's been dubbed "slop" of late. Many of these titles, which seem to blatantly infringe on the aesthetics and naming conventions of existing popular games and feature sexual (see: adult) content, have popped up in great number over the last several months. Many believe these games are largely made by developers capitalizing on generative AI and large-language models to quickly produce content masquerading as the games they're ripping off.</p><p>However, the language used in the update leaves many factors unclear and open to a potentially disastrous amount of interpretation. For example, it is never clarified what "kinds of adult-only content" will not be permissible on Steam now. Moreover, the updated guidelines stress that these payment processors are enforcing new rules that should be adhered, but never makes clear exactly what the new standards of these companies are.</p><p>Despite the fact that a lot of these "slop" games lead with sexual content, there are also plenty of developers making adult-only games that touch on similar subjects. Following these changes, there are now many developers at risk of being penalized or being removed from one of the largest digital gaming storefronts.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has made a major change to what you can buy on your Xbox or through the Windows web store. As of today, July 18, Microsoft is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/games-apps/apps-help/troubleshoot-movies-and-tv-on-xbox-one" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">no longer</a> offering movies or TV shows to buy or rent.</p><p>Anything you previously bought can still be viewed through the Movies &amp; TV app, but Microsoft has removed the ability to purchase anything more. US members can sign up for <a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movies Anywhere</a> to continue watching "select" purchased content elsewhere. </p><p>If this news is upsetting and you want a refund, that's not possible, as Microsoft said its terms specify that movies and TV shows are not eligible for refunds.</p><p>Microsoft did not say why this is happening, but its FAQ about the shutdown mentions that Xbox and Microsoft Store users can buy and rent movie and TV programming through a variety of other sources, including Prime Video, Fandango at Home, Apple TV, and others.</p><p>The Movies &amp; TV app debuted in 2012 when it was known as Xbox Video. The Movies &amp; TV app for Xbox 360 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-is-closing-but-dont-get-too-worried/1100-6516956/" data-ref-id="1100-6516956">closed at the end of July 2024.</a></p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft recently made headlines for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">latest round of mass layoffs that led to game cancellations and at least one studio closure.</a> At the same time, Microsoft is pressing ahead with a new console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">recently announcing a partnership with AMD for this.</a></p>
