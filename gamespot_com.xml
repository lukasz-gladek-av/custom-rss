                <p>Sequels are hallmark of the video game industry, but no one should expect Diablo 5 anytime soon. Blizzard's Rod Fergusson said in an interview that the studio intends for Diablo 4 to stick around "for years" to come.</p><p>Diablo 4 is embracing a sort-of live-service approach with plans for yearly expansions--however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">2025's expansion is now coming in 2026</a>. In any event, Blizzard intends to continue to support Diablo 4 as opposed to moving on right away to a potential sequel.</p><p>"I don't know if it's eternal. I think Destiny tried and did that like, 'This is a ten-year game,' and then they quickly were not," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whens-the-right-time-for-diablo-5-blizzards-rod-fergusson-wants-diablo-4-to-be-around-for-years-i-dont-know-if-its-eternal" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fergusson told IGN</a>. "We want people to see the road ahead, because we know that, to play a Diablo game, you're probably putting hundreds of hours in and we want people to know that we're respecting their time and that we're not just here and gone."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="81597930" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p> Over a decade ago, Skype was one of the big features that Microsoft boasted about for Xbox One--which the company coined the "all in one experience." Today, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/02/28/the-next-chapter-moving-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams/">Microsoft has announced plans</a> to shut down the video-conferencing app entirely in May, with the ability to transfer data over to Teams.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2013, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2013/05/22/xbox-reveal-skype-blog/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Skype was going to be one of the ways the Xbox One stood out</a> in the gaming industry, letting you video chat while playing Titanfall and watching TV with Snap. Remember Snap? It was the feature that put secondary applications on the right side of the screen for Xbox One.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Skype worked with voice controls, as Microsoft touted saying things like, "Hey Xbox, Skype Mom!" This was possible as the system was initially bundled with Kinect for Xbox One. On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM">YouTube</a>, Skype even marketed the features with a silly promo video featuring comedian Bobby Lee.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk-a_Pj4uHM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lk-a_Pj4uHM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Since then, Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer has admitted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/">the entertainment-focused approach to Xbox One was a mistake</a> and ultimately led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-one-sales-were-less-than-half-of-the-ps4/1100-6506476/">PS4 dominating Xbox One last generation in hardware sales</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It seems as though a Skype app was available on Xbox Series X|S but pulled from the Xbox Store in the past couple of years, per <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/13vwz5c/did_they_remove_skype_from_xbox/?rdt=47026" rel="nofollow ">this Reddit post</a>. Keep in mind Kinect doesn't work in any capacity with Xbox Series X|S, either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-to-acquire-skype-for-85-billion/1100-6312959/" data-ref-id="1100-6312959">Microsoft acquired Skype for $8.5 billion</a> in early 2013.

The game's director has now responded, saying the studio has not modified Ciri's look and attempted to explain why her character model in the behind-the-scenes video may appear to look different from the trailer itself.</p><p>"The behind-the-scenes video features the same in-game model of Ciri as seen in the original trailer. We have not modified it," <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1895148428176375925" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sebastian Kalemba said</a>. "What you're seeing is raw footage--without facial animation, lighting, or virtual camera lenses."</p><p>Kalemba also assured fans that the newly released footage in the behind-the-scenes video represents a "work-in-progress snapshot" of Ciri's look.</p><p>"This variation is a natural part of the game development process. At this point, any character's appearance may vary depending on the medium--whether it's in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game," he said.</p><p>After the original Witcher trilogy focused on Geralt, The Witcher 4 tells its story from the perspective of Ciri. Kalemba previously talked about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">Ciri was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4.</a></p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake.</a> The Witcher 4, like CD Projekt's other games, is being made using Epic's Unreal Engine 5 following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-cd-projekt-red-explains-why-its-using-unreal-engine-5/1100-6502196/" data-ref-id="1100-6502196">CD Projekt and Epic striking a major development deal. </a></p>

                <p>Today is the release date for Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and fans aren't the only ones who want to get their hands on it. Pocketpair, the developer of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-breed-pals-guide/1100-6520645/" data-ref-id="1100-6520645">Palworld</a>, is declaring today a special day off just to let its employees dive into Monster Hunter Wilds.</p><p>Via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Pocketpair wrote on social media that it had received word from several of its employees that they might be feeling sick on the last day of the month, which just so happened to be the day of Monster Hunter Wilds' release. Instead of insisting that employees show up as scheduled, Pocketpair gave them a holiday.</p><p>Palworld's community manager, Bucky, subsequently <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1895239908031373790" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed that this is what happened</a>. It's a very nice gesture, and probably well-deserved. Pocketpair's dev team has a lot of work ahead of then, as laid out in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-roadmap-includes-lots-of-exciting-new-features-including-co-op-cross-play/1100-6528896/" data-ref-id="1100-6528896">roadmap of updates coming to Palworld</a> in its second year. Some of the game's upcoming features include co-op cross-play, new pals, and new endgame content. Thanks to the team's ongoing efforts, Palworld recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-massive-new-player-milestone-year-2-promised-to-be-even-better/1100-6529574/" data-ref-id="1100-6529574">crossed a milestone with 32 million players</a> from across the globe in the game's first year.</p><p>Outside of the game itself, Pocketworld still has to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">deal with the lawsuit filed by Nintendo and The Pokemon Company in Japan</a> over a small handful of patent infringement claims. Although that case has yet to be resolved, Pocketworld recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-launches-new-game-on-switch-in-middle-of-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6528719/" data-ref-id="1100-6528719">released Overdungeon on Switch</a>.</p><p>As for Monster Hunter Wilds, Capcom has already shared details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-post-launch-update-already-revealed/1100-6529474/" data-ref-id="1100-6529474">the first big post-launch update</a>.
