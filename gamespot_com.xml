                <p>One gameplay staple of extraction shooters is the regular "wipe" that resets everyone's in-game progress back to square one. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/news/">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios knows that this system can be controversial, and to keep things fair, the studio aims to make wipes a voluntary feature of the game through its Expedition Projects.</p><p>Players will unlock an Expedition Project at level 20. Each Expedition cycle runs for roughly eight weeks and players will contribute toward overall progress. Once the Expedition is complete, they'll have the option to reset their progress and lose all gained levels, skills, and their inventory, while their cosmetics and achievements will remain. Players who do not complete an Expedition can instead carry their progress over to the next cycle.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders | Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Ideally, this will keep things balanced for everyone. Players who don't have as much time to commit to playing Arc Raiders won't have to worry about booting up the game and discovering that they've lost all their progress, while dedicated players will be rewarded with unique cosmetic rewards, permanent account unlocks, and buffs that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle.</p><p>Design director Virgil added that players who gain these benefits will not have a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset. It's all about bragging rights, as expressed through the cosmetics they'll earn. "It's not a silver bullet, and [it] won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" rel="nofollow ">Virgil wrote</a>.</p><p>Arc Raiders launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Ahead of its arrival, Embark Studios will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-having-one-more-stress-test-before-launch-and-itll-be-open-to-everyone/1100-6534921/">Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC and console</a>, and while progress won't carry over to the full game, participation will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for use in the full game.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tavern-keeper/">Tavern Keeper</a> developer Greenheart Games has officially announced that its fantasy-themed business simulator will be launching in Steam Early Access on November 3. A follow-up to Game Dev Tycoon, Greenheart Games is celebrating the development milestone with a new trailer for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/" rel="nofollow ">and an updated demo</a> that has gone live ahead of the October edition of Steam Next Fest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjqNMKF13q4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IjqNMKF13q4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Similar to management games like Two-Point Hospital, Tavern Keeper is all about running your very own inn and dealing with the challenges of the service industry within its fantasy setting. The game mixes light humor with an in-depth simulation mode that allows you to tweak your establishment's design to a high degree, as well as detailed decorative elements in its sandbox mode that allow you to create everything from bustling taprooms to relaxing reading corners.</p><p>Tavern Keeper also offers a campaign narrated by English actor Steven Pacey, and this part of the game will see players build taverns across several varied challenges. Each region will offer its own challenges, fantasy cultures, and stories.</p><p>As mentioned above, Steam Next Fest kicks off on October 13. This new edition of the week-long event will once again offer demos for unreleased games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-the-next-steam-sale-date/1100-6532422/" data-ref-id="1100-6532422">Other big Steam promotions</a> scheduled for this year include Steam Scream (October 27 - November 3), Animal Fest (November 10-17), Sports Fest (December 8-15), and the Steam Winter Sale will start on December 18.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts has been implementing AI technologies in its development cycles for years, and while EA says there is no content in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">Battlefield 6</a> made using generative AI, the technology is "very seducing," according to DICE GM Rebecka Coutaz.</p><p>She told <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BBC Newsbeat</a> that EA's teams use genAI in the early stages of development "to allow more time and more space to be creative." But Battlefield 6 has no genAI-created content. She is optimistic about the technology overall, though. "If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative," she said.</p><p>Another Battlefield 6 developer, Fasahat "Fas" Salim, told the site that genAI is "not anything to be scared of" in the video game industry and that teams are now working on figuring out how to best implement the technology into future development pipelines.</p><p>"It's just a matter of how we can incorporate that productively into our workflows; how can we leverage that to take our games to the next level," he said.</p><p>To hear EA developers speak enthusiastically about AI is no big surprise, as the company's other key executives, including CEO Andrew Wilson, have said the tools will help EA in the long run. Wilson has said further adoption of AI technologies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">will lead to job losses, but it will ultimately create more jobs than it displaces over time.</a></p><p>Before this, EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a> Outside of EA, Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">Battlefield 6 launches today, October 10</a>, for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.
