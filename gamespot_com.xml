                <p dir="ltr">Tony Todd died last week at the age of 69. While probably best known for his movie appearances in the Candyman and Final Destination franchises, the actor also has voiced some big roles in video games the past few years--such as Venom in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-2-review-web-warriors/1900-6418134/" data-ref-id="1900-6418134">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Insomniac Games paid tribute to Todd over the weekend, posting a statement <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1855085273035530368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> noting the team was "heartbroken" by his death. "He brought so much joy to our studio during the production of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and to many fans around the world with his inimitable voice and presence. We are Venom... forever," said Insomniac.</p><p dir="ltr">Spider-Man 2 saw the introduction of the symbiote, portrayed by Todd. Last year, the actor showed up with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-gets-comic-con-panel-this-month-with-a-bunch-of-big-names/1100-6515752/" data-ref-id="1100-6515752">big names from Spider-Man 2 for a Comic-Con panel called "Symbiotic Relationships."</a> Todd also told <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/marvels-spider-man-2-venom-tony-todd-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel.com</a> before the game launched that "Venom is one of the coolest Marvel characters ever created." Last month, Insomniac revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-comes-to-pc-in-january/1100-6527271/" data-ref-id="1100-6527271">Spider-Man 2 will arrive on PC on January 30</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Todd will also be featured in next month's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

It was truly awe-inspiring getting the opportunity to know and work with him."</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Todd also voiced roles in Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, Half-Life: Alyx, and Back 4 Blood as Doctor Rogers. Meanwhile, his film career spanned decades, showing up in Platoon, The Rock, and 2021's Candyman.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/machinegames/status/1855317325584449952" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We had the great privilege of working with Tony Todd and will miss him dearly.
