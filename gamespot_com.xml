                <p>Inin Games and Ys Net have announced that they received the publishing rights for Shenmue 3 from the game's previous publisher, Deep Silver. Inin Games has also teased more plans for Shenmue 3.</p><p>"Inin Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue 3 into its next phase," they said in a statement. "This collaboration marks the beginning of a new chapter for Shenmue 3, with Inin Games working closely alongside Ys Net to honor the series' legacy while ensuring its accessibility to even more fans around the world."</p><p>It's unclear what plans Inin Games and Ys Net have in store for Shenmue 3, but it's possible that it could come to additional platforms such as Xbox and Switch. The game has been a console exclusive for PlayStation since 2019, as Sony helped fund the game.</p><p>In 2022, Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki said that he'd make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-creator-yu-suzuki-wants-to-make-shenmue-4-more-approachable-if-it-happens/1100-6503038/" data-ref-id="1100-6503038">Shenmue 4 more approachable</a> if given the chance to develop it. Although Shenmue 3 ends on a cliffhanger, he explained that a follow-up could tell a story completely separate from the events of that game. Earlier this year, Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">bought a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard</a> to campaign for a Shenmue 4, which managed to briefly get Shenmue trending on Twitter.</p><p>Shenmue 3 is currently available on PS4 and PC. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shenmue-3-review-from-a-forgotten-time/1900-6417374/" data-ref-id="1900-6417374">Shenmue 3 review</a>, we said, "Unfortunately, while it's fascinating as a weird curiosity from a long-gone era of gaming, it's simply not that fun to actually play."</p>

                <p>Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks is ready to get work and play. A Microsoft veteran who joined Hasbro in 2016 as president of its Wizards of the Coast division--which includes Magic: The Gathering and all things Dungeons and Dragons--and wants to double down on bringing those worlds to the hands of video game players with new Magic and D&amp;D games in the works. </p><p>Cocks took the reins of the company in 2022 and saw an initial boom under his leadership during the pandemic, but as kids went back to school, sales slumped, and the company issued over 1,000 layoffs since. Hasbro had previously dedicated $1 billion to video game development. Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> about this focus, Cocks indicated that $100-$150 million a year would be spent on games like Exodus, which will be developed by BioWare. </p><p>"We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands," Cocks explained. The CEO also confirmed that Hasbro was developing its own D&amp;D video game as well as the Wizards branch working on a video game focused on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/boost-your-magic-the-gathering-collection-with-these-early-black-friday-discounts/1100-6527839/" data-ref-id="1100-6527839">Commander format for Magic: The Gathering</a>. That's on top of a GI Joe action-adventure game that's already in pre-production.</p><p>D&amp;D games are nothing new with TSR working with Black Isle Studios and BioWare more than 25 years ago on the first Baldur's Gate game, which was set in the Forgotten Realms campaign and used the 2.5 Edition rules. There was even a video game for the Intellivision by Mattel. However, with the white-hot popularity of last year's Baldur's Gate 3, taking another stab at the franchise seems like a logical solution.</p><p>"What makes Magic so successful is what will drive Hasbro's future success," Cocks added. "It's grounded in play."</p><p>Cocks oversaw the sales growth of Magic leap to $1.4 billion between 2019 and 2023. That number has been attributed to Cocks' love for the game as he introduced new card packs for Magic and an online video game version called Magic: The Gathering Arena. He wants Hasbro to find a way to add more digital collectability to Magic, similar to Marvel Snap or, the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/#16" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Game Award nominee for Best Mobile Game</a>, Pokemon TCG Pocket.</p><p>No information about either game was revealed, and with Larian Studios winding down its Baldur's Gate 3 work, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-teases-next-game-and-discusses-decision-to-not-make-baldurs-gate-4/1100-6522165/" data-ref-id="1100-6522165">the decision to not continue with Baldur's Gate 4</a>, the possibilities feel limitless as to what these new games could look and play like.</p>

GameSpot reviewer Richard Wakeling said the game's "torrent of technical issues" ultimately hampers the game's oppressive atmosphere.

                <p>Activision has revealed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 players can get a nice bonus in Call of Duty: Warzone. A new trailer called "Maximize Your Gameplay" confirms the people who buy Black Ops 6 receive a 30% XP boost in the free-to-play battle-royale title. GameSpot understands that people who play through Game Pass can also get the XP boost.</p><p>The fine print in the trailer specifies that the 30% XP boost is only available during the seasonal content for Black Ops 6, which suggests it'll end in time for 2025's inevitable Call of Duty game. Still, the 30% XP boost should last for nearly a year, which is a nice perk if you want to spend $70 to buy the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BW01Rr3rMDw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BW01Rr3rMDw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other XP news, the legacy double XP tokens that were removed from Black Ops 6 have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-reveal-return-of-legacy-xp-tokens/1100-6527868/" data-ref-id="1100-6527868">reinstated</a>, and that's good news for people hoping to level up faster.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/">Season 1 of Call of Duty</a> continues to add new content to the game, with Ranked Play mode arriving to multiplayer on November 21.
