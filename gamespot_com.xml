                <p>Geoff Keighley has confirmed that the next Summer Game Fest showcase will take place on June 6.</p><p>Summer Game Fest is an annual event Keighley started in 2020 in lieu of E3. Since 2021, there has been a kickoff showcase each June, and it serves as a console-agnostic showcase where developers can announce or debut new trailers for their upcoming games. We knew that Summer Game Fest would return sometime in 2025, but we didn't have a specific date until today. Keighley confirmed all of this on X and debuted Summer Game Fest 2025's brightly colored key art.</p><p>Summer Game Fest will return on June 6, although a specific time for the showcase isn't confirmed yet. Summer Game Fest 2024 took place 2 p.m. PT on June 7, 2024. It will be livestreamed for viewers at home, but people can also attend the event in person at the YouTube Theater in Los Angeles. No specific games or studios have confirmed their involvement in Summer Game Fest 2025 at this time, with Keighley simply saying that it will "showcase whatâ€™s next from the entire video game industry."</p><p>Keighley also affirmed that Summer Game Fest will once again be followed by a Play Days event for media and influencers this year. For those of you at home, the showcase on June 6 is the main thing that you should be looking forward to.</p>

                <p>Fans of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/control-review-an-action-packed-paranormal-portal/1900-6417278/" data-ref-id="1900-6417278">Control</a> may want to take note that there's a new third-person action-RPG that blends magic and gunplay. Nesting Games has announced The Directorate: Novitiate, a game that puts players in control of Kana Luna. By day, Kana is just a normal young woman living in Los Angeles in 2006. But by night, Kana goes by the codename Mercury while working as a magical assassin for the criminal underworld. In the first-look trailer below, Mercury uses her innate fighting and magic skills to take on human foes and otherworldly threats.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lfQXCis_qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9lfQXCis_qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Mercury, Kana can upgrade her magical abilities to further refine her combat options. Mercury isn't limited to only using guns in battle, and she can incorporate spells into her offense as well. Additionally, the game will be divided between Mercury's activities after dark--including her hunt for a supernatural serial killer--and her normal life as Kana during the day.</p><p>Outside of her working hours, Kana can pursue friendships or romance with the people she meets. However, those choices may endanger Kana's loved ones when the two sides of her life collide. According to Nesting Games, players will ultimately have the option of deciding whether Mercury will stay loyal to "the Edicts of the Directorate" or if she will decide to retain her humanity as Kana. Those choices will define Mercury's portrayal in the game.</p><p>The Directorate: Novitiate can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1883830/The_Directorate_Novitiate/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlisted on Steam</a>, and early access is expected to debut later this year. For now, there's no word about whether The Directorate: Novitiate will also be available on consoles.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has confirmed the title, setting, and release window of the next piece of DLC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2/" data-ref-id="5000-479459">Tom Clancy's The Division 2.</a> It's titled Battle for Brooklyn and will be released before the end of 2025.</p><p>The Division 2 was released in 2019 and has seen a healthy amount of post-launch support from Ubisoft since then. 2020's Warlords of New York DLC brought the series back to Manhattan, the setting of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division/" data-ref-id="5000-184123">first game in the series</a>. Ubisoft had previously teased that a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/72VfO2i8dx7NAhQ2DAHNJ5/year-6-the-division-2-the-road-ahead" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC set in Brooklyn</a> was in the works for Year 6 of support, but it faced a series of delays as Ubisoft focused on other aspects of the game.</p><p>As recently as January 28, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884255116636705006" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ubisoft told players</a> that the DLC would not ship during the Year 6 series of seasonal updates "to ensure we deliver the best possible experience." While that caused worry that the DLC could slip out of 2025 as well, Ubisoft took to X today, January 30, to share the first piece of key art and the title of the DLC.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Agents! We are heading back to New York. The Battle for Brooklyn DLC will be launching this year. Here's a sneak peekâ€”for your eyes only! ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://t.co/dRHLG5eVyB" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/dRHLG5eVyB</a></p>  â€” Tom Clancy's The Division (@TheDivisionGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1884982710440993240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>That key art doesn't reveal much about the DLC, featuring a squad of three exploring a street of Brooklyn with the Brooklyn Bridge in view. Previously, players were only able to briefly explore Brooklyn during the tutorial of The Division, so this DLC should offer a brand-new map to explore alongside a plethora of other new content.</p><p>Tom Clancy's The Division 2 is available for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Year 7 of support for The Division 2 should begin sometime in June 2025, so expect Battle for Brooklyn to launch in the back half of the year.</p><p>As for what's next for this franchise, Ubisoft confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-3/" data-ref-id="5000-604111">Tom Clancy's The Division 3</a> was in the works in 2023 but canceled a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/" data-ref-id="1100-6523480">Tom Clancy's The Division Heartland</a> that same year. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Takeover Anthem Animated Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The trailer mainly focuses on Octane as he battles his way through a match, but we also see what Legends like Alter and Loba get up to between matches: Loba steals stuff, and Alter terrorizes her interdimensional enemies. But a crowd of spectators and fans are also featured in the trailer, with many of them cosplaying as their favorite Legend.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Octane nearly bites the dust, but comes out on top with a narrow victory. The crowd goes wild, and the trailer cuts to a shot of Titanfall 2 big bad Kuben Blisk, who also serves as the official Apex Games commissioner. Blisk looks especially pleased with himself, as if Octane's win might be something he was hoping for.</p><p dir="ltr">One thing that's notably missing from the trailer is a new Legend. The trailer shows off plenty of familiar faces, but so far, it doesn't look like Season 24 will come with a new playable Legend.</p><p>Although the trailer does provide the name of Season 24 (Takeover), it doesn't provide any details on when the season will launch. The <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/takeover" rel="nofollow ">Season 24 page</a> on the official Apex Legends website simply reads, "We live to fight," followed by a promise that more details are coming next week. The end of the animated trailer says that a gameplay trailer is coming soon, but doesn't provide a specific date for the trailer or the launch of Season 24, though the new season is likely set to launch in early February.</p>
