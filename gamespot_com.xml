                <p> The Command &amp; Conquer community is in for a treat, as EA has released the source code for four classic C&amp;C games, as well as adding Steam Workshop support and releasing further modding tools for other titles in the franchise.</p><p>In collaboration with community creator Luke "CCHyper" Feenan, EA has released the fully recovered source code for the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer/" data-ref-id="5000-1">Command &amp; Conquer</a> (aka Tiberian Dawn), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-red-alert/" data-ref-id="5000-686">C&amp;C Red Alert</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-renegade/" data-ref-id="5000-2517">C&amp;C Renegade</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/command-and-conquer-generals/" data-ref-id="5000-4287">C&amp;C Generals</a>--along with its expansion pack, Zero Hour. The source code for the games is available on <a href="https://github.com/electronicarts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's GitHub page</a> under a GPL license, which grants users the right to run, study, share, or modify the software.</p><p>"Over the past year I have been working alongside the amazing C&amp;C stakeholders here at EA to restore the Perforce source code archives for the C&amp;C games back to buildable states, which now provides us with the ability to patch these classic games in a deeper way going forward," CCHyper said of his collaboration with the C&amp;C team at EA. "As a long time modder, it was amazing to finally get a chance to deep dive into the source code for these games and see how they work!"</p><p>With the first Command &amp; Conquer now over 30 years old, CCHyper celebrates the release of its recovered source code as a win for video game preservation, saying the decision will help fan communities to "continue to support these games and keep them playable for future generations to come."</p><p>Alongside the release of the source code, EA is also releasing further tools for modders, as well as Steam Workshop support for multiple C&amp;C titles including: C&amp;C Renegade, C&amp;C Generals &amp; Zero Hour, C&amp;C 3 Tiberium Wars and Kaneâ€™s Wrath, C&amp;C Red Alert 3 &amp; Uprising, and C&amp;C 4 Tiberian Twilight. Fans will also be able to publish maps directly to Steam Workshop through the Mission Editor and World Builder tools.</p><p>Modders will also be able to take advantage of a C&amp;C Modding Support Pack, which contains the source Xml, Schema, Script, Shader and Map files for all C&amp;C titles using the SAGE engine.</p><p>As one last gift to C&amp;C historians, EA has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN2gryZYz6g" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">half an hour of archive footage</a> from the development of Renegade and Generals, including tech demos and concept videos from the classic games. </p>
