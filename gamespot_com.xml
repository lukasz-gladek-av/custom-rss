                <p>A icy, post-apocalyptic wasteland and a "life-sustaining" train may evoke Oscar-winning director Bong Joon Ho's film Snowpiercer, but it's also the premise of developer FakeFish's newly revealed FPS survival game, Frostrail.</p><p dir="ltr">In Frostrail, up to four "pilgrims" will cooperate to survive a frozen apocalypse by gathering vital resources and combating "horrifying abominations," according to a press release. At the heart of the experience is the Eden Engine, a train that serves as players' home base as well as a mobile fortress against both monsters and mother nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_59w8EP9Qs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_59w8EP9Qs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will need to gather items from exploring exploring underground dungeons and destroyed ruins in order to craft new tools, weapons, and equipment, all the while battling monsters and surviving the inhospitable cold. Frostrail's reveal trailer highlights the game's weapon crafting, item scavenging, and FPS battles while giving a glimpse at the harsh locales and supernatural foes players will be forced to contend with.</p><p dir="ltr">The goal of Frostrail, according to lead designer Ez Jämsen in a press release, is to take the train far to the north "as an act of penitence and self-preservation," and "embark on a desperate journey alone or with a group where the threats are high, but the experience is unforgettable."</p><p dir="ltr">Though the premise initially sounds a bit like Snowpiercer, it also brings to mind 2019's single player-FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metro-exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-465542">Metro: Exodus</a>, which also revolves around a journey by train through a post-apocalyptic setting, battling monsters and other desperate survivors along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Frostrail will launch on PC in Steam early access sometime in 2026, and is FakeFish's second game following the Finnish studio's founding in 2014. The team previously developed the 2D, co-op submarine simulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/barotrauma/" data-ref-id="5000-463872">Barotrauma</a>, which has sold more than 3 million copies since its initial launch in 2019 and is still receiving new content updates.</p>

                <p>Vampire Survivors developer Poncle has officially revealed the next big--and free--update for the game on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. Shown off during the Triple-I Initiative stream, the Emerald Diorama is based on Square Enix’s fantasy RPG franchise SaGa, and it's now available to download.</p><p>The update adds a lot of new content to Vampire Survivors, including 12 new characters and skins, plenty of new weapons, and the Glimmer gameplay mechanic. Whenever you attack with specific weapons, there's a chance to instantly learn a special technique through this system, allowing you to unleash swords, sorcery, and missiles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS_hntZD318" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jS_hntZD318" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For the new characters, several SaGa protagonists will join the game roster. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido --</strong> A fate-forged master of Kugutsu puppets</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling -- </strong>An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie &amp; Formina -- </strong>A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms</li><li><strong>Diva No.5 -- </strong>A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds--and robotic bodies--in search of her heart</li></ul><p>Poncle says that you can also expect a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies, as well. Some of the other interesting features of this update include a "party" system of sorts for the SaGa crew, and when the health bar for these characters reaches a critically low point, they'll activate their Showstopper ability. This gives the heroes a brief boost to their Might, Luck, and Cooldown stats.</p><p>The action will also unfold on a new SaGa-inspired stage and there'll be several remixes of classic Saga tracks to listen to while you mow down hundreds of monsters.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legal-issue-preventing-vampire-survivors-from-getting-cross-save-on-playstation-consoles/1100-6530692/">Cross-save support is also headed to Vampire Survivors</a>, but not to PlayStation consoles due to a legal issue. Poncle cited privacy issues as the reason why cross-save will not be available on PS4 and PS5, and the developers says that chances of it coming to those consoles remain "slim" for now.</p>

                <p>During the Triple-I Initiative, developer 11 Bit Studios announced that sci-fi game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/" data-ref-id="5000-566112">The Alters</a> will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 13. The game will also be a day-one launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> for Xbox and PC.</p><p>In case you missed it when it was first announced, The Alters puts you in the boots of Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a space expedition that ended with his spaceship crash-landing on a hostile planet. Making his way to a mobile base, Jan quickly learns that he has three days to get it moving again before the planet's next sunrise incinerates it and him. The big problem? A lack of human and mineral resources to get the base on the move again. Fortunately, Jan can clone himself, but each new "Alter" represents an alternate version of himself shaped by different choices in his life.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF48QDkg3Cw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The more Alters you have, the better your odds of survival will be, but the challenge lies in managing a group of Jans who have unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. Players will also need to focus on managing their mobile base and dealing with the hazards of the world around them, as the game is a combination of survival, base-building, and exploration.</p><p>"Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-is-an-ambitious-genre-blending-survival-game/1100-6523693/" data-ref-id="1100-6523693">The Alters preview</a>. "No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special."</p><p>The Alters release date puts it in an interesting spot on the gaming calendar. It'll be arriving not long after the global launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and the month also has other games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/" data-ref-id="1100-6529987">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2s-long-awaited-nightdive-studios-remaster-has-a-new-name/1100-6529509/" data-ref-id="1100-6529509">System Shock 2 remaster</a>.</p>
