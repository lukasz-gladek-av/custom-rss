                <p>It's been a while since we've seen anything new from the hotly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong. However, there's a chance that it could show up during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a> on April 2.</p><p>On January 15, the day before Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2, Hollow Knight creator William Pellen said on Twitter, "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow." At the end of the Switch 2 reveal trailer, Nintendo also announced that it will host a Switch 2-focused Direct on April 2.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1879751713621725206%7Ctwgr%5E7566f332bf5134f452671fdd10c30fdba68bab45%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsilksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>  â€” little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The hints don't stop there. Pellen changed his Twitter profile picture to a slice of cake. A reverse image search on Google of the picture reveals that the recipe of the cake was posted on April 2, 2024. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fans think that this was a deliberate move</a>, and that Pellen is hinting that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be shown at the April 2025 Nintendo Direct.</p><p>Fans have been wondering when Hollow Knight: Silksong would be released, hoping that it would show up at various <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-april-17-how-to-watch-and-start-time/1100-6522678/" data-ref-id="1100-6522678">Indie World Directs</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-bethesda-games-showcase-2022/2300-6458585/" data-ref-id="2300-6458585">Xbox Game Showcases</a> over the past few years. But those hopes never materialized. The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley even had to temper expectations and confirmed that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/1100-6525900/" data-ref-id="1100-6525900">wasn't going to be shown at Gamescom 2024</a>.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 games, very little information has been revealed publicly, but it appears <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">a new Mario Kart game</a> is coming to the system. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-mario-kart-may-have-been-revealed-in-switch-2-trailer/1100-6528850/" data-ref-id="1100-6528850">teaser shown</a> during the Switch 2's reveal showed what appeared to be 24-player races, and we expect to see more come April.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-apes-hit/1900-6418328/" data-ref-id="1900-6418328">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, the remaster of the Wii and 3DS video game that was developed by Retro Studios. However, players have noted that the original team members at Retro are not given individual credits in the updated version. Instead, the credits state that it was "based on the work" of Retro Studios, while the team at Forever Entertainment gets its credits for working on the remaster. Now, Nintendo has issued a statement about the situation.</p><p>"We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process," said a Nintendo spokesperson to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p>That statement doesn't really address why the original team's names were excluded from the credits, and this has happened before. In 2023, the Retro Studios developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/" data-ref-id="1100-6511491">left out of the credits</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/" data-ref-id="1100-6511575">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/external-translators-are-frustrated-with-lack-of-credit-in-nintendo-games/1100-6524935/" data-ref-id="1100-6524935">external translators voiced their frustrations</a> last year because Nintendo didn't credit them for their work either.</p><p>This story has been largely overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">the reveal of Switch 2</a> earlier this week. It seems likely that the Donkey Kong Country franchise will be revisited on that system as well. However, it's not among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">games rumored for Switch 2</a>. In the meantime, the bizarre Donkey Kong Country animated TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nightmare-fuel-donkey-kong-country-tv-series-is-free-to-watch-on-youtube-and-amazon/1100-6505494/" data-ref-id="1100-6505494">is still available to watch on Prime Video</a>.</p>
