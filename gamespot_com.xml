                <p>Xbox has expanded its game streaming perk for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Starting today, July 28, players can now stream their Xbox library to their PCs directly through the Xbox PC app.</p><p>In recent years, Microsoft has added the ability to stream your Xbox library to many devices, including Xbox consoles, smart TVs, and browsers. It <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-july-update-more-ways-to-play/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> today that this functionality has finally been added to the Xbox app on PC, meaning that most Xbox-related functionality should now be available in the app.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4539563"></a><figcaption>Your Xbox library has gotten a fresh coat of paint across devices.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4539563-7798981786-July-.jpg"></figure><p>Streaming Xbox games isn't just a neat way to access your Game Pass library when you're away from your console or home PC. It also lets PC-only players access Xbox console exclusives that haven't made their way to PC yet.</p><p>Microsoft has also rolled out a bunch of other upgrades for the Xbox PC app. These are highlighted by efforts to consolidate and streamline the cloud gaming process. The app surfaces cross-device play history, meaning that you can start playing a game on Xbox and pick up your progress via game streaming in the app. The app update also adds a more cohesive game library, combining all games available to stream across consoles, including both purchased games and those available via Game Pass. Both of these changes are currently available for members of the Xbox Insider program, which is <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/manage-account/xbox-insider-program" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free to join and open for everyone.</a></p><p>Finally, the Xbox PC app now has an easier way to track Microsoft Rewards. Microsoft states that the new system will surface Rewards progress as you play, allowing you to track points across play sessions.</p>

                <p>F1 star Lewis Hamilton is just like many gamers in that he's very excited for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>. Speaking to fans recently, Hamilton listed off some of his favorite games, going on to single out GTA 6 as a game that he's so amped for that he's planning to "cancel all my work" when it releases.</p><p>"I'm a big gamer. I play a lot of Call of Duty, for sure... but I like Assassin’s Creed, Gran Turismo," he said. "I'm dying for the new Grand Theft Auto to come out. GTA 6! Yeah, that's the one I'm waiting for. I'll have to cancel all my work when that game comes out."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gta/gta-6s-hype-is-so-big-f1-drivers-are-canceling-work-for-it-3231088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto points out</a>, there is a small break in the <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/formula-1-reveals-calendar-for-2026-season.YctbMZWqBvrgyddrnauo8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2026 F1 schedule</a> around the time that GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026, so that might work out nicely for Hamilton.</p><p>GTA 6 was originally set to be released in Fall 2025 before Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">delayed it to May 2026 to help give it more polish. </a></p><p>"In this case there was an opportunity with a small amount of incremental time, we thought, to make sure Rockstar Games achieves its creative vision with no limitations. And I supported of course that approach," Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said. "While of course, delays pain me--how could they not?--the most important thing to do is to support your teams in their search for perfection."</p><p>GTA 6 will hit PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/">PC version is expected to be released at a later date</a>.</p>

It also added a new team-up ability, First Steps, for the Human Torch and The Thing that's ripped straight from the film--Human Torch picking up Ben Grimm and flying him through the air while on fire before hurling him into the ground, damaging enemies in an area and preventing them from using mobility abilities.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately for The Thing, the ability's usefulness depends on the person playing Human Torch, as they are essentially the driver of the ability and in full control. That's leading to some annoying (but admittedly funny) scenarios where Human Torch players are trolling Thing players by encouraging them to team-up and then swiftly sending them flying off the map to their death. You can see some terrible (or great) examples of that below.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, First Steps (when used normally) is a decent team-up ability that's great for locking down an objective or diving onto enemy players. That's more than can be said of some team-up abilities, which run the gamut between extremely powerful and largely useless. An example of a less-than-great team-up is Hulk and Wolverine's Fastball Special, which is similar to First Steps in that it lets Hulk pick up Logan and hurl him through the air.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-battle-pass-season-3-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6762/" data-ref-id="2900-6762">Marvel Rivals Season 3</a> launched July 11 and added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">Jean Grey (aka Phoenix)</a> to the game's ever expanding roster, with Blade set to be added later in the season.

                <p>The people yearn to hike and porter, according to newly released Death Stranding 2 statistics. Director Hideo Kojima has reported that just under 80% percent of players (called "someones" by Kojima) who finished the game continued past the credits. He did not report how many players this represents, but did share a variety of other statistics concerning player behavior.</p><p dir="ltr">Kojima tweeted these details out as part of a post celebrating the game's one-month anniversary. It might not surprise you that the assault rifle was Death Stranding 2's most equipped weapon or the ladder its most equipped tool. But the statistics do include some of Death Stranding 2's sillier features. Out of all the animals players could rescue, they saved kangaroos the most (followed by emus and wombats). Via signage, players placed the "speed up" sign the most often. The post doesn't list any player count statistics, but Death Stranding 2 is popular. The game topped <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-and-rematch-top-the-ps5-charts-in-june-2025/2900-6742/">the PS5 charts in June</a>. The statistics also emphasize the game's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-on-the-beach-community-build/1100-6533237/">asynchronous multiplayer</a>, where players build structures and place tips to help each other.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding 2.<br>It’s been a month since release. It seems many players have already reached the ending. Since all the “Someones” around the world are connected through SSS, we’re able to gather a variety of data. Apparently, 79% of “Someones” who reached the end of the story… <a href="https://t.co/HgXtHsEYWC" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/HgXtHsEYWC</a></p>  — HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1949010026699350142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">In typical Kojima fashion, the post also features some of his philosophical musings. He wrote, "To everyone who has reached the ending: The world today is in a difficult state. It might be hard to hold on to hope for tomorrow. But know that there is someone out there who would risk their life to protect you—Even if you don’t notice, someone is connected to you, watching over you."</p><p dir="ltr">If you are one of the "someones" who completed Death Stranding 2, check out GameSpot's <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-ending-new-game-plus-post-credits/2900-6733/">ending explained guide</a>.</p>
