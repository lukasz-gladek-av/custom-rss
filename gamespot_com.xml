                <p>After nearly 20 years, Okami is back. Announced at The Game Awards 2024, Okami Sequel is the working title for the follow-up to 2006's Okami, a critically acclaimed action-adventure game beloved for its painterly visuals and beautiful retelling of Japanese mythology. As of right now, there is no release date for the title, but a brief teaser shows us the return of its signature animation style and its main character, the sun goddess Okami Amaterasu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSoZgCCxyQc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mSoZgCCxyQc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also returning to Okami is its creator, Hideki Kamiya, who will serve once again as the game's director. Known for his work on the first few Resident Evil games and for creating some of Capcom's most iconic series--series such as Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, and Okami--Kamiya is an incredibly prominent figure in the gaming industry. Late last year, he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/platinum-games-hideki-kamiya-isnt-retiring-but-cant-create-games-for-a-year/1100-6518369/" data-ref-id="1100-6518369">announced his departure</a> from long-time studio PlatinumGames, stating he needed to follow his "beliefs as a game creator." It now seems as though this might have been to reunite with Capcom for the Okami sequel.</p><p>Based on the Japanese legend of Amaterasu, Okami follows the sun goddess as she takes on the form of a wolf in order to save Japan from encroaching darkness. Back in 2006, GameSpot called Okami a "game so well crafted from top to bottom that it's bound to impress just about anyone who gives it a chance" in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/okami-review/1900-6157846/" data-ref-id="1900-6157846">review</a>.</p><p>Yet Okami 2 was not the only major reveal at The Game Awards 2024. We also got a look at The Last of Us studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, and CD Projekt Red's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-first-trailer-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528436/" data-ref-id="1100-6528436">The Witcher 4</a>.
