          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is officially getting a premium currency just for player-housing items, and Blizzard is now looking to explain its reasoning to a concerned and upset playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">Following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-looks-to-be-getting-a-new-premium-currency-for-housing/1100-6535888/" data-ref-id="1100-6535888">datamine earlier this week</a> that hinted at a new premium currency called Hearthsteel, Blizzard has confirmed the currency is real and how it plans to implement it in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. Once WoW's Midnight expansion releases, Hearthsteel will be available for purchase with real money and will only be used for housing items in the in-game shop. Items and Hearthsteel amounts available for purchase should align in a "player-friendly way," Blizzard states.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The big question many players have is why introduce a virtual currency at all? Microtransactions have existed in WoW for a long time now. Blizzard confirmed earlier this year it would sell premium housing items, something that was expected. But buying a fancy store mount or transmog set has always been done with real money as opposed to having to first buy a currency. According to Blizzard, using real money when purchasing multiple items can be "inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard then seems to confirm that players who buy housing items on the shop will need to buy multiples of the same item if they want, for example, a full set of chairs, as opposed to making a single purchase and then being able to put down as many chairs as one wants.</p><p dir="ltr">"Using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient," Blizzard states.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard notes that as is the case with store mounts, the vast majority of housing items will be earnable in-game by playing, with only a small selection of housing items available on the shop. Housing items tied to a core class or race fantasy, or "thematically important decor," won't be sold in the shop either. A housing catalog will be visible in the house-decorating UI that will let players preview decor items (including ones from the shop), so players can decide if they wish to purchase or work towards earning a specific piece of decor.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of Blizzard's Hearthsteel blog post tells players to keep the feedback coming, and judging from places like the WoW subreddit, there is plenty of (negative) feedback to go around. Some players aren't finding Blizzard's justification for the virtual currency convincing.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only reason for a virtual currency is to do the exact opposite and nudge people into buying more shit because they have leftover balance," user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnh43m0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pariah</a> writes. "As if that's a secret to anyone these days."</p><p dir="ltr">As another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnghh4b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lord0fHats</a>, puts it: "Selling housing decor and such was a no brainer, but they had to adopt a particularly toxic method of doing it. Very disappointing."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not player concerns and feedback will cause Blizzard to reconsider its approach remains to be seen, but for many players who have been waiting for player housing for decades, the pivot into a virtual currency looks like nothing more than a cash grab.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW microtransaction news, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/" data-ref-id="1100-6535911">infamous $90 dinosaur mount</a> may be returning to the shop. Housing early access, meanwhile, is set to arrive with the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">11.2.7 patch</a> before the end of the year, with Midnight proper set to release early in 2026. Those waiting for WoW to arrive on console will keep waiting, as the game's director said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/" data-ref-id="1100-6535952">console version of WoW isn't in the works</a>.</p>

A game delay is never good news, but for Take-Two Interactive, the news saw its stock price temporarily drop while the industry calibrated itself for the later launch.</p><p>GTA 6 is regarded as something truly special, a once-in-a-generation release that is being fueled by an absurd amount of hype. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/">Even a simple YouTube trailer dominates discussions for days</a> after it's released--and reignites interest in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers--and the delay has gotten a lot of responses from just about everyone with their finger on the pulse of the gaming community.</p><p>Big brands like Dominos Pizza and KFC haven't missed with their responses, and someone at Red Bull Gaming needs to stop drinking a dangerous amount of overly caffeinated energy drinks. Some of the responses have been brutally honest, others have taken the news in their stride with cheeky responses, and some people have overreacted really badly to the delay.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a lot of games scheduled to launch next year, and if you want to plan around GTA 6, you can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/" data-ref-id="1100-6534941" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/">2026 game releases</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT <a href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1">https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1</a></p>— Red Bull Gaming (@redbullgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Several analysts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/">GTA 6 is the single most important game release of all time</a>, and its predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/">sell 40 million units within its first year of release</a>.

                <p>Rockstar's 2018 open-world Western Red Dead Redemption 2 is a huge success with more than 79 million copies sold, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top five best-selling games in history</a>. The game is expected to continue to make a mark on the gaming industry with rumored ports for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. The ports have not been officially announced, but there have been some developments, and in this post, we're rounding up everything we've heard about the rumored ports.</p><h2 id="What_do_we_know_"><strong>What do we know?</strong></h2><p>Earlier this year, reliable leaker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Nate the Hate said</a> a port of Red Dead Redemption 2 was headed to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, alongside an update that improves the game on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S already through backwards compatibility. That was also true for GTA 5, which was playable on the latest consoles prior to Rockstar releasing new versions of GTA 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in March 2022 with significant upgrades.</p><p>Then in October 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">Nate the Hate said the ports are still in the works</a>, but had no information to share regarding when they could be released.</p><p>There is no word on what the rumored PS5 and Xbox Series X|S upgrades could be, but improved graphics and performance are two possibilities.</p><p>The original Red Dead Redemption, meanwhile, came to Switch in 2023 after it originally launched in 2010.</p><h2 id="What_has_Rockstar_Take_Two_said_"><strong>What has Rockstar/Take-Two said?</strong></h2><p>Officially, Rockstar and Take-Two have not said a peep about new ports of Red Dead Redemption 2.

                <p>Following in Florida's footsteps, Texas's attorney general has sued Roblox Corporation, the developer of the multiplayer online game creation platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, for "flagrantly ignoring" laws and exposing children to "sexually explicit content, exploitation, and grooming."</p><p>Ken Paxton, a Republican who's been Texas's AG since 2015 and is making a bid for U.S. Senate, <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced the lawsuit in an X post</a> on November 6. In the documentation, his office claimed Roblox Corporation was "flagrantly ignoring state and federal laws while deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform." The suit continues, claiming that Paxton is taking action because "Roblox chose to put pixel pedophiles and corporate profit over the safety of Texas children."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">BREAKING: I'm suing Roblox for putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children.<br>We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed. <a href="https://t.co/Jj2kHEJM75" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/Jj2kHEJM75</a></p>  — Attorney General Ken Paxton (@KenPaxtonTX) <a href="https://twitter.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"We cannot allow platforms like Roblox to continue operating as digital playgrounds for predators where the well-being of our kids is sacrificed on the altar of corporate greed," Paxton said. "Roblox must do more to protect kids from sick and twisted freaks hiding behind a screen. Any corporation that enables child abuse will face the full and unrelenting force of the law."</p><p>A <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0kd4kk0kqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Roblox Corporation spokesperson told the BBC</a> on November 6 that the company was "disappointed" to receive the lawsuit, stating it's all based on "misrepresentations and sensationalized claims." The spokesperson went on to say that Roblox Corporation shares Paxton's commitment to child safety and has introduced measures that remove bad actors and protect its users in Roblox.</p><p>Roblox has come under fire in recent years for its child safety concerns. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">June 2024 Bloomberg investigation</a> discovered an infestation of pedophiles on the platform that has a userbase largely composed of minors, prompting other AGs from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/">Florida </a>to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/louisiana-sues-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Louisiana</a> to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kentucky-attorney-general-russell-coleman-sues-roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky</a> to file lawsuits.
