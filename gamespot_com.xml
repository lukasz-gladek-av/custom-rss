                <p dir="ltr">Games based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons aren't anything new, but it's no secret that Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> did a lot to popularize video games in which you roll dice. In the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/following-baldurs-gate-3-wotc-and-hasbro-are-investing-1-billion-in-their-aaa-game-ecosystem/1100-6522241/">Wizard of the Coast invested $1 billion into its gaming ecosystem</a>, partnering with several different developers to create their own takes on D&amp;D, such as Tactical Adventures' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-5e-is-fully-represented-in-solasta-2-for-better-and-worse/1100-6529659/"><em>very </em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition-coded Solasta II</a> and an unnamed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/">single-player D&amp;D game from Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen's new studio</a>. Unless WotC does a mass cancellation (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/">the five D&amp;D games canned</a> just prior to the release of Baldur's Gate 3), we can expect quite a few D&amp;D games over the next several years.</p><p dir="ltr">The next one is slated for this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked/" data-ref-id="5000-660554">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>, a mouthful of a title for a fun four-player co-op game. If Baldur's Gate 3 is for folks who want something on par with the mechanical crunch of D&amp;D Fifth Edition, then Battlemarked feels like the ideal choice for those who want something more approachable--a game to play with kids too young for something like Baldur's Gate 3, or other adults too busy to devote hours to a hobby as time-consuming as D&amp;D.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKLByGDB6Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SRKLByGDB6Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot got an exclusive first look at Battlemarked, playing through two early levels alongside game director Gustav Stenmark and PR director Jamie Camargo. While I played as a Tiefling Rogue, Camargo played as an Elf Ranger, and Stenmark controlled two characters: a Dragonborn Paladin and Gnome Wizard. The first level we played through was a simple encounter between the party of heroic adventurers and a band of attacking goblins, while the second was the first floor of a multi-leveled dungeon crawl.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlemarked is set in the Forgotten Realms, the same setting as Baldur's Gate 3 and the recent Honor Among Thieves movie, making Battlemarked a great way to revisit familiar locations and characters that may have grown stale over repeat playthroughs or watches. There seems to be a concerted effort to build on this setting, rather than branch off into Eberron, Krynn, or something homebrewed. I'm still hoping we get a game that goes to Eberron one day, but I did like how easy it was to familiarize myself with what's going on in Battlemarked's story, who the bad guys in a fight are, and how certain non-player characters might react to specific dialogue choices. The familiar setting feeds into Battlemarked's approachable nature, speaking "the same language" as the most popular framework through which stories in D&amp;D have been told.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133"></a><figcaption>The demo kicked off with fending off a goblin ambush.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But it's the gameplay, not the narrative details, that had me begging Stenmark and Camargo to play past my allotted preview session. In Battlemarked, most missions focus on combat. It's turn-based, with each player taking a turn before the enemy creatures then all simultaneously go. Each class has a deck of 10 cards that they bring into battle, and draw from each turn, and every player gets two Actions per turn. Each card has an Action cost ranging from 0 to two, and movement, melee attacks, and interacting with the environment each take one Action.</p><p dir="ltr">I love this structure. I've long disliked how D&amp;D's combat--which largely separates everything into an Action, Bonus Action, Free Action, and Movement--can make things difficult for new players to grasp. Why is this one spell an Action, while this other one is a Bonus Action, and this one specific feature that this one class has that's <em>like </em>magic is a Free Action? Balance, mainly. But there's no easy rule of thumb as to why some stuff is an Action and some stuff is a Bonus Action. You just have to know. That means memorization. And that takes time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134"></a><figcaption>For the second part of the demo, we went into a dungeon crawl.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lots of other tabletop systems (Pathfinder most notably) have adopted a structure like what Battlemarked has, where <em>everything </em>is just an Action, and each player has the same number of Actions per turn. This is much easier to understand, but Battlemarked maintains D&amp;D's strategic elements and teamplay by relying on cards. With 10 cards in the deck, you'll understand what your class can do fairly quickly but you only ever have about five or six cards in your hand at a time (occasionally, a player might find a potion or two in the environment, which appears as an extra card in your hand until used), so you have to plan in the moment with what cards you have and attempt to plan for what's to come based on what card you might draw on your next turn.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rogue has a card that lets them turn invisible for three turns, letting them land a more lethal melee attack from anywhere--not just a backstab. Once you attack, the invisibility ends early. This card is a great way to escape from a sticky situation, but I preferred saving it because if I drew a card called Knock Out, I could perform the Rogue's unique melee strike that stunned an enemy, leaving them open for the Paladin's devastating Smite or Wizard's explosive Fireball. Best part: Knock Out has the unique effect of not breaking invisibility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135"></a><figcaption>The maps in Battlemarked are quite detailed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A few other cards have a similar level of synergy. The Dragonborn's poison breath could coat enemies and the ground in deadly fumes that could be ignited for further damage by the Wizard's fiery spells, and the Ranger's assortment of trick arrows could bunch up enemies to leave them susceptible to the Rogue's assortment of bombs. And this was just the demo, with everyone running with an unchanging deck of 10 cards. The full game lets you unlock new abilities and customize your deck, curating the ideal playstyle for your chosen class. There's a nice level of depth to Battlemarked's combat despite how easy it is to pick up.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game I'm still unsure of is the narrative, simply because the demo I played didn't feature much of it. Like D&amp;D, your character has ability scores that provide bonuses to skills like Persuasion and Arcana, and when speaking to non-player characters, you can attempt a roll of the dice with these skills to try to glean additional information or convince others to do as you please. During the demo, Stenmark convinced a noble of our friendly nature so that he would trust us, for example, while I failed at identifying a strange mushroom and chose to just eat it (it was deeply poisonous, so lesson learned), and we both couldn't manage to convince a group of deadly myconids that we came in peace, leading to an amusing battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136"></a><figcaption>You can use enviornmental hazards to your advantage as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On first glance, there doesn't seem to be as much narrative depth in Battlemarked as what's been seen in other dice-based RPGs, like Baldur's Gate 3 or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector/" data-ref-id="5000-590957">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>. But the outcomes of the few choices our group made were rewarding each time--either because we got what we wanted, or we failed, but the outcome of failure was written to be hilarious or at least not so devastating that it demanded we restart the current encounter. It seems like the dialogue choices and more story-driven elements will provide sufficient enjoyment, but the best part of the game is clearly the card-based, D&amp;D-inspired combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is launching for PC, PS5, and Meta Quest on November 20.</p>

<p>"There were a number of learnings we had from creepy king," Yashinsky said. "And we've moved away from creepy king because he had limited appeal."</p><p>If you remember Sneak King--or the "Creepy King" mascot Burger King used from 2004 to 2011--the game put you behind The King's mask and tasked you with stealthily delivering different types of meals to hungry folks. It was one of three games known as The Burger King Games, which included the bumper car sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/big-bumpin/" data-ref-id="5000-28541">Big Bumpin'</a>, the pocketbike racer ... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pocketbike-racer/" data-ref-id="5000-28540">PocketBike Racer</a>, and Sneak King.</p><p>Sneak King was a weird licensed game that developed a somewhat cult following, with players like Redditor JR_Masterson "waiting for a Sneak King sequel" for over 18 years now. All that waiting may be for naught, though, as Burger King, according to Restaurant Business, now seeks to move passed this frightening mascot era.</p>

It's a big deal, after all, particularly because ZA/UM's recognized union could provide hope for other developers in the UK looking to gain collective power.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Zero Parades (Project C4) Preview: ZA/UM’s Latest Is A Spy Fantasy</p>
      </div>
<p>As the blog post noted, this is an "exciting milestone for workers industry-wide" that will give employees and management the appropriate means to negotiate workplace-related matters revolving around mental health, financial stability, and social livelihoods. ZA/UM will elect a committee of workplace representatives--with the IWGB support--to discuss the team's concerns. In essence, ZA/UM developers will now have the power.</p><p>McParlin-Jones reiterated their hope for other game developers to "join us" in the fight for a better industry, stating that recognized unions are how to achieve it.</p><p>"Anyone working in the sector can see that the game has been rigged against us for far too long. Now developers at ZA/UM are proving that by coming together as a union we can take back power and shape our workplaces for the better," McParlin-Jones said. "We need to build an industry where workers can create exciting, meaningful games without sacrificing their social lives, their mental health, or their financial stability."</p><p>Peruzzo added to McParlin-Jones' statement, saying this recognition is proof of developers' power and not a one-off agreement, but rather "an avalanche in the making."</p><p>"Our first IWGB ZA/UM recognition agreement is proof of the power that game workers have when they come together, trust each other and join our Union," Peruzzo said. "Recognition agreements lay the groundwork for a healthy relationship between the company and workers and rebalance the scale of powers after a few terrible years for the game industry and the redundancies we have seen happening at ZA/UM lately. We are looking forward to many more to come in the future."</p><p>In other ZA/UM news, the studio has finally revealed its next project during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7073/" data-ref-id="2900-7073">Sony's September 24 State of Play livestream</a>. Titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zero-parades-espionage-rpg-from-disco-elysium-dev-at-sony-state-of-play/1100-6534989/" data-ref-id="1100-6534989">Zero Parades</a>, the espionage RPG implements Disco Elysium's familiar isometric point of view and randomized dice-roll-like scenarios. It's slated to launch sometime next year.</p>

Black Ops 7 expands on last year's omnimovement, bringing even faster and more fluid omnidirectional movement as well as the new ability to wall jump.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical layout is recommended for those using a standard controller, as it maps your crouch/slide/dive button to the thumbstick, so you can be quick without ever needing to move your thumb. If you have something like a Scuf or another brand of controller that lets you remap the buttons, you can just leave this on its default setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger Effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5.

This test will give you numbers on the bottom of the left and right stick images.

You want to hear those footsteps at 100. Dialogue volume includes important announcer callouts about enemy scorestreaks and such, so you don't want this sound turned down too far either.

                <p>Rockstar Games has announced plans for how Grand Theft Auto V will celebrate Halloween, and there is a lot of spooky content on tap.</p><p>To begin with, the Cayo Perico Survival and Ludendorff Cemetery Survival modes are back, but with a zombie twist for Halloween. Players will face off against "tides of zombies" in these locations, along with "hulking juggernauts, armored conquistadors, splitters, possessed animals and their trainers, zombie DJs, and more," Rockstar said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578978" data-ratio="0.54885301614274" data-width="1177" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578978"></a><figcaption>Halloween comes to GTA Online.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578978-screenshot2025-10-02at2.21.05%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>The Cayo Perico Survival mode pays out double GTA$ and RP now through October 8, while the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival mode pays triple rewards October 23-November 5.</p><p>The GTA Online Halloween update also includes a variant of the Slasher mode. In this new twist, players battle it out in the tight confines of the Ramius submarine. In the Slasher mode, one person plays as the Slasher, armed with a shotgun and able to use a flashlight to get around. After a period of three minutes, the players being hunted are granted shotguns of their own to go after the Slasher. This mode will pay out double GTA$ and RP October 16-22. The standard versions of Slasher are back in October as well.</p><p>Additionally, Rockstar is adding a different Halloween-themed mode each week in October. Here is the schedule:</p><ul><li>October 2–8: Beast vs. Slasher</li><li>October 9–15: Judgement Day</li><li>October 16–22: Slasher (Ramius Submarine)</li><li>October 23–29: Condemned</li><li>October 30–November 5: Slasher (includes Ramius Submarine)</li></ul><p>What's more, Rockstar said fans can look forward to "plenty more off-kilter events" in GTA Online throughout October. For example, players may notice UFOs in the sky and might even see people get abducted. Players can also take on missions where they help investigators find evidence of supernatural beings. There are also jack o' lanterns scattered throughout the world that players can collect for extra GTA$.</p><p>Finally, GTA+ subscribers are getting "Halloween-themed rewards" starting October 9, but they haven't been officially announced yet.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> is the next entry in the series, and it was originally supposed to launch sometime around now prior to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">high-profile delay to 2026</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-and-galaxy-2-are-still-peak-3d-platforming/1100-6535097/" data-ref-id="1100-6535097">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> finally made their way to the Switch, and they've never looked better. Before now, you could only play them on the old Wii or through the limited-time Super Mario 3D All-Stars collection on Switch--which didn't even include Galaxy 2. Now, both games are available on the regular Switch and Switch 2.</p><p>There are a lot of things to appreciate with the new remasters, and Digital Foundry took a deep dive into the biggest differences and the mild downgrades. The biggest difference is that the original Switch runs the games at up to 1080p, while the Switch 2 boosts the visuals all the way to 4K resolution, making everything look much sharper and cleaner, especially on modern TVs. You can check out the full breakdown below. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qWUbpoFO6-Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Basically, most of the menus, cutscenes, and controls are the same as the 2020 3D All-Stars version, including things like touchscreen and motion controls. The pre-rendered cutscenes still run at 1080p, even on Switch 2, and haven't been upgraded to 4K. That's a bit of a letdown, especially since those scenes also show some compression issues and color problems. Still, the improved resolution and sharper gameplay visuals on Switch 2 do a lot to make up for it. Shadows now show from farther away, and character models look better at a distance, too.</p><p>Another huge improvement are the new high-resolution textures. Nintendo updated nearly every surface in the game--grass, dirt, rocks, bricks, and even character clothing. These textures look much clearer and more detailed than on the original Wii. For example, Mario's overalls now have visible stitching, and Peach's eyes and eyelashes are more detailed. Some areas, like the hay in the Dino Piranha's nest and the brick paths in Honeyhive Galaxy, show big upgrades while still keeping the original design.</p><p>There are a few small downsides. The cutscene videos still look a bit compressed, and color banding can sometimes be seen in skies or backgrounds. But overall, these new versions of Galaxy 1 and 2 look better than ever. The Switch 2 version especially benefits from the higher resolution and cleaner textures, though even the regular Switch version is a nice improvement over the old Wii release. While not a full remake, this remaster does a great job of polishing up two of Nintendo's best platformers for a new generation.</p>
