                <p>There's a hot new machine from Nintendo that everybody's talking about that just received a major update, and you know we don't mean the Switch 2. Yes, Nintendo's motion-activated alarm clock got a free update recently that adds scenes from the original NES Super Mario Bros. to the proceedings.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the social media post announcing the move, you can receive these new scenes by connecting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/" data-ref-id="1100-6529653">your Alarmo</a> to the internet and linking it to your Nintendo Account. These scenes are the first from a retro Nintendo game, as the rest of those with scenes featured are all on the Switch. Those games include Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Splatoon 3, Pikmin 4, and Ring Fit Adventure. Connecting your Nintendo account will also give you access to scenes from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><p dir="ltr">Retailing for $100, the Alarmo is a motion-activated alarm clock with sleep tracking features. It offers a variety of alarms, including "Gentle," which keeps the tone at one set volume, and "Steady," which makes the alarm increasingly louder. The Alarmo does not interact with other Nintendo devices and is not a limited-time or limited-edition product, unlike some other Nintendo devices from over the years.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo news, the company the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">much-anticipated Switch 2</a> back in January. A Nintendo Direct that will presumably answer many questions about the new console, such as when it will be released, will be held on April 2.</p>
