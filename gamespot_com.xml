                <p>Innersloth has made a series of Among Us announcements, including a brand-new game: Among Us 3D. A demo for the game, which shifts the perspective to a first-person view, will be available during Steam Next Fest beginning on February 24.</p><p>Among Us 3D for Steam allows players to join cross-platform lobbies with people playing Among Us in VR on Meta Quest, Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, and PICO. "Fans can expect the same intense, fast-paced gameplay, complete with voice chat, new customization options, game modes, roles, and all the deception-filled fun--without the need for a VR headset," Innersloth said in its announcement.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a first look at Among Us 3D.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYMaaMTgxa4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UYMaaMTgxa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Among Us 3D is not compatible, however, with the original Among Us.</p><p>Innersloth also announced that Among Us VR is changing names in the coming months and will be renamed Among Us 3D. The studio also announced that it's launching a new in-game currency called "Stardust." Players can spend this on customization options, and this seemingly builds on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/big-among-us-cosmicubes-update-adds-in-game-store-four-new-roles/1100-6497854/" data-ref-id="1100-6497854">game's previous cosmetic microtransactions.</a></p><p>Among Us 3D is available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/" rel="nofollow "><u>Steam</u></a> now, and the demo will be available February 24-March 3 as part of Steam Next Fest.</p>

Assuming it's styled for America, this would point to March 4, 2025. Exactly what could happen on that day, however, is unknown.

A remastered version is out now as part of the Season 2 Reloaded update with a fresh coat of paint and this apparent THPS teaser.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Looks like a teaser for something related to Tony Hawkâ€™s Pro Skater has been found in Black Ops 6â€™s Grind MP map!<br>Announcement on March 4. ðŸ‘€ <a href="https://t.co/8efl6Qansl" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/8efl6Qansl</a></p>  â€” CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1892621320598208577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In other skateboarding news, the Season 2 Reloaded update adds a new melee weapon in the form of a skateboard that you can whack someone over the head with to take them down with one hit.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4447186"></a><figcaption>Smack your enemies with a skateboard in Black Ops 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4447186-skateboardmelee.jpg"></figure><p>Recently, real-life pro skater <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unannounced-tony-hawk-remaster-on-the-way-pro-skater-claims/1100-6529542/" data-ref-id="1100-6529542">Tyshawn Jones claimed that he was in an upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> game even though Activision had not announced a new one yet.

                <p>Funcom has announced that its MMO survival game, Dune: Awakening, will launch for PC on May 20. The game is also slated for a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S launch, but a release date for those versions hasn't been revealed yet.</p><p>In this iteration of the Dune universe, the main protagonist Paul Atreides was never born. Players assume the role of a prisoner sent to Arrakis to uncover the mystery around the Fremen's disappearance. Along the journey, players will rise from being a nameless survivor to either becoming an agent of the Atreides or the Harkonnen.</p><p>The game will cost $50 and those who preorder will receive a decoration called the Terrarium of Muad'Dib that they can place in their bases.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gl6Wi20fSp0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gl6Wi20fSp0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can also download the character creator and benchmark tool to receive a special code to redeem a Frameblade Knife at launch. Characters can be saved and imported to the full game, and the benchmark tool lets players know if their hardware can run it. While Funcom hasn't revealed the full specification requirements, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> notes that it requires a 64-bit processor and operating system at least.</p><p>Dune: Awakening features an ever-changing open-world desert that shifts every week, and players can explore new locations and rewards. There will be server-wide politics in the form of Landsraad decrees, where every player will be impacted whether they're aligned with Altreidas or Harkonnen.</p><p>While the game is multiplayer, players can choose to experience the storyline alone, and PvP is always optional. Players can also sign up for the beta on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/" data-target="true">game's official website</a>.</p><p>Dune: Awakening's unique world will also have players being able to team up with characters who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-mmo-will-let-players-team-up-with-characters-who-are-dead-in-the-book/1100-6511909/" data-ref-id="1100-6511909">are dead in the book series</a>, and Funcom is "rethinking" <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-rethinking-survival-game-staples-according-to-new-interview/1100-6511865/" data-ref-id="1100-6511865">survival game mechanics</a> and staples with this game.</p>

project. The Warhammer 40K sequel was developed by Saber St. Petersburg, which is one of several subsidiaries owned by the company. As for the IP that Saber will be adapting, that remains a mystery for now, as Hasbro owns multiple brands like Transformers, GI Joe, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Magic the Gathering, My Little Pony, and Peppa Pig.</p><p>This is also one of several video game projects in development, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/">Invoke Studios is working on a new Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a>, Atomic Arcade is handling a GI Joe spin-off starring Snake Eyes, and Austin-based studio Skeleton Key is working on a mystery project. A Transformers game would likely be a good fit for Saber, as this is one IP that fans of the franchise have been requesting to see more of.</p><p>While Transformers hasn't been dormant in the video game space, recent releases like Galactic Trials and Earthspark Expedition haven't quite managed to scratch the itch for Autobot action in the same way that games like War for Cybertron or Transformers: Devastation did when they were released back in the 2010s.</p><p>Sadly, one promising Transformers game, Transformers: Reactivate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/transformers-reactivate-canceled/1100-6528693/">was canceled earlier this year</a> after having been in development at British studio Splash Damage.</p>
