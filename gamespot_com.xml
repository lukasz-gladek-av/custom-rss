                <p>Famously, parks full of monsters always work out well, right? Those things never like... get loose and wreak havoc on their captors, forcing them to deal with the morality (not to mention safety) of these decisions, do they? Okay cool, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> is making a second Tyranny Park.</p><p>Or at least, it's trying to. Helldivers 2's latest major order--a series of challenges for players to complete as a community--promises the erection of a new Tyranny Park for a hefty set of prices, including the liberation of a planet, the extermination of quite literally millions of the game's bug-like Terminid enemies, and more. Only then can Tyranny Park 2 be completed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1955557044976542126" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">MAJOR ORDER: The citizens of Super Earth have endured over a year of war, initiated and perpetuated by the enemies of Freedom. And while their resolve is firm, they must be afforded some relief. Diversion is demanded - and deserved.<br>Accordingly, the Super Earth Government has… <a href="https://t.co/TJZYAwJTKy" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/TJZYAwJTKy</a></p>  — HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1955557044976542126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>To be specific, players must complete the following milestones to see the likely disastrous construction of Tyranny Park 2 become real:</p><ul><li>Liberate the planet Bore Rock, where Tyranny Park 2 will be built.</li><li>Kill 5 million Chargers, 2 million Impalers, and 1.5 million Bile Titans.</li><li>Extract 40 million common samples from any Terminid-controlled planet.</li><li>Additionally extract another 15 million rare samples from any Terminid-controlled planet.</li></ul><p>Only then will mankind's greatest "recreational and education facility showcasing the most dire threats posed to Managed Democracy" be built.</p><p>The Twitter post announcing the major order is clearly having a ball invoking the park's continued parallels to the Jurassic Park series, where everything famously goes awry and the entrapped dinosaurs <em>always </em>wind up going on a rampage. It even calls back to the first Tyranny Park, which was the focus of an earlier Helldivers 2 initiative some months ago, citing its failure as a "tragic sabotage" whose lessons and victims will not be forgotten. I don't see how any of this could possibly go wrong.</p><p>This major order comes just as Helldivers 2 inches closer to its August 26 release on Xbox systems. Most recently, it's even begun to look like the developers are teasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-teases-halo-3-odst-crossover-ahead-of-its-xbox-launch/1100-6533858/" data-ref-id="1100-6533858">crossover with Halo 3: ODST</a> to celebrate the launch. It sounds to me like between this crossover and Tyranny Park 2, Helldivers 2 players will have a lot going on in the weeks to come.</p>

                <p>Superstar Mode has returned in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675129">Madden NFL 26</a>, and it allows you to create your own player and go through the entire NFL experience. This includes the entire pre-draft process, which culminates with getting drafted by one of the 32 NFL teams. However, before you can get drafted, you need to participate in the NFL Combine. The Combine is meant to be a complete evaluation of you as a player, but it's not just your physical traits being tested. There's also a Combine interview where teams will ask you a series of questions, and you need to provide the correct answers.</p><p>While you can try to complete the interview by yourself, we have provided a list of every question and answer for the NFL Combine in the guide below. This lets you completely ace the test and get drafted highly in Madden 26's Superstar Mode.</p><h2>All NFL Combine answers in Madden 26</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549289"></a><figcaption>Superstar Mode allows you to take over the NFL in Madden 26, and that starts at the Combine.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4549289-madden-nfl-26-gets-a-gameplay-deep-dive-cover68527b9d4f88a.jpg"></figure><p>In total, there are six questions you can be asked during the NFL Combine interview, but some of the questions are only for certain positions. You'll be asked five general questions plus a position-specific question for a total of six.</p><p>You also have a choice when it comes to your answers to the questions; specific answers will result in receiving different boosts and rewards in Superstar Mode.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was the series' long-anticipated trip to Japan, but it also made some significant changes to the series. Most notable for longtime fans was the absence of "social stealth," a series mainstay that allows your assassin to blend in with a crowd. But Ubisoft says it had good reason for the change, and reassured fans that social stealth could make a comeback.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/comment/n8bf6t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit AMA</a>, a trio of Ubisoft developers addressed a fan who asked about social stealth elements.</p><p>"For Shadows, our stealth team chose to put 100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience, which left no space for Social Stealth," they said. "Tthat [sic] does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin's Creed franchise, though!"</p><p>Traditionally in an Assassin's Creed game, if a guard gives chase you could lose their sight line and then blend in with a group or sit on a bench to throw them off. In Shadows, however, the shinobi character Naoe would need to find cover or use her rope to climb out of sight to evade capture, rather than just duck behind a corner and look like she's minding her own business. That was only half the equation, too, as the game also featured a samurai character, Yasuke, who was functionally a walking tank. His massive size and ornate armor means he wouldn't exactly be inconspicuous in a crowd.</p><p>The last game before Shadows, Assassin's Creed Mirage, was an explicit throwback to the series' roots, including the setting and some older gameplay elements. It included the social stealth as usual, so it has been in recent memory for the Assassin's Creed series. The next Assassin's Creed game that we know of is codenamed Assassin's Creed Hexe--which may or may not be the final title--and it's reportedly set in 16th century Europe. As the name implies, it focuses on witchcraft and even lets you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-hexe-will-let-you-possess-and-control-a-cat-report/1100-6522899/" data-ref-id="1100-6522899">possess a cat</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A new hide-and-seek online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will have a pretty big drawback: no cross-play support. That means players can't face off unless they're on the same platform. The remake of the PlayStation 2 classic is slated for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Konami confirmed the lack of cross-play for Metal Gear Solid Delta <a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>, with GameSpot verifying the translation. While the game launches later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-will-add-a-hide-and-seek-based-multiplayer-mode-this-fall/1100-6533794/">Fox Hunt isn't set to arrive until this fall</a>. The multiplayer mode will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">share elements with 2008's Metal Gear Online</a> but is completely original.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox Hunt won't be the only additional activity alongside the main campaign. Metal Gear Solid Delta will also feature Snake Vs. Monkey on PC and PS5 (which was part of the original Metal Gear Solid 3) and Snake Vs. Bomberman on Xbox Series X|S (which is a new mode). The game is set to come out August 28, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorder-restock-guide/1100-6524133/">the collector's edition recently restocked</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/">Hideo Kojima was asked whether he would check out the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Official Bring the Boom Trailer (With Halo ODST Teaser) | Out August 26</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, the signal seems familiar but doesn't quite sound like anything from Halo. However, when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1moadmj/clip_comparing_a_segment_of_the_reversed_signal/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-grunts-think-theyve-found-more-evidence-of-a-halo-crossover-thanks-to-a-very-familiar-unknown-signal-detected-by-the-galactic-warning-system-is-that-the-superintendent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signal's audio</a> is reversed, it sounds almost identical to the phone alarm for the AI Superintendent from Halo 3: ODST. It's that alarm which helps guide ODST's Rookie through the embattled streets of New Mombasa following a Covenant invasion. Is the Superintendent now trying to warn Helldivers of a coming threat?</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Arrowhead Studios hasn't said anything official about a Halo crossover just yet, but Halo's ODSTs and Super Earth's Helldivers are so similar that it would be a crime against Managed Democracy if a collaboration didn't happen. What all the crossover will entail is still anybody's guess, but there will almost certainly be ODST cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as was the case when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-first-crossover-is-officially-killzone-2-and-the-dlc-is-out-now/1100-6528541/" data-ref-id="1100-6528541">Helldivers 2 crossed over with Sony's Killzone</a> franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani gave credit to publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">Sony for deciding to release Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a>, stating to a fan on Discord that the choice was "all PlayStation" but that Arrowhead was "all in support of course." Helldivers 2's most recent Control Group Warbond introduced some new experimental tech for players to test out, including a mini-teleportation device and a gun with seven-barrels that can be more than a little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/be-careful-firing-helldivers-2s-new-weapon-if-you-have-a-lot-of-ammo/2900-6760/" data-ref-id="2900-6760">dangerous if you have a lot of ammo</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tekken is a mainstay of the Evo tournament series--and of the entire fighting game genre. But things haven't been entirely rosy at the King of Iron Fist tournament lately. Despite very strong sales for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a>, many competitive players have expressed a dislike for the changes to characters and overall gameplay introduced in Season 2, and they've been very vocal about it on social media. Knowing that things are a bit stormy around Tekken 8's competitive scene lately, I went into an interview with members of the Tekken team at Evo to ask questions about their upcoming content plans, how to deal with criticism, revisiting past games, and the impending return of their number one 3D fighting game rival.</p><p dir="ltr">As the session began, I was shown the trailer for Armor King by director Kohei Ikeda, often referred to by players and staff as Nakatsu. Armor King is a classic returning character, with appearances going back to the very first Tekken. He leans heavily into the "heel" wrestling persona, with a black, spikey outfit and an offense-oriented skillset with a new stance called Bad Jaguar. He can even make the stage floor crumble when performing his rage art.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tekken 8 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I noticed that when Armor King's attacks hit the opponent, there's a brief flash of the Japanese kanji "aku" (悪), meaning evil. "You're the first person to notice that," Tekken designer and interpreter Michael Murray said. "It's there because Armor King's classic costume used to feature that kanji prominently."</p><p dir="ltr">These kinds of character details have become increasingly important in Tekken 8. "In the past, we [included] lots of character details, such as Kazuya being a sneaker collector," Murray said. "But over time, we kind of stopped doing it. Then the fans were like, 'Why? We used to love those kinds of details.' So we tried to bring that back for Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">I then got to see the debut of the all-new character, Miary Zo. Miary hails from the African island of Madagascar and fights using traditional African martial arts. Tekken Project producer and series veteran Katsuhiro Harada wanted to emphasize that they did their homework when they decided to design the series' first African character. "Makatsu [Ikeda] and I actually went to Madagascar for research. We were able to connect with not just the local fighting game community, but also different groups of people. One thing we learned is that Madagascar's place in the African region is quite unique in how it came about, with its people and its culture located off the coast of the African continent.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So what we found out was that their roots come from Southeast Asia as well as the main continent. The people of Madagascar have a different look to them than those of the African mainland, like with skin color and hairstyles. For example, we noticed a lot more people in Madagascar had straight hair, especially women."</p><p dir="ltr">The pursuit of authenticity had some unexpected challenges. "When we were trying to do the voiceovers, we learned that there's no established industry in Madagascar for voice recording, it's mainly a few people who sometimes do dubs for TV shows in the local language. So to find a voice actor for Miary Zo, we actually had to look for young folks who wanted to be voice actors. We did several rounds of auditions to find the person who was adequate for this task. But then also once we found them, recording at the studio itself was tough, because there's many power outages throughout the day. So actually finishing the recording was quite a challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">After this new character introduction, I felt that it was time to address the elephant in the room: How was the team responding to criticism of Tekken 8's Season 2? "We had a lot of new people on the team," Harada explained. "I'm actually fairly conservative when it comes to game design. I usually wouldn't make huge changes, but with Tekken 8, I do feel like our team successfully created something unique and new. When the game launched, players loved it. It had a 90 Metacritic and won Best Fighting Game at The Game Awards. But this was before Season 1 ended.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That being said, we realized that a portion of the Tekken fanbase is also very conservative. Many people would perhaps want to see something closer to Tekken 7, for example. But then that's very hard to tell from the outside, because you have all these strong opinions on the internet. Then you have other people who just joined from Tekken 8, who don't know anything about Tekken and are enjoying themselves. Even though there may be a conflict between those opinions, we don't want to make them fight against each other about what's proper Tekken."</p><p dir="ltr">"We had this brand-new game in Tekken 8, and we were trying to make it feel even more different and new in Season 2," Harada continued. "So some people liked it, and some people didn't. We're trying to continue to monitor the community and to have a discussion with them to find a middle ground that everyone can enjoy--whether you were a series fan, a fan of Tekken 7 in particular, or whether you like the new systems in Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, with social media being what it is, it's easy to get overwhelmed with negativity and hate-baiting clout farming. How does the team separate signal from noise? "It's difficult," Harada admitted. "Social media is actually a good way to collect information for Tekken development. It's also important to come to events like Evo or Comic-Con, though. I can hear the opinions of people who compete in tournaments--sometimes I hear opinions different from what the pro players are saying. At an event like Comic-Con, I can talk to fans who are less engaged in the competitive side of things."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1829681286" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

I keep an open mind and remember it's not a personal attack. It feels like it is sometimes. But I take the data and try to get to what they're saying, then lay it on the table with Nakatsu. We look it over and say, 'Okay, what represents most of our gaming population? What would make the most people happy?' rather than worrying about what people are trying to do on social media."</p><p dir="ltr">"I do listen to negative opinions, but I only think of it as one person's opinion," Harada continued. But online media can have the effect of making that negativity seem bigger than it is. When you're listening to all these different people, are they saying what they're really believing, or are they just echoing the sentiment of some other person that they heard? Also, some people who are unhappy with something voice that opinion, but others just leave without saying anything. On the other hand, there are people that are happy with the current state of Tekken 8, and they keep playing the game, but we don't hear from them either, because they're not vocal about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Murray chimed in with his own anecdote: "Harada often told us a story about developing around the Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament era. The team wanted to make a new game, so they took all the stuff that people didn't like about Tekken at the time. The thinking was, 'If we get rid of those parts, then obviously everyone's going to love the new game.' But that didn't work out. They came up with Tekken 4, which at the time was thought of as a strange version of Tekken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We use that as a lesson--that just taking things and limiting elements that people are complaining about doesn't necessarily make a good game. So that's why we're trying to be very careful in our evaluation of what people say about Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite online complaints, Tekken 8 continues to have a strong playerbase, though some players have decided they'd rather play older titles like Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection or Tekken Tag Tournament 2 instead. This isn't uncommon in the fighting game scene--if some players don't care for a new game, they'll often continue to play an older game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Harada if he'd consider putting together a compilation of older Tekken titles for these players. "It's a bit difficult," he replied. "It's a concept that's worked well for Capcom. Maybe popular sentiment has changed over time, but back when the subject of reissuing past Tekken titles came up, we did research about the concept's market viability. But 3D fighters--for example, Virtua Fighter and Tekken--have typically been showcases of the latest technology in gaming at that time. That's less the case with 2D fighting games. When we were looking at people in the 2D fighter audience, they would go back and play the older titles, whether that's Street Fighter II or Street Fighter III Third Strike, whatever. Maybe they wouldn't move to the latest game, or maybe they'd play both at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But with 3D fighters, the majority of people would always go to the latest installment, because it had the prettiest graphics and the best technology at the time. Not many people went back and played the older titles. And we noticed, in the console version of Tekken 5, we included the older iterations of the arcade versions for Tekken 1, 2, and 3. People would boot the games up and go, 'Oh yeah, I remember this!' And then they return to the main game. But maybe things have changed, and we need to revisit our thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">"Personally, as a business decision for the company, it makes sense to have someone port the games and repackage them," Harada continued. "But as a developer, it's not very entertaining to go back and recreate something I've already worked on. And there are other factors. For Tekken Tag 2 as an example, it's a game some of the hardcore Tekken fans really love. Makatsu and I both love it too. But when you look at the overall sales, it did even worse than Tekken 4. It almost killed the series. Sometimes, peoples' memory of something is much different than reality."</p><p dir="ltr">With a new Virtua Fighter game on the horizon, Tekken's most-prominent competition in the 3D fighting game arena has returned to the ring. Despite what many people think, however, the Tekken and Virtua Fighter teams are quite amicable towards one another, with Harada having frequently pushed publicly for a new Virtua Fighter game. With that in mind, I asked about his feelings seeing Virtua Fighter return after such a long time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"From an emotional viewpoint and also a business or company employee viewpoint, we've always had a friendly rivalry," said Harada. "For a while, it felt like the series stopped. People were resigned to not knowing when or if a new Virtua Fighter would release. For quite some time, even when Tekken became thought of as the longest, continuing 3D fighting game series, no one said, 'Hey, wait, there's Virtua Fighter.' Everyone seemed to feel that VF was done.</p><p dir="ltr">"I found it frustrating, because that left us as practically the only big name in 3D fighting. To have our rival just disappear and not be a vital part of the genre was maddening. I want them to come back, and quickly, because it's lonely here. We want other games like VF to be around, because they attract attention and bring people into 3D fighters."</p><p dir="ltr">To close out the interview, I asked Harada about his feelings on the current fighting game landscape. "There's a lot of people coming into the space in addition to these new, major fighting game titles. People talk about the '90s fighting game boom, but it ended kind of abruptly. But now everyone is back in full force. Sales of major franchises--Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat--all have done very well, not just for fighting games, but for video games in general. If you look at the competitors and viewers for Evo year over year, or even for our own Tekken World Tour, I think the fighting game boom is happening as we speak."</p>
