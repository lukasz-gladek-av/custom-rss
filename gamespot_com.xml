                <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new feature for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, and it's one you might not have expected: binoculars.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed on the Nintendo Today app, where Nintendo regularly posts bits of news, will feature stationary binoculars you can find in specific locations around the open world. In a short video, Mario is shown approaching the binoculars before being sent up into the air, where you can look around in a zoomed in first-person view. This was done in the desert area shown off in the reveal trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2, with looks at the diner, parts of the track, and a plane flying overhead.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo did not provide any insight into why you would use these, but based on known information about Mario Kart World ,it seems like the binoculars would be handy to spot secrets and other points of interest you might want to drive to. There are secrets to discover in the open-world of Mario Kart World, and without knowing how the locations are conveyed to you--if at all--this might be Nintendo's solution.</p><p>This also seems like a way for Nintendo to reveal more about Mario Kart World ahead of its launch on June 5, alongside the Nintendo Switch 2. The video is titled "Binocular View of the World #1" which implies that Nintendo will roll out a few more of these, revealing new looks at the different tracks in the game. Nintendo typically posts a single update on Nintendo Today each day, so these might be spaced out. If you want to know more about the Switch 2 ahead of its launch, check out GameSpot's round up of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/"> everything we know about the Switch 2</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid/" data-ref-id="5000-1362">Metal Gear Solid</a> creator Hideo Kojima is well-known for crafting games that speculate on what our collective future might entail. However, recent events have left the game director taking a deeper look at his own future, and what might become of Kojima Productions when dies.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936449/edge-magazine-subscription.thtml" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Edge Magazine</a> (later reported on by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-hes-left-staff-a-usb-stick-of-game-ideas-for-after-he-dies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>), Kojima said that falling "seriously ill" during the pandemic inspired him to re-evaluate his career ambitions and how much time he has left as a creator. After recovering, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/death-stranding-2-screenshots/2900-6560/" data-ref-id="2900-6560">Death Stranding 2</a> director made the decision to give a "USB stick with all my ideas on it" to his personal assistant as a way to ensure the studio has new ideas to toy around with after he is gone. Kojima likened the storage device to a "will" of sorts.</p><p>"Perhaps they could continue to make things after I’m gone at Kojima Productions… This is a fear for me: what happens to Kojima Productions after I’m gone? I don’t want them to just manage our existing IP," Kojima said.</p><p>The game director--who turns 62 this August--said that the pandemic was ultimately more of a turning point for him than entering his 60s. After falling ill and undergoing an eye operation, he was left unable to "create anything." At the same time, he witnessed "lost of people around me passing away."</p><p>"Until then, I didn’t think I was old, you know? I just didn’t feel my age, and I assumed I would be able to create for as long as I live," Kojima said. "But then I became sick, and I couldn’t create anything. And I saw lots of people around me passing away at that time. I was confronted with death. Of course, I recovered, but now I was thinking, 'Wait, how many years do I have left to make game or a film?' Perhaps I have 10 years?"</p><p>Kojima added, however, that he has since put his ambitions to direct a film aside. He credits directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn--both of whom appear in the Death Stranding series--for this decision, as both encouraged him to stick to video games.</p><p>Kojima Productions' next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, is now only a month away. The second-ever "Strand game" is scheduled to release exclusively for PlayStation 5 on June 26, though players who order the Collector's and Digital Deluxe Editions of the games will gain access starting on June 24. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/" data-ref-id="1100-6531384">preview</a> of the game, Dan Ryckert wrote that he can "confidentially say it's excellent."</p><p>"Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment. But when the game wants to get loud, it does not hold back. One chapter--titled 'Conflagration'--is one of the most visually stunning sequences I’ve ever seen in a game," Ryckert wrote. "Even running on a base PS5, it’s a spectacle that culminates in a boss encounter that rivals the best of Metal Gear Solid. Mechanically, it’s essentially a shootout with a boss and multiple soldiers, but tonally and visually, it’s Kojima firing on all cylinders and it’s truly jaw-dropping."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As hard as this may be to believe, Avowed--the first-person RPG from Obsidian Entertainment--has already been out for three months. Obsidian isn't resting on its laurels, however, as the studio has released a full roadmap for the rest of 2025 that includes some juicy additions to the open-world adventure.</p><p dir="ltr">The Spring update, Update 1.4, released today on Xbox and PC. It adds improvements to the map's fog of war mechanics, an Arachnophobia Safe Mode for players who hate spiders, and support for a mouse and keyboard control scheme on Xbox, among other things. Today's patch also allows players to wait at the Party Camp to pass in-game time, view chests on the minimap, or perform a new cancel ability with Bow and Arquebus power attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png" data-ref-id="1300-4495798"></a><figcaption>Avowed Roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4495798-avowed-roadmap-2025.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead to the rest of the year, the Summer patch will bring improvements to cooking and crafting, custom map markers, and new NPC abilities and behaviors throughout. The Fall update, meanwhile, will add New Game Plus, a Photo Mode, new character presets, and a new weapon type--though Obsidian's blog post on the roadmap doesn't go into specifics on what that new weapon type will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed launched in February to critical acclaim, as it currently sits at an 81 average score on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/avowed/">GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>. It was first announced in July 2020, during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-showcase-event-every-game-shown-from/1100-6479333/">Xbox's summer showcase</a> just before the launch of the Xbox Series X|S the following November.</p><p dir="ltr">Avowed is available now for Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

The full patch notes for the 1.3 update can be found on the <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-1-3" rel="nofollow ">official KCD2 website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.3 launches alongside Kingdom Come: Deliverance II's first paid DLC story expansion, Brushes With Death.

Blizzard additionally used the update to introduce a major quality-of-life change, one that it initially forgot to include in the official patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 2.2.1, released on May 14, added the ability to turn in Tree of Whisper bounties from any major city, with Ravens of the Tree now located in Cerrigar, Gea Kul, Ked Bardu, Kyovashad, Kurast, and Zarbinzet. It's actually a feature originally part of Season 7 that has now been added to the game permanently.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"This is a commonly requested feature from Season 7 that has been brought back into the game to help players save time on Whisper events," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said in a post on the Diablo 4 <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/patch-221-raven-of-the-trees-now-found-in-each-major-town/222502" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forums</a>. "This was originally missing from the patch notes, but we will be updating the notes to include this feature."</p><p dir="ltr">It might not sound like much, but being able to turn in Whisper bounties in major cities where players likely are already spending their time significantly speeds up the entire bounty running process. Instead of completing 10 bounties, having to navigate to the map, travel to the Tree of Whispers, turn in, and then teleport back to their previous location, players can simply travel to a nearby town and turn it in immediately, or wait for when they are already in town doing various other activities to do it then.</p><p dir="ltr">The feature has since been added to the official <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24196854/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> with a comment from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">"We recognized that backtracking to the tree to turn in Whispers made for a bloated gameplay loop," the patch notes read. "A Raven of the Tree was added to each capital city to cut down on turn in time."</p><p dir="ltr">As for other changes in the update, numerous Spiritborn skills and passives have received buffs, along with buffs for multiple Druid passives and some significant damage increases for Barbarian items like Ghor's Devastating Grips and Twin Strikes.</p><p dir="ltr">There have been a few season-specific improvements as well. The boss power Sinerat's Flame received a 25% damage buff, and Apparition Incursions are now both easier to find on the map and spawn Betraying Eyes, needed for some seasonal journey objectives, more consistently. For more details on what all is included in update 2.2.1, be sure to read the full patch notes.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 8 started April 29 and brought major, permanent changes to the ARPG's endgame bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">making them stronger but more rewarding</a>. Blizzard additionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/" data-ref-id="1100-6530937">reworked Diablo 4's battle pass system</a>, a change that, while better in some ways, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/" data-ref-id="1100-6531240">didn't exactly go over well with players</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Diablo 4 also crossed over with Berserk</a> for Season 8, and while there are some free rewards for players to earn, the crossover largely feels like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-berserk-crossover-is-a-huge-wasted-opportunity/1100-6531373/" data-ref-id="1100-6531373">huge wasted opportunity</a>.</p>

                <p>It’s been three years since Sony launched its popular <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM5 Headphones</a>, and today it’s officially launched its successor--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6</a>.

Early reviews are incredibly positive, with critics pointing out the headphones impeccable noise-canceling skills and ultra-comfortable design.</p><div title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3524" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6503414 - Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Headphones" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony WH-1000XM6 - Noise-Canceling Wireless Headphones</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$448 at Amazon | $450 at Best Buy</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony made two big upgrades with these new headphones. First and foremost is the new noise-cancelling processor. The QN3 is said to be seven times faster than the processor found in the XM5, resulting in enhanced active noise cancellation. Using 12 microphones, it can sense and react to noises in your environment, quickly adapting its performance to reduce ambient sound.</p><p>The other big addition is a folding design. Sony abandoned this with the XM5, and while the folding system isn’t identical to the older XM4, the end result is the same. Thanks to metal joints, you can swivel and fold the earcups, making them easy to transport in the included carrying case.</p></div>                      </div><p>You’ll get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, a wider headband for added support and comfort, and a six-microphone system that picks up and transmits crisp audio for phone calls. Of course, it also benefits from enhanced drivers, which should provide clearer audio for all your content. The headphones are available in black, midnight blue, and silver.</p><p>If you’re looking to upgrade your audio but don’t want to drop $450, both the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Canceling-Headphones-Hands-Free/dp/B09XS7JWHH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">XM4</a> headphones are currently on sale. The XM5 are $348 (was $400) and the XM4 are $298 (was $348). The XM5 offer superior noise-canceling chops compared to the XM4--but they lack the ability to fold, making them a bit more cumbersome for travel or storage. The XM4 are also on sale for $50 off, though audio quality and ANC aren’t quite up to par with the newer XM5.</p><p>The XM6 essentially combines the best aspects of both headphones while also improving overall performance. Be sure to give all three a look before deciding which is best for your needs.
