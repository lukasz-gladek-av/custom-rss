                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> came out of the gate earlier this month with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-internet-reacts-to-ps5-pros-700-price-tag/1100-6526397/" data-ref-id="1100-6526397">$700 price tag</a> and a list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" data-ref-id="2900-5758">PS5 Pro-enhanced game</a> that was supposed to offer early adapters a peak gaming experience. However, players soon reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-fear-itself/1900-6418060/" data-ref-id="1900-6418060">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, and other games actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-owners-say-some-games-look-worse-after-upgrades/1100-6527847/" data-ref-id="1100-6527847">looked worse on PS5 Pro</a>. Now, Konami and developer Bloober Team have addressed the issues on a new patch for Silent Hill 2.</p><p>Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1.06 patch</a> wasn't just created for the PS5 Pro problems. It's also adjusting and fixing a few issues with the PC version on Steam, but the PS5 Pro fixes are the highlight here. Prior to this update, Silent Hill 2 players on PS5 Pro noticed a number of glitches and visual distortions that weren't happening to the game on standard PlayStation 5 consoles.</p><p>Ironically, this is not the first time a Silent Hill 2 update has led to more problems than fixes. Silent Hill 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-patch-improves-steam-deck-performance-fixes-ps5-crashes/1100-6527293/">1.04 patch was intended to improve the game's performance on Steam</a> and cut down on crashes on PS5. Unfortunately, it also introduced a few game-breaking bugs that were meant to be dealt with as of the 1.05 patch. But that's when players noticed the issues with the game's performance on PS5 Pro.</p><p>To the credit of Konami and Bloober Team, the new patches have been released relatively quickly. Hopefully any future issues will also be addressed in a speedy manner. Given the early difficulties that some developers have had with PS5 Pro-enhanced games, it's not shocking that CD Projekt Red decided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-pro-patch-not-happening-dev-confirms/1100-6527915/" data-ref-id="1100-6527915">not to create a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for Cyberpunk 2077</a> anytime soon.</p><p>The full notes for Silent Hill 2's 1.06 patch are included below.</p><h3>PLAYSTATION 5</h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed a bug regarding trophy counting</li><li>Fixed some graphics glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul><h3><a title="Platforms > Steam [2,232 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/steam/" rel="nofollow ">STEAM</a></h3><h4>TECHNOLOGY</h4><ul><li>Fixed an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration</li><li>Improved mouse sensitivity range and value interval</li><li>Fixed a bug related to mouse input</li><li>Fixed a bug when using a controller</li></ul><h4>GAMEPLAY</h4><ul><li>Fixed door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map</li><li>Improved traversal spots and fixed an issue where enemies could get stuck</li><li>Fixed an audio glitch in the bull section of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed minor blocker in Labyrinth (player was unable to exit either side of the Labyrinth after obtaining the map)</li><li>Fixed map marker for boar lot in Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed map marker west of Southvale</li><li>Fixed a bug with Maria’s navigation</li><li>Fixed an issue where some of Maria’s lines would occur multiple times.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the final boss was missing and a movement bug</li><li>Fixed an issue where mannequins would get stuck in ambush mode</li><li>Fixed interactions with items that were difficult to obtain</li><li>Improved boss animations</li><li>Added a guide for picking up the plate in the final puzzle of Toluca Prison</li><li>Fixed a translation issue when changing difficulty during gameplay</li><li>Fixed wall animation during Abstract Daddy fight based on user feedback</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would not progress after a cutscene when using low FPS.</li><li>Fixed a progression-blocking issue at Brookhaven Hospital</li><li>Fixed some issues with lights in Southvale East at night.</li><li>Fixed an issue with the mannequin’s physics</li><li>Fixed other minor issues with objects, collision detection, typos, lighting, drawing, and loading.</li></ul>
