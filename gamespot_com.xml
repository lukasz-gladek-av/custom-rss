With the release of any new 2K title, the developers offer Locker Codes, which can be utilized to earn a variety of cosmetics, currency, and other rewards.</p><p>These Locker Codes are completely free to redeem. However, most of them are only active for a limited time, so you have to act quickly if you want to secure the rewards they offer. You also need to know what the Locker Codes themselves are and how to redeem them. Otherwise, all you'll be doing is surfing the various menus in 2K26, trying to figure out what the codes are.</p><p>Below, you can see every active Locker Code in NBA 2K26 and how to redeem them in-game.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#All_active_NBA_2K26_Locker_Codes">All active NBA 2K26 Locker Codes</a><ul><li><a href="#New_NBA_2K26_Locker_Codes">New NBA 2K26 Locker Codes</a></li><li><a href="#Expired_NBA_2K26_Locker_Codes">Expired NBA 2K26 Locker Codes</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#How_to_redeem_NBA_2K26_Locker_Codes">How to redeem NBA 2K26 Locker Codes</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_earn_more_free_code_rewards_in_NBA_2K26">How to earn more free code rewards in NBA 2K26</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="All_active_NBA_2K26_Locker_Codes">All active NBA 2K26 Locker Codes</h2><p>The Locker Codes in 2K26 usually stay active for weeks or even months at a time, so you're not immediately under the gun to redeem them. However, the codes can expire at a moment's notice, so if you want the rewards from them, it's best to go through the redemption process as soon as you see an active code.</p><p>We have tested all of the Locker Codes in 2K26 as of early September to confirm they're working in-game.

                <p>Nintendo's star heroine wasn't always named Princess Peach, and for many years prior to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> went by a different name: Princess Toadstool. Now, fans know the reason why, and it wasn't because of any decision Nintendo made.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo veteran Leslie Swan, who over the course of her nearly three-decade career helped localize countless Nintendo classics, wrote for Nintendo Power magazine, and even voiced Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, spilled the beans on the unlikely origin of the Toadstool moniker. She said in Nintendo's early days, there wasn't a lot of communication between the development teams in Japan and those working on marketing in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">"So on Super Mario Bros. they [Nintendo] had outsourced the production of the manual to an ad agency," Swan said. "And the ad agency just kind of created names for things. And so they're the ones who came up with Princess Toadstool as the name for Peach."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ad agency's decision, the name stuck for the next decade. Swan said when localizing Super Mario 64 for North America alongside Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Miyamoto was fond of the "Peach" name and wanted it included.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743"></a><figcaption>Princess Peach's letter to Mario in Super Mario 64.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Swan suggested combining the two names together for the US release. Peach could be Princess Toadstool's more "informal" name, Swan said. It's for that reason Peach's letter to Mario at the beginning of Super Mario 64 is signed Princess Toadstool, with "Peach" handwritten in pink.</p><p dir="ltr">The full interview includes tons more details about Swan's career and is well worth a read. Meanwhile, Princess Peach has come into her own in recent years, stepping out of Mario's shadow. Far from a damsel in distress, she proved to be a major force in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-was-the-most-profitable-film-of-2023/1100-6523224/" data-ref-id="1100-6523224">Super Mario. Bros movie</a> and even received her own game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/princess-peach-showtime/" data-ref-id="5000-591679">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, in 2024, the first game to star her as the main protagonist since 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-princess-peach/" data-ref-id="5000-22936">Super Princess Peach</a> for Nintendo DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Peach is making a name for herself, her relationship with Mario is more complicated than ever, with Nintendo recently going out of its way to remind fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-really-wants-you-to-know-mario-and-peach-are-just-good-friends/1100-6533462/" data-ref-id="1100-6533462">Mario and Princess Peach are just "good friends."</a></p>

                <p>In 2014, Machine Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review/1900-6415765/" data-ref-id="1900-6415765">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> rebooted the classic Wolfenstein shooter from id Software. The sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-review/1900-6416796/" data-ref-id="1900-6416796">Wolfenstein: The New Colossus</a>, followed in 2017, with a spin-off called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-youngblood-nintendo-switch-review/1900-6417260/" data-ref-id="1900-6417260">Wolfenstein: Youngblood</a> in 2019. There hasn't been a new game in the franchise since the VR title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-cyberpilot-review-falling-short/1900-6417264/" data-ref-id="1900-6417264">Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</a> in 2019, but Machine Games creative director Axel Torvenius still wants to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," said Torvenius during a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While there's currently no word about a third Wolfenstein game, Amazon is reportedly developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">a Wolfenstein TV series for Prime Video</a>. Kilter Films--one of the production companies behind Prime Video's Fallout series--is producing the show alongside Machine Games. Plot details are currently undisclosed, but it's believed to be based on the reboot's storyline.</p><p>Machine Games is now owned by Microsoft as part of the ZeniMax acquisition. The studio's most recent title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which continued Wolfenstein's Nazi-fighting tradition. The first DLC expansion for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-order-of-giants-looks-like-the-best-of-the-great-circle-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-too/1100-6534094/" data-ref-id="1100-6534094">Indiana Jones And The Order Of Giants</a>, was released earlier this month. Machine Games and Bethesda will also port Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to Switch 2 in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax. Hines is now retired, but he's continued to share his opinions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">how he feels about Xbox Game Pass. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
