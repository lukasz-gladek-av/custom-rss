                <p>Sony is feeling blue — but in a good way — as the company has just revealed a new limited-edition DualSense controller. The Icon Blue Special Edition gives the peripheral a striking makeover, wrapping it in layered shades of blue, and it'll be available to preorder exclusively from Walmart for $85 when it goes on sale starting October 20.</p><p>The peripheral's colorway is inspired by the signature blue glow of the PS5 consoles when it's powered on, and according to Sony designer Leo Cardoso, the design is meant to capture the "feeling of anticipation and wonder" whenever you boot up the console. Other small touches include Katakana characters on the back and PlayStation shapes on the D-pad.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581938"></a><figcaption>Icon Blue DualSense controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581938-dualsenseblue%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4581939,1300-4581940,1300-4581941" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581939-dualsenseblue%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581940-dualsenseblue%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4581941-dualsenseblue%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking for a different type of design, you can grab limited edition DualSense controllers inspired by two of the biggest PS5 exclusives of the year, as well as one of the company's beloved franchises. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-dualsense-controller-revealed/1100-6535002/">God of War 20th Anniversary DualSense controller</a> was recently revealed, and the design is directly inspired by Kratos' omega tattoo. Preorders for it are live ahead of its release on October 23, and it's priced at $85.</p><p>Sony still has stock of the $85 Death Stranding 2: On the Beach DualSense, which features a selection of black colors, subtle orange accents, and iconography inspired by one of the organizations present in the game, Drawbridge. The collector's edition for the game is also still in stock, while the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F19GPDW3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard edition has been discounted to $50</a>.</p><p>The complete opposite of the Death Stranding 2 option is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-ps5-console-bundles-and-dualsense-are-up-for-preorder/1100-6534326/">Ghost of Yotei DualSense controller</a> that launched alongside the game. Instead of sci-fi graphic design and dark colors, this one features elegant inkbrush art inspired by the game. The Ghost of Yotei PS5 controller is available in gold or black colors for $85.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-history-book-announced-preorders-available-now/1100-6535087/">A PlayStation 30th Anniversary book has also been announced</a>, and it's currently scheduled to ship out in 2026. The 400-page hardcover book aims to be the definitive visual chronicle of the console, and inside you'll find unseen images from Sony's archive of research and development materials alongside insights from the people who designed the console.</p><p>As part of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F19GPDW3,B0CTVK7GBM,B0CPYSPHR1,B0C7WQRCPB,B08QFWWJ8K,B095T8C99C,B0B61YDF5V,B09SW6GCGL,B0B3QWRQL8,B0CP4DCK45,B08FC5TTBF,B08QFPS48J,B0DWYP2PXP,B09Z7JZW4P,B09RDRYF8L,B0CK4VWNYL,B0DD8TMP2Y,B098G34GBT,B0DJDLS8Q1,B0DWB7452C,B0DW9NNBRC,B08QFZCGVJ&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Studios publisher sale</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Big Deal Days</a>, you can also get several other games at a discounted price, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stellar-Blade-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CTVK7GBM?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MARVELS-SPIDER-MAN-2-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0C7WQRCPB?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-Directors-Cut-PlayStation-5/dp/B098G34GBT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ghost of Tsushima: Director's Cut</a>.</p>
