                <p>Rockstar Games has pushed back against the claims that a group of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">recently laid-off developers were removed for trying to unionize</a>. Instead, these people were leaking company secrets, Rockstar said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Rockstar told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> that the staffers were "distributing and discussing confidential information in a public form." This violated Rockstar's policies, the company said. "This was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>Between 30 and 40 people were fired from Rockstar's offices in Canada and the UK related to what the developer labeled "gross misconduct." A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said Rockstar is guilty of "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The union said the affected staffers sent messages within a "private trade union chat group" on Discord. The union acknowledged that outsiders were in the chat, too, but they were labor organizers.</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>In 2022, Rockstar suffered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-leak-was-really-frustrating-and-upsetting-take-two-says/1100-6511236/" data-ref-id="1100-6511236">massive leak that revealed the first footage and details about GTA 6</a>. When Rockstar ordered staff back to the office in 2024, the company cited security concerns as one of the reasons for calling staff back. The union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-reportedly-now-in-final-stages-of-development-as-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-plans/1100-6521477/" data-ref-id="1100-6521477">opposed this directive at the time.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is Rockstar's next big release, and it's set to launch in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Rockstar's owner, Take-Two, will release its next earnings report today, November 6, at which time the company is expected to communicate more about GTA 6, or at least re-confirm the release date.</p><p>In addition to GTA 6, it's rumored that Rockstar is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">developing PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2 versions of Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> could happen as well.</p>

                <p>The smartphone in your pocket can be a surprisingly versatile gaming device, but admittedly, touchscreen controls aren't the best. Fortunately, there's a wide range of accessories that you can equip to your phone, <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">and this new magnetic case from MCon</a> looks like it'll hit the Goldilocks zone for functionality and compact design. Now available to preorder for $145 (was $150), the MCon is designed to fit "most" phones using its magnetic clamps.</p><div title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4894" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535984 -- MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">MCon Magnetic Smartphone Gaming Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/ohsnap.com\/products\/mcon-magnetic-controller&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://ohsnap.com/products/mcon-magnetic-controller">$145 (was $150)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>In addition to being a pocket-friendly device, the MCon features some high-end technology inside it. It has deployable grips for ergonomic comfort, Hall-Effect analog triggers, GameSir anti-stick drift joysticks, and a built-in gyroscope for motion controls. Another cool feature with this controller is that it has a button-activated slider that raises your phone into playing position with a single smooth motion. Kickback Mode allows you to remove the control cover and prop your phone up for tabletop play.</p><p>The controller also supports games that are played in Portrait Mode, and it features all the inputs you'd expect for modern-day gaming. The device also has silent face buttons, and it attaches to your phone with two magnetic pucks to keep your camera bumps away from the controller, ensuring a level fit. When not in use, the MCon measures just 5.67 inches long, 2.67 inches wide, and under three-quarters of an inch thick, to make it easy to store in your pocket. It's available to preorder in white or black.</p></div>                      </div><p>The MCon was originally funded through a Kickstarter campaign that blew past its initial funding goal of $25,000, earning over $1.7 million in crowdfunding. Part of the appeal for the device is that it has a user-friendly design, as manufacturer Oh Snap designed it to be moddable, upgradeable, and repairable. Smartphone controllers have become popular over the last couple of years, thanks in part to subscription services like Netflix and Crunchyroll offering a library of games for members to access, and there are several brands out there that offer high-quality add-ons like this.</p><p>One of the biggest is Backbone, as it currently sells controllers that are also portable and make mobile gaming a more pleasant experience. The company recently announced a collaboration with Hideo Kojima's studio to produce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-new-death-stranding-2-controller-looks-like-it-came-straight-from-the-games-world/1100-6535766/" data-ref-id="1100-6535766">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Backbone controller</a>, but if you're in a rush, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One with a USB-C connection</a> is available for $100, and for older iPhones, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Backbone One with a Lightning connection</a> is available at the same price.</p><p>The Backbone Ones have a solid design, but if you're looking for a more premium controller with better parts inside, the company's premium smartphone controller--the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone Pro</a>--is worth considering, with Hall Effect triggers, quiet face buttons, and full-sized ALPS analog sticks.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller On Sale For Lowest Price This Year</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>
