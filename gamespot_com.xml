                <p>That's the sound of sizzle-ing coming to Minecraft. Jack Black's earworm "Lava Chicken" from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecaft Movie</a> has officially been adapted into the game.

So, how do you get it? Players need to find and defeat a chicken jockey in the game (another part of the movie that became instantly memetic). However, if there are no chickens around, a spawned zombie has a 0.25% chance of being a chicken jockey; if there are chickens around, this is bumped to 0.4875% (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/minecraft-says-to-hell-with-it-adds-in-game-version-of-lava-chicken-song-which-you-get-by-beating-a-chicken-jockey/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41O_MydqxTU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/41O_MydqxTU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>At 34 seconds, Jack Black's song from A Minecraft Movie became the shortest ever to crack the Billboard Hot 100 over the summer--a record previously held by, well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bowsers-ballad-peaches-from-the-super-mario-bros-movie-cracks-billboard-hot-100/1100-6513350/" data-ref-id="1100-6513350">Jack Black for "Peaches"</a> on the Super Mario Bros.

This particular scene struck a chord with younger audiences, sparking a viral trend across theaters. Kids would enthusiastically shout "chicken jockey" at the screen during the scene, turning screenings into near-chaotic events.</p><p>In some instances, the excitement escalated to the point where theater staff had to call the police to restore order.

                <p dir="ltr">Typically, when a live-service game is shut down by its publisher, the assumption is the game failed to perform in some way--usually financially--and that its underwhelming performance resulted in its discontinuation. Star Wars Hunters--Zynga's multiplayer shooter set in the Star Wars universe--is being shut down in October, but despite a lower-than-anticipated attach rate, Zynga CEO Frank Gibeau says it was "no failure" at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/star-wars-hunters-was-no-failure" rel="nofollow ">The Game Business</a>, Gibeau said that the team at Zynga built a "great tech base" and a "fun game" with Hunters, but the game did not emerge as a "viable business." Specifically, Gibeau cites a lack of "organic installs from the license" as a contributing factor in its imminent discontinuation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="750" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4533070"></a><figcaption>Star Wars Hunters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4533070-hunters.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We had some issues with how we could explore the intellectual property--could you play Darth Vader or could you not? That sort of thing," Gibeau said. "We ended up with a cross-platform game on Switch and mobile that ran perfectly. It was fun. But it didn't engage over the long term. And it wasn't a viable business."</p><p dir="ltr">Gibeau also says that ending Hunters will result in another "shot on goal" with another IP, only now with the knowledge and technical base. "The action shooter category on mobile is very large and growing, and we'd like to be there," Gibeau said. "Now we have an Unreal tech base, with some great leads in terms of the engineering, developers and designersâ€¦. Now it's taking the learnings from Star Wars Hunters and applying it to another shot on goal with another intellectual property."</p><p dir="ltr">Zynga first announced Star Wars Hunters during a Nintendo Direct presentation in February 2021. It finally launched in June 2024, only for Zynga to announce that the game would cease operations on October 1, 2025--with one final update pushed to all users on April 15. A PC port of the game was also canceled.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Hunters is still available now for mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">To say Dead Island 2's development was rocky is probably an understatement. The action-RPG took nine years from reveal to launch and went through multiple studios in the process. Now, former Deep Silver head of communications Martin Wein has revealed part of what happened after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-dead-island-2-revealed-at-sony-press-conference/1100-6420278/">the sequel was unveiled at Sony's E3 2014 press conference</a>. Basically, the game as it existed then "sucked," he said.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/it-would-have-killed-the-franchise-insights-into-the-scrapped-2014-version-of-dead-island-2" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a> reports that Wein opened up about Dead Island 2 at a Develop:Brighton panel when he was asked whether he could remember a time when marketing or player research assisted in game development. "I can actually give you an example where myself and the product team caused about an eight-year product delay," said Wein.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Now with GameFlex Consultants, Wein stated that he and his team "were mightily proud" of Dead Island 2's reveal trailer--seen above. The video sees a jogger going for a run on the beachfront before turning into a zombie himself. About a month after the trailer's debut, Wein said that "we had a major milestone with the development studio that was in charge at that time. And boy, that game sucked."</p><p dir="ltr">At that time, Spec Ops: The Line developer Yager was working on Dead Island 2 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-loses-its-developer/1100-6428894/">before being removed in 2015</a>. Wein stated that the game back then "had nothing to do with what [made] the original Dead Island [...] really fun." Wein added that they received "horrific feedback" from a playtest, which the studio claimed it would address. But that didn't happen, according to Wein. This set off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2-has-been-delayed-again/1100-6509232/">a chain of delays for Dead Island 2</a>, and ultimately the game went through another developer in Sumo Digital before Dambuster Studios delivered the final product.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes you have to make hard decisions," Wein said. "Because we could have, at that point, put out a shit game. It might have made some money, but it would have killed the franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">In 2019, Koch Media made a similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-island-2s-long-development-is-a-good-sign-pub/1100-6471576/">argument for Dead Island 2's long development being a good thing</a>. The sequel finally arrived in 2023 and sold over 3 million copies.

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has teased plans to add more content to Fallout 76 based on the Prime Video TV series. Creative director Jon Rush said in an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/fallout-season-2-fishing-tips-video-game-76-1236451304/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the game studio and TV teams are in discussion "all the time," but it's too soon to say what specific content may be in the works.</p><p>"Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it's stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there. I'm not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another," Rush said.</p><p>While there may be opportunities for crossover content, Rush pointed out that Fallout 76's story is the furthest back in time for the series and the TV show is the furthest into the future. "So there's a lot of room where we don't necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories ,that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple," Rush said.</p><p>Fallout 76's Season 21 update launched in June, and the introduction of fishing was its biggest draw.
