                <p>The next game in the Plague Tale series was unveiled during the Xbox Games Showcase, with the cinematic reveal trailer showing off a new direction for the series. Developed by Asobo Studio, Resonance: A Plague Tale Story is set 15 years before the events of the previous game, Requiem, and it stars a new protagonist named Sophia.</p><p>Described as a plunderer who is on the run and determined to uncover the secrets of her past, Sophia's journey takes her to Minotaur's Island, where she has to face deadly trials and solve puzzles if she wants to stay one step ahead of the army chasing her. Asobo Studios says that it aimed to blend "combat, myth, and fate" together to create a new take on the universe of A Plague Tale, resulting in a heavier emphasis on action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfssswW0qf4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lfssswW0qf4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We wanted to expand and explore the world of A Plague Tale with a character--Sophia--that is very close to our heart, but within a much more action-oriented experience," Asobo Studios chief creative officer David Dedeine said in a press release. "This fresh approach comes with intuitive and rewarding combats, as well as a brand-new manifestation of the Macula, the ancient evil. Resonance embraces themes, places and eras that we had never explored before."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508872" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508872"></a><figcaption>Resonance: A Plague Tale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4508872-resonance-pt.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4508877,1300-4508876,1300-4508875,1300-4508874,1300-4508873" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508877-resonance-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508876-resonance-5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508875-resonance-4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508874-resonance-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4508873-resonance-1.jpg"></figure><p>Players will shift between the Middle Ages period of Sophia and ancient Minoan times on their journey, with actions taken in the past having an impact on Sophia's present, and similar to the myth of the Minotaur, Asobo Studio has hinted that a "restless presence" will be stalking Sophia.</p><p>Resonance: A Plague Tale will launch for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.

                <p>Goofy sci-fi first-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life/" data-ref-id="5000-566095">High on Life</a> is getting a sequel, and it looks like it'll include even more talking-alien weapons and more ridiculously bad outcomes for humanity. Indie developer Squanch Games announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/high-on-life-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681576">High on Life 2</a> with a new trailer at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>.</p><p>Check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UubdWIkj8Wc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UubdWIkj8Wc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the trailer, High on Life 2 is due for release in Winter 2025. It'll be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, and will be available on Xbox Game Pass at release.</p><p>The first High on Life found its human protagonist stuck in the middle of an alien invasion--it turns out that humans are an essential ingredient in drugs that a universe full of aliens really enjoys. Joined by weapons that can talk, you become a bounty hunter and set out to try to survive your new alien-filled reality, with mixed results.</p><p>The game was originally conceived by Justin Roiland, the creator of sci-fi animated comedy Rick and Morty and founder of Squanch Games, and High on Life's over-the-top comedy (and sometimes ludicrous gore) are pretty similar--if you're a fan of one, you're likely to enjoy the other. Roiland also lent his voice to the game.</p><p>Just what Roiland's involvement in High on Life 2 might be is unclear, though. He left the studio in 2023 after a former employee sued Squanch Games over accusations of sexual harassment and wrongful termination. The studio settled and later announced that Roiland had stepped down.</p>

                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-start-time-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6531984/" data-ref-id="1100-6531984">Xbox Games Showcase</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, a range of Xbox games have begun appearing in Microsoft's Xbox app on PC. While not currently playable, this could be the first look at Microsoft's attempt to unify its PC and Xbox platforms by providing a single library for all of your purchases.</p><p>This approach would align with some peculiar marketing that started appearing when Microsoft announced Gears of War: Reloaded earlier this year. The Xbox Wire announcement noted that the game was due to release on Xbox PC, the first time Microsoft has referred to the PC platform with the Xbox moniker in the name. This followed as a logo in the trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mio-memories-in-orbit/" data-ref-id="5000-632910">MIO: Memories in Orbit</a>, as noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682235/xbox-pc-games-console-library-xbox-360" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, which listed "Xbox PC" as a release platform.</p><p>Right now, a random assortment of Xbox games has started appearing on the Xbox app on PC, from current Xbox Series X|S releases and down to Xbox 360 games. None of them are playable, however, outside of existing games that have released across both platforms already. It's unclear right now if Microsoft is simply trying to centralize your Xbox library across all platforms, or whether some unannounced plans for streaming or emulation of these titles is imminent.</p><p>Microsoft has put effort into improving its app on PC in a race to catch up to Valve's SteamOS. With hardware manufacturers such as Lenovo releasing devices with Valve's version of Linux instead of Windows, Microsoft has made it clear that it is accelerating efforts to streamline gaming on Windows, both on desktop and handhelds, ahead of its collaboration with Asus on an Xbox-branded gaming handheld. These enhancements might include integration with Steam and the Epic Games Store to centralize your entire gaming library in one app, something which is still a bit painful to do via SteamOS.</p><p>Microsoft has numerous titles expected to appear at the Xbox Games Showcase during Summer Game Fest, with hopes for showings of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">State of Decay 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/perfect-dark/" data-ref-id="5000-523746">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fable/" data-ref-id="5000-516160">Fable</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day/" data-ref-id="5000-631971">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everwild/" data-ref-id="5000-504763">Everwild</a>, and, of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight Silksong</a>. You can watch the entire conference as well as the post-show for The Outer Worlds 2 from 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Sunday, June 8.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> proved to be so good, some were slow to give Bloober Team much credit, citing how it had a strong blueprint to build from. It's true that Konami's landmark original is as good a starting point as any, and Bloober Team's earlier works were often met with mixed reviews at best--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloober-team-says-its-done-with-shitty-games-and-silent-hill-2-remake-wasnt-a-fluke/1100-6527269/">the team hasn't shied away from its history</a>. To me, it was nonetheless a tall task to live up to a game that so many hold so dear. But if you count yourself among those who are waiting to see if the Polish team can do it again, and with something entirely of its own creation, Cronos: The New Dawn is starting to look like that game.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in October of last year, Bloober Team told me that it's probably always going to be a studio that makes horror games, and at Summer Game Fest Play Days 2025, the team made it clear that it wanted to find its own gameplay hook with its next project. It looked at Dead Space's combat that drove players to cut off limbs and Alan Wake's way of stripping enemies of their "shields" using light sources, and it knew it didn't want its next game to be a simple point-and-shoot horror game. From that guidance, the "merge system" was born.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the time-traveling horror story is set both before and after an epidemic wipes out much of humanity, the places you explore are often home to a great number of dead bodies. Things fell apart fast, and what's left of people have often been morphed into "orphans," the game's name for its enemy monsters. These grotesque brutes come in different shapes and sizes. Some are armored, others shoot acidic puke at you. Some fling slimy, crimson tentacles toward your face.</p><p dir="ltr">Any one of these can be formidable, but the game's merge system allows enemies to combine into a single being, stack multiple abilities at once, and essentially become boss battles of the player's own negligence. To do this, enemies will simply move toward a body and absorb it, inheriting its abilities. The game's tagline, "Don't let them merge," says it all. Wojciech Piejko, the game's co-director who led me on the hands-off demo, jokingly made a similar point as he purposely allowed the monsters to grow for the sake of the demo. "This is not how you should play this game."</p><p dir="ltr">Piejko told me that in testing the game, the team initially didn't put any restrictions on how many times enemies could merge, giving birth to towering monstrosities that became too big to fit in doorways at times. Now, the game will have some restrictions on that system, like enemies that don't merge, and of course, proper boss battles are often siloed in a controlled environment. But the game's way of allowing enemies to seep into one another and create super-enemies immediately felt like the team had found the hook it was looking for.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508865"></a><figcaption>The alternate-history sci-fi horror story will explore Poland across multiple time periods.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4508865-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players could prevent these mergers from occurring by swiftly killing enemies, or even more proactively, by burning bodies before they reanimated, but your flamethrower, which you discharge like a circular area-of-effect attack with a button press, requires fuel, and this is a horror game, so you can bet that's a tough commodity to come by. From that, tough moment-to-moment choices will be made: Do you use the flamethrower to preemptively dispatch the potential enemies before they've been reborn, or do you save the flamethrower fuel to give yourself some breathing room in a fight for your life?</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond the merge system, I saw a game that was further along in development than I'd anticipated, given that it was only announced less than a year ago. The gunplay looked difficult in the way it should, with headshots hard to pull off on enemies--even when those enemies had multiple heads. The exploration was full of classic survival-horror tropes that I admittedly haven't grown sick of: locked gates needing boltcutters, environmental puzzles that strain reasonable definitions of lived-in spaces, and even a safe room with its own piece in the soundtrack. Notes and audio logs filled in the backstory to a purposely confounding tale inspired by Netflix's Dark. The third-person survival-horror gameplay certainly stands on the shoulders of games and stories that have come before it.</p><p dir="ltr">Although they were developed in tandem for a while and by different teams within the studio, it feels like the lessons Bloober Team learned from Silent Hill 2 are on display. Its time-twisting story has me really interested to see more, and the mix of survival-horror combat and exploration, while familiar, looks really good from this distance. I always err on the side of caution when I've seen only a portion of a much larger game I'll play in full later, but I also feel compelled to state that Cronos: The New Dawn could very well cement a new, more hopeful narrative around this studio.</p>
