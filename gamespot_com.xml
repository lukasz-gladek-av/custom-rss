                <p>Activision originally rolled out its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-ricochet-anti-cheat-driver-for-pc-rolls-out-this-week/1100-6498712/" data-ref-id="1100-6498712">Ricochet anti-cheating measures in 2021</a> to cut down on cheaters in Call of Duty games. While the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-has-led-to-a-significant-drop-in-cheaters-activision-says/1100-6504694/" data-ref-id="1100-6504694">touted Ricochet's successes</a>, the team behind the program is acknowledging that there have been some problems with it during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Season 1.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/12/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-update-december" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty's official site</a>, the Ricochet team said, "We did not hit the mark for the integration of Ricochet Anti-Cheat at the launch of Season 1--particularly for Ranked Play. We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek."</p><p>To that end, the team wrote that account bans are now happening hourly and investigations into cheaters have been ramped up to include more manual reviews of clips from matches in addition to the AI systems already in place to detect cheaters and hackers via the Replay tool. They also stated that cheaters will be removed from leaderboards faster thanks to greater synchronization with the investigations.</p><p>There have been issues with Ricochet where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-anti-cheat-was-falsely-banning-legitimate-players-but-all-accounts-have-been-restored/1100-6527252/" data-ref-id="1100-6527252">legitimate Call of Duty accounts were mistakenly banned</a>, most of which were restored. Black Ops 6's Ranked mode <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-addresses-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-ranked-play-cheaters/1100-6527999/" data-ref-id="1100-6527999">was littered with cheaters upon launch</a>, which Activision blamed on an outage that "was identified as lowering Ricochet's efficiency of the AI systems used for cheat detection."</p><p>The post concluded with a request that Call of Duty players report cheaters as they encounter them. Additionally, the team noted that there are major updates to Ricochet that will be launching during Black Ops 6 Seasons 2 and 3.</p><p>Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-patch-notes-increase-xp-earn-rates-for-bo6-and-fix-a-broken-operator-in-warzone/1100-6528419/" data-ref-id="1100-6528419">dropped a new patch for Black Ops 6</a> to address other issues in the game.

                <p dir="ltr">Epic Games has announced it is taking legal action against a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> player for cheating during a tournament. The publisher recently filed a lawsuit against against Sebastian Araujo, due to multiple instances of alleged cheating that took place during tournament gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The complaint filed by Epic alleges that Araujo has used cheat software in multiple Fortnite tournaments, giving him an "unfair advantage over other, non-cheating players." Specifically, Araujo is accused of using both aimbotting software and cheats that allows him to see other players through walls. Worse, Epic claims that using these cheats in Fortnite tournaments allowed Araujo to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money.</p><p dir="ltr">"Araujo pocketed thousands of dollars that other competitors in the tournaments--who played by the rules--had no real chance to win," the complaint states.</p><p dir="ltr">“We want Fortnite tournaments to be fun and fair for all competitors. People who cheat in tournaments to gain an unfair advantage ruin the experience for everyone. We are making<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-details-chapter-6-season-1" rel="nofollow "> fundamental changes</a> to combat cheating in our tournaments, including taking legal action against players that break our rules,” said Brent Coyle, Competitive Director at Epic Games.</p><p>This isn't the first time Epic Games has taken action against Fornite cheaters. In 2022, the publisher won a lawsuit against an Australian Fortnite cheater, and in a surprisingly wholesome twist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/">Epic donated the settlement money to charity</a>. If Epic wins this lawsuit, Araujo could end up like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/" data-ref-id="1100-6499405">PUBG cheat-maker who was forced to pay $10 million</a> after losing a lawsuit filed by Krafton Inc. and Tencent, or the Destiny 2 cheater who was ordered to pay $500,000 in damages on top of being hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cheater-legally-banned-from-ever-playing-another-bungie-game/1100-6517641/" data-ref-id="1100-6517641">the perma-ban to end all perma-bans</a>.</p>

It includes his faithful steed, Invincible, as well as mount trophies for the Lich King's helmet, the Helm of Domination, and his legendary runeblade, Frostmourne.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1824" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4417938"></a><figcaption>These are just some of the items owners of The War Within and Vessel of Hatred can claim for free.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4417938-diablo4wowfreeinvinciblemountbundle.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To claim the bundle free of charge, players will simply need to own both Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion and WoW: The War Within before January 7. Blizzard states the bundle will be delivered to qualifying players by January 13. Both expansions are currently on sale via <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/sale/holiday-sale-2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battle.net</a> through January 6, with Vessel of Hatred 25% off and The War Within 30% off.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who primarily spend their time in Azeroth, there are some free rewards to be claimed there as well. A number of Diablo-themed cosmetics from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-diablo-4-event-has-players-hunting-down-treasure-goblins/1100-6514568/" data-ref-id="1100-6514568">WoW's Greedy Emissary Diablo 4 launch event</a>, many of which are no longer available, will also be automatically unlocked for those who own both expansions. Those rewards include the Amalgam of Rage mount, Tome of Town Portal toy, the Baa'lial pet, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's just the latest free offering for Diablo 4 players. Blizzard recently gave away <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">free level 50 character boosts to all Diablo 4 players</a>, with Vessel of Hatred owners earning two free boosts. The boosts fully deck out players in a new set of gear and automatically unlock all of the game's stat-boosting Altars of Lilith. Blizzard said the reason behind the boost is to give returning players a fresh entry point following the game's massive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn</a> and Vessel of Hatred updates earlier this year. The two updates dramatically overhauled Diablo 4's loot and endgame systems but in the process made many old items and builds from the game's launch obsolete.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. To celebrate, a number of Blizzard games, including Diablo 4 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-world-of-warcraft-crossover-will-let-players-fight-for-the-horde-or-alliance/1100-6526485/" data-ref-id="1100-6526485">Overwatch 2, offered WoW-themed cosmetics</a>.

                <p>There hasn't been a new game in the Marvel vs. Capcom series since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-review/1900-6416760/" data-ref-id="1900-6416760">Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</a> was released in 2017. Now, players may have a good reason to come back to that title thanks to an upcoming fan-mod, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond, which gives the game an almost literal fresh coat of paint. Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond will be released on December 20 and will only be available on PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PXorZjVETFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite &amp; Beyond was originally started by a modder called WistfulHopes before the project was taken over by Maximillian “Maximilian Dood” Christiansen, who assembled a team to create new art and music, as well as a throwback visual style that more closely resembles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-3-fate-of-two-worlds-review/1900-6298807/" data-ref-id="1900-6298807">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a> than Infinite. The results speak for themselves.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/474516/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-beyond-mod-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Christiansen said he spent $30,000 of his own money to pay the artists and programmers who were enlisted for this project. And since this mod will be released for free, Christiansen won't be making any of that back. Regardless, Christiansen told the outlet that he has no regrets over his investment of time and money.</p><p>"Nobody played [Infinite] because of visuals and roster stuff," said Christiansen. "If the one thing that I can do within my power and budgetary scope is to fix the visuals, something that actually makes it look better, [something that] will get people to even play it, that's the goal--for you to go to Steam and buy Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, [download] our mod, and change the game."</p><p>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite is discounted to $7 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical right now. Earlier this year, Capcom released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-review-new-age-of-heroes/1900-6418278/" data-ref-id="1900-6418278">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection</a> for PlayStation 4, PC, and Switch. That collection will also hit Xbox One sometime in 2025.</p>
