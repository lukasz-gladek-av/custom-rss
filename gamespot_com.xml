                <p dir="ltr">Yes, there are stability improvements, but that's not all with the new system updates rolling out for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review-its-a-switch-too/1100-6532411/">Switch 2</a> and Switch. The patch notes for version 21.0.0 highlight better visual clarity on the home menu for whether a game is owned physically or digitally, GameChat improvements, and a battery description alteration.</p><p dir="ltr">Switch 2 and the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525" rel="nofollow ">original Switch</a> are receiving the new symbols that will "indicate whether the software is a physical or a digital version," according to<a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68473/" rel="nofollow "> Nintendo</a>. The icons are now red like the cartridges for physical Switch 2 games, while they're black for physical Switch titles. However, in general, Switch 2 is seeing more changes with this update. For instance, GameChat should now ensure a game doesn't go to sleep while talking online with a friend. Plus, the system setting language for limiting a charge on the console now says, "Stop Charging Around 80-90%."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-update-out-now-doesnt-do-much/1100-6535105/">Switch 2 system update since version 20.5.0 released in September</a>. That only brought about "stability improvements," something that's expected and joked about constantly in the video game community.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/">Switch 2 has sold 10 million hardware units</a> in just four months of availability. That timeframe doesn't include October, when a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle-buying-guide/1100-6533331/">Switch 2 bundle with Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> launched, so the total number is obviously higher at this point. Meanwhile, Switch has surpassed 154 million units sold, sitting just behind Nintendo DS. It's more than likely at this point that Switch has now become Nintendo's best-selling console ever. Overall, the company has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-has-sold-6-billion-games-including-nearly-1-5-billion-on-switch-alone/1100-6536099/">sold over 870 million systems and 6 billion games</a> over the past 40 years.</p><p>Later this week, there will be <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" rel="nofollow ">a Nintendo Direct</a> for the debut trailer of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Pillsbury has accidentally already given us a good look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whoops-pillsbury-just-gave-us-a-look-at-yoshi-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/1100-6536080/">what Yoshi will look like</a> in the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Below are the patch notes for version 21.0.0:</p><h2>Switch 2</h2><ul><li>Added symbols above software icons displayed on the HOME Menu to indicate whether the software is a physical or a digital version.</li><li>When multiple software downloads are in progress, there is now an option to cancel all.</li><li>If a console bundle includes a

downloadable software.</li><li>You can still receive the software by navigating to Nintendo eShop from the HOME Menu directly.</li></ul></li><li>When finding users to send a friend request to, the Search for Users You’ve Played With option under Add Friendnow includes people you’ve interacted with in your friends’ GameChat rooms.</li><li>Added the ability to download data for a virtual game card even if the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22433" rel="nofollow ">“Use Online License" setting</a> is turned off.  <ul><li>This option is available in the Options of a virtual game card when accessed via Virtual Game Cards from the HOME Menu.</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made for GameChat:  <ul><li>The game will not automatically go to sleep while chatting.</li><li>The option to turn off “Chat Audio Panning” has been added.</li><li>Chat can continue if the console goes from TV mode (docked) to Handheld or Table mode where this scenario changes the internet from a wired connection to a wireless connection.</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made in Accessibility in System Settings:  <ul><li>When Use Text to Speech is turned on, the description of the predictive conversion character on the Japanese keyboard is now read out loud.</li><li>The upper limit of Text-to-Speech Speed was increased from 300% to 400%</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made in Audio in System Settings:  <ul><li>The ability to change the audio mode for a wirelessly connected Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller was added. “Stable” or “Low Latency” can be selected.</li><li>"Low Latency" will reduce audio latency when compared to “Stable” but may be more subject to interference in some wireless environments.</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made in Display in System Settings:  <ul><li>“HDR Output” was renamed to “System Screen’s HDR Output.”</li><li>Improved the screen display when using Adjust Screen Size to make it easier to adjust.</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made in Notifications in System Settings:  <ul><li>The option "Platinum Point Notification” was renamed to "Nintendo Switch Online Notification."</li></ul></li><li>The following updates have been made in System in System Settings:  <ul><li>“Stop Charging Around 90%” was

                <p>Sony has confirmed that Destiny 2 has fallen short of expectations, forcing the company to record an estimated $204 million impairment related to Bungie’s assets. During its Q2 FY2025 earnings call, Sony acknowledged that the popular shooter's player engagement and revenue have been weaker than anticipated since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-acquired-by-sony-for-3-6-billion/1100-6500122/" data-ref-id="1100-6500122">the 2022 acquisition of Bungie for $3.6 billion</a>.</p><p>"Regarding Destiny 2, partially due to changes in the competitive environment, the level of sales and user engagement has not reached the expectation we had at the time of the acquisition of Bungie," CFO Lin Tao explained (translated via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-destiny-2-sales-user-engagement-not-reached-bungie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>).</p><p>Tao noted that Sony has "downwardly revised the business projection for the time being and recorded an impairment loss against a portion of the assets at Bungie." The ¥31.5 billion (approximately $204 million) impairment, combined with an additional ¥18.3 billion (about $118 million) expense tied to development cost corrections. Tao said these adjustments were necessary to reflect the game’s current performance, which has been affected by lower player activity and market competition.</p><p>When asked whether this impairment could be the start of further write-downs, Tao clarified that the goodwill from the Bungie acquisition remains secure.</p><p>"This is an impairment loss of [Bungie's] intangible assets," she said. "As for goodwill, that is supported by the whole game segment, so there will not be any impairment loss for goodwill. For this time, Destiny 2's game performance did not reach the expectations we had when we acquired Bungie." She added that future risks remain for both Destiny 2 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/">Bungie's upcoming shooter Marathon</a> if they fail to meet Sony's goals.</p><p>The financial setback comes as Destiny 2 faces some of its lowest engagement levels in years. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1085660/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam data</a> indicates that player counts are dropping below the lows of 2018's Curse of Osiris, while fans have expressed frustration over missing updates and recent gameplay changes. Bungie has pledged to improve communication and focus on both the "immediate and long-term future" of the game.</p><p>The studio is banking on its next major expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-renegades-expansion-is-star-wars-inspired-and-gives-you-a-lightsaber/1100-6531341/" data-ref-id="1100-6531341">Renegades, launching December 2, 2025</a>, to revive interest. Still, for now, Sony is adopting a more cautious outlook for the once-dominant shooter.</p>
