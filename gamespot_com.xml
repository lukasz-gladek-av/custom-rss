One feature players didn't see coming is the brand-new movement system, which allows players to move precisely one square at a time, allowing strafing and even a cute little hop.</p><p>The new style of movement has been added to aid in construction and decorating. The options are mentioned as part of a tutorial in the Island Designer app, though some players managed to discover the new feature on their own.</p><p>One player posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcmo9h/new_character_movement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> after finding that pressing L now makes your character jump, while others discovered that this was only part of the new movement function, which allows precise movement one square at a time by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcng6f/tapping_and_holding_l/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pressing and holding L</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y4w9GOAXt0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Y4w9GOAXt0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>Compared to New Horizon's usual free movement mode, the new feature essentially snaps players to the game's grid, which should make decorating, pathbuilding, and general terraforming a much smoother process.</span></p><p>Beyond its functionality, the new movements are just <em>fun</em>, with players already planning how they will use the feature's little hops or backwards walks to express themselves in game--why not try <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qcuaou/30_added_a_new_way_to_get_around_town/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">moonwalking</a> around town, for one.</p><p>The new movement scheme is just a small part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/animal-crossing-new-horizons-everything-new-in-update-3-0/2900-7399/" data-ref-id="2900-7399">new 3.0 update</a>, which is live in game now. The latest update adds both quality-of-life updates and some new content, intended to clean up the 2020 title ahead of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-preorder-price-guide/1100-6535855/" data-ref-id="1100-6535855">Switch 2 release</a> on January 15.

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of Re-Logic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503">Terraria</a>, and the developer is still making new content for the game after all of this time. For months, Re-Logic has teased the release of the next update, Terraria 1.4.5. Now, the release date is set for later this month.</p><p>On <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-the-launch-date-revealed-at-last.145833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site</a> for Terraria, Re-Logic announced that Terraria 1.4.5 will launch on January 27. The studio noted that the latest delay was caused because it needed to, "resubmit a few things, which pushed us back a bit further than expected."</p><p>Re-Logic hasn't shared a full list of the new features or improvements coming with the latest update, but it has teased a few during the game's monthly news updates. As an example, villagers will no longer need a house in order to show up in the game. However, they will ask the player to build them a house if there isn't one already.</p><p>One of the most intriguing additions to Terraria 1.4.5 is the RC Car, which was inspired by the Kwad Racer Drone. With the car, players can race around Terraria worlds and climb up backwalls. The racetracks will be customizable, and Re-Logic has invited players to "share them with us when the time comes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Terraria.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg"></figure><p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terraria-is-invades-palworld-later-this-month/1100-6532584/" data-ref-id="1100-6532584">a collaboration with Palworld</a> brought Terraria content into that game. Terraria 1.4.5 will return the favor by adding Palworld content to Terraria. The only confirmed Pal at the moment is Digtoise, who can help players when mining. However, there will be other Pals coming.</p><p>Re-Logic has also noted that nearly 900 bugs will be fixed with Terraria 1.4.5, as well as the "countless little things ... that go into each update." More details will follow later this month when the update arrives on January 27.</p>
