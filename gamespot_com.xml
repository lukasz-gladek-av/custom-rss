                <p>The latest Nintendo Switch 2 firmware update has arrived, but do not expect much in the way of significant changes. Version 20.5.0 launched on September 29 and is focused on stability.</p><p>The one-line patch notes state: "General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience."</p><p>Social media user <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1972886876018123087" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OatmealDome</a>, who is known to pore over the files and discover additional details not mentioned in the patch notes, said there is "no info" on what might be hidden in this new update, if anything. However, OatmealDome said the patch "might have some backwards compatibility fixes."</p><p>The September 29 update for Switch 2 <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68526" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was the second firmware update for the console this month</a>, following version 20.4.0 on September 1. There were no firmware updates in August. The September 29 firmware update for the Switch 2 is the console's sixth overall since the system launched in early June.</p><p>The Switch 2 has sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">more than 6 million units</a>, but that number is going to be updated again soon when Nintendo reports earnings next on November 4.</p><h3><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Ver. 20.5.0 (Released September 29, 2025)</a></h3><ul><li>General system stability improvements to enhance the user's experience.</li></ul>

                <p>Microsoft is gearing up to make some kind of Halo announcement. The developer, Halo Studios, has reaffirmed plans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-rumors-of-halo-on-ps5-and-switch-2-microsoft-confirms-halo-news-is-coming/1100-6532848/" data-ref-id="1100-6532848">first announced in June</a> to reveal "what we've been working on" during the upcoming Halo World Championships event this October.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-sept" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>, Halo Studios said the team will appear on the main state to "talk about it." There will also be a "deep dive" panel lined up that Halo Studios says "you won't want to miss."</p><p>These events both take place on Friday, October 24. That's all Microsoft had to say--the company did not even specify if it plans to talk about new games or if the announcement could be something else.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has already confirmed it's working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">multiple new Halo projects</a>.</p><p>It was at 2024's Halo World Championships that Microsoft revealed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiple-new-halo-games-in-the-works-as-series-moves-to-unreal-and-343-gets-a-new-name/1100-6526938/" data-ref-id="1100-6526938">"A New Dawn" trailer</a> that showed off concepts for new Halo projects in the Unreal Engine, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Project Foundry</a>. This was also when Microsoft announced that 343 Industries was rebranding as Halo Studios.</p><p>2021's Halo Infinite is the latest entry in the main series. Microsoft has made major changes since then, including installing a new executive leadership team and switching game engines for future projects, while acknowledging that Halo Infinite missed the mark in some respects. Xbox boss Matt Booty previously said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">Halo Infinite's launch was like a runner tripping at the finish line.</a></p><p>"Halo Infinite was the last remnant of how we made Halo games in the past.
