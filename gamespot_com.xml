                <p>Almost a week after high-profile Twitch streamer Emiru was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">assaulted during a TwitchCon meet-and-greet</a>, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has posted a statement apologizing to the streamer and acknowledging the multiple failures that allowed the incident to happen.</p><p>While Twitch posted a statement about the assault shortly after it happened, the company's version of events was strongly disputed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/streamer-emiru-disputes-twitchs-account-of-assault-response-at-twitchcon/1100-6535557/" data-ref-id="1100-6535557">Emiru's own statement about the incident</a>. Clancy has also been called out for his comments on the assault during an <a href="https://x.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1979703220705673602" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview</a> with Taylor Lorenz, where he seemed to put the onus back on creators to "control [their] community."</p><p>Clancy has now posted a personal statement on the <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch X account</a>, apologizing directly to Emiru and taking responsibility for the incident. "It shouldnâ€™t have happened and we take that very seriously," Clancy said in the statement. "We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place."</p><p>The statement continues to outline the next steps Twitch will be taking, including a "complete analysis" of the incident involving Emiru, as well as other issues that have been brought up in the wake of TwitchCon 2025. The other issues mentioned in the post include handling of IRL streaming at TwitchCon, as well as issues around accessibility at the event.</p><p>"You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously," the statement concludes. Reactions to the post have been mixed, with some commenters pointing out that Twitch has made similar promises around improving security at TwitchCon in the past. The post was also sent out late on a Friday afternoon, a notoriously <a href="https://politicaldictionary.com/words/friday-news-dump/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">strategic timeslot</a> for companies sharing bad news they want to move on from quickly.</p><p>Emiru has said that she will not be attending TwitchCon again in the future and has strongly urged other creators to reconsider their attendance.</p>

                <p>During the Halo World Championships, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-announced-for-2026-features-new-prequel-missions-and-sprint-but-no-multiplayer/1100-6535695/" data-ref-id="1100-6535695">confirmed the long-rumored remake</a> of the first Halo, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>. It also happens to be the very <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">first Halo game to arrive on PlayStation 5</a>, or any PlayStation platform. Now, Microsoft and Halo Studios have confirmed that all Halo games going forward will be on PlayStation as well as Xbox consoles and PC.</p><p>Following the official announcement of Campaign Evolved, Halo Studios community director Brian Jarrard <a href="https://youtu.be/OrvqXfY_7tU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">appeared on stage</a> at the Halo World Championships and wore a PlayStation T-shirt while sharing the news about the franchise's multi-platform future.</p><p>"It's a huge deal," said Jarrard. "It's a long time coming. We're just super excited to be able to welcome even more players now into the franchise we love, to fall in love with Halo the same way we all did 24 years ago. As a community guy, I know the Halo community is super excited to welcome in their friends as well. It's just going to mean more Halo for everyone. It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p>This shift isn't surprising given Xbox president Sarah Bond recently suggested that the concept of exclusive games "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/" data-ref-id="1100-6535625">is antiquated for most people</a>." The number of Xbox games making the leap to PlayStation has greatly increased over the last two years, including another signature Xbox franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-launch-times-revealed-for-franchises-debut-on-ps5/1100-6534232/" data-ref-id="1100-6534232">Gears of War</a>. There have even been times this year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games dominated the best-selling titles</a> on PlayStation's US sales charts.</p><p>Microsoft didn't announce the rumored <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/">live-service Halo game</a> during the Halo World Championships, but the company has previously said that there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/">multiple new Halo games in the works</a>. The 25th anniversary of the franchise is next year, and Halo: Campaign Evolved will launch in 2026 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>
