                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, has officially reached a milestone of one million copies sold. This figure, announced by Konami via its official <a href="https://x.com/KONAMIUK/status/1963892658960482616" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Twitter account</a>, represents internal sales tracking rather than third-party verified numbers.</p><p>Still, the milestone marks a significant achievement for the project, which has faced intense scrutiny and pressure given the iconic status of the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It's on par with sales figures for <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">other remakes in the series</a>, and could potentially surpass them given time.</p><p>The milestone is notable not just for the sales figures, but also for the weight of its legacy. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first major installment in the series since Hideo Kojima, the franchise's creator and longtime creative force, parted ways with Konami in 2015. The spin-off Metal Gear Survive, which was developed after Kojima had left the company, was not well-received.</p><p>Kojima himself was asked earlier this summer whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he would consider playing the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, and his response was candid and dismissive. With a laugh, the legendary designer replied, "No, I won't." While brief, Kojimaâ€™s comments highlighted the enduring tension between him and Konami, a rift that has continued to shadow every Metal Gear-related development since their split.</p><p>Solid Snake's original American voice actor, David Hayter, said he would have liked to have been involved with Delta just so he could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-would-have-loved-a-redo-with-metal-gear-solid-delta/1100-6534214/" data-ref-id="1100-6534214">redo a lot of the dialogue</a> which carried over from the 2004 game to the remake. "I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," said Hayter. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive got into the publishing game with its IOI Partners program, and MindsEye--from former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy--was the company's first published game. The game struggled mightily out of the gate, with many criticizing its technical performance, among other things. Now, IO's CEO, Hakan Abrak, has reacted to the launch and discussed whether or not the company will continue to publish others' games.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Abrak told IGN</a> that when IO was first chatting with Build a Rocket Boy, the idea was to find a way to "support them," because IO believed in the company's "great ideas." IO was coming in to help Build a Rocket Boy--a brand-new game developer with no releases under its belt before MindsEye--distribute the game.</p><p>For whatever reason, MindsEye had issues, and Abrak addressed this frankly. "Well, that was definitely tough, right?" he said. "It was a tough reception. It wasn't what they hoped for, and also what we didn't hope for at IOI Partners."</p><p>Abrak went on to say that Build a Rocket Boy is now "working hard on turning that around" to help regain trust. He added that he believes the team has "tons of potential."</p><p>MindsEye just got its <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1963898695214039479" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fourth major update this week</a>, and it's a big one, weighing in at as much as 15GB. It fixes bugs and makes performance improvements. A fifth major patch is coming next.</p><p>But will IO continue to publish games via its IOI Partners program? Abrak wasn't ready to confirm anything one way or another. He said IO will publish its own games, including the upcoming James Bond game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007 First Light</a>. But future partnerships? "That remains to be seen," Abrak said.</p><p>007 First Light was the focus of a special PlayStation State of Play broadcast this week, during which IO announced the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-release-date-confirmed-arrives-just-before-gta-6/1100-6534459/" data-ref-id="1100-6534459">release date</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/007-first-light-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-james-bond-game/2900-6978/" data-ref-id="2900-6978">showed off new gameplay</a>, and revealed a $300 collector's edition featuring a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-legacy-edition-preorder-bonuses-release-date-platforms/1100-6534460/" data-ref-id="1100-6534460">replica Golden Gun.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric Barone mentioned in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-getting-stardew-valley-to-a-good-place-with-update-1-6-eric-barone-is-now-fully-focused-on-his-next-game-im-committed-to-not-working-on-stardew-valley-until-im-done-with-haunted-chocolatier/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that he might need to retreat to a cabin in the woods to focus on his next game, Haunted Chocolatier. That sentiment rings true now more than ever, as Barone juggles multiple projects--including the newly announced Stardew Valley 1.7 update and a surprise voice cameo in Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/stardew-valleys-eric-barone-is-in-the-hollow-knight-silksong-credits-for-voicing-a-mystery-character/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> caught Barone's name appearing in the credits of Silksong, listed alongside members of Team Cherry and even the family of lead designer William Pellen. Given the shared success of Stardew Valley and Hollow Knight, which launched within a year of each other and became landmark indie titles, it's no surprise their creators have formed connections within the indie development scene.</p><p>His role in Silksong involved providing non-verbal character sounds--for those familiar, Nintendo-style chirps and mutterings--for one of the game's new NPCs. While Barone hasn't revealed which character he voiced, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/771772/hollow-knight-silksong-stardew-valley-eric-barone-concernedape" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> confirmed it was indeed him. Fans are now left to guess which bug-like denizen of the kingdom of Parloom bears his signature tones.</p><p>Despite this side contribution, Barone remains fully focused on Haunted Chocolatier. Even though the 1.7 update for Stardew Valley may slow development slightly, Barone insists the impact will be minimal. As for his voice work in Silksong, it was a small and likely long-completed task and more a fun detour than a distraction.</p>

The new poll once again offers three options that players can pick between--hireable drivers, shrooms, and fishing.</p><p>One of the poll options, shrooms, was originally offered in the first community poll, only to be defeated by the rival cartel. If shrooms is victorious this time, it will add a brand-new psychadelic drug type for players to offer to their customer base.</p><p>Hirable drivers, the most functional of the new options, offers players the ability to hire drivers who can transport items between your various properties, businesses, and dealers. This new feature will also come with a quality of life update to the existing delivery system.</p><p>The last new option is a video game classic--a fishing minigame. If players vote to add fishing to Schedule 1, they'll be able to catch fish, with the potential to reel in other special items too. Fishing will act as an extra revenue stream for players who get into it, with the fish you catch able to be sold at Randy's Bait &amp; Tackle store for profit. The update will also add some new ingredients and effects to play with.</p><p>Voting is available to everyone who owns the game, and can be accessed in-game from the main menu. Voting is only open until this coming weekend, and the results will be visible in game after voting closes.</p><p>The last time Schedule 1 creator Tyler held a community vote, the most popular feature was the rival cartel with 64% of the vote. The feature is now live in the game as of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-update-adds-rival-cartel-wars/1100-6534328/" data-ref-id="1100-6534328">latest major update</a>, offering new mid-late game content for dedicated Schedule 1 players.</p><p>Schedule 1 is a popular Steam title themed around building a drug-selling empire. The game is still in early access for now, and is being developed by a solo developer--though Tyler has said he may hire more developers to work on Schedule 1 team soon.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
