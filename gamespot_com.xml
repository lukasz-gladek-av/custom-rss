                <p>One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">big reveals</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a> today was the debut game from Bruce Straley's Wildflower Interactive, called Coven of the Chicken Foot. A single-player adventure about an elderly witch named Gertie and a peculiar creature, the game sees the two build a bond as they learn to work together to fulfill an oath. The big draw is the creature's technology, which will react dynamically to your actions, observing how you play and evolving its abilities to assist you.</p><p>Set in a stylized fantasy world where all the dungeons have been plundered, monsters have been slain, and heroes have moved on, Coven of the Chicken Foot will see players venture into deadly dungeons and dangerous forests. Gertie doesn't swing a sword to stay out of danger, but the creature can adapt to assist her. Wildflower Interactive says that Coven of the Chicken Foot will be a wordless game, as the story will be pieced together by paying attention to your environment and the small choices you make along the way.</p><p>Wildflower Interactive was formed in 2021 by Bruce Straley. The veteran game director and artist cut his teeth working on titles like X-Men and Gex: Enter the Gecko in the '90s, and after a stint at Crystal Dynamics, he joined Naughty Dog in 1999. Straley worked on several of the studio's big games during the 2000s, and he served as game director on blockbusters like Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, The Last of Us, and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End.</p><p>Straley announced his departure from Naughty Dog in 2017, and he'd go on to work as a story consultant on 2018's Chained: A Victorian Nightmare. Several years later, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-uncharted-co-director-starts-new-studio-aims-to-make-small-ish-games/1100-6505693/">Wildflower Interactive was formed</a>, with Straley revealing that the studio aims to create "small-ish" titles that are "creatively charged" and "uniquely stylized."</p><p>"Wildflower Interactive is built on the notion of pushing myself creatively and working with like-minded creative people, driven by a strong desire to continue the conversation about what kind of experiences video games can deliver," Straley said in a press release.</p><p>"We're doing that with Coven of the Chicken Foot. It nods at the fun and simplicity of old-school games, while also evolving the pairing of storytelling and interactivity in a new, challenging way. I'm very proud of what we've built at Wildflower and can't wait for people to explore the world we’re creating and get to know our lovable duo."</p><p>A release date hasn't been set yet, but Coven of the Chicken Foot is coming to PC via Steam.</p>

                <p>During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">The Game Awards</a>' Opening Act, the 30-minute pre-show before the show-show begins, developer Day 4 Night unveiled a quirky little trailer for a super-nostalgic 3D platformer with a cute little badger trying to save his home. Move over, Mario and Donkey Kong, because there's a new jumpman in town ... or the woods--wherever badgers live.</p><p>Bradley the Badger is an upcoming action-adventure platform that, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to its Steam Store page</a>, is a "love letter to games." More specifically, the game is this hodgepodge of game-development ideas and faux pas. There are unfinished game worlds you'll have to put back together, "under review" cathedrals you'll have to explore, and copious enemies to find as you do it all.</p><p>As the trailer continues, they are fascinating worlds with funny names: Badgerborne, Cyberbadger, The Last Badger, and the like, all based on tropey game concepts. It's a little reminiscent of Hazelight Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whIOq6WVNSY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/whIOq6WVNSY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The best part? Bradley the Badger is voiced by Evan Peters, the American actor who portrays Peter "Quicksilver" Maximoff in various Marvel films, from Deadpool 2 to X-Men: Apocalypse to Dark Phoenix.</p><p>Bradley the Badger will be available on Steam, though no other platforms and no release date was confirmed at the time of its announcement. That said, you can wishlist the game on Steam now. </p><p>The Game Awards are officially underway, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">the world premieres are rolling in</a>. Capcom's Pragmata is coming to Nintendo Switch in April 2026, Jämmerdal Games revealed a first-person souls-like called Decrepit, and GPTRACK50 has a new third-person action-zombie game with possibly the best title ever: Stupid Never Dies.</p>
