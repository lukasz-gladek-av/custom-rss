                <p>Grand Theft Auto V actor Ned Luke, who played Michael in the incredibly popular game, has spoken out about his thoughts on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>. He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fall Damage</a> (<a href="https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1886459125304799531" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Dexerto</a>) that he's confident the game will be "fantastic," going on to say no one ever knows what to expect from Rockstar Games, and that's part of the reason why he's so eager to see what the studio is cooking up.</p><p>"You never know what Rockstar is going to do," he said. "What I tell people is, be patient. It's going to be worth the wait. From what I've seen, it's going to be amazing. They're going to blow our [GTA V] numbers away."</p><p>By "numbers," Luke was referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gtav-generates-800-million-in-24-hours/1100-6414611/" data-ref-id="1100-6414611">$800 million that GTA V earned in its first 24 hours back in 2013.</a> Luke said he expects GTA VI to make $1.3 billion in its first day.</p><p>Before this, DFC Intelligence said it was expecting GTA VI to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copes and earn $3.2 billion in its first year</a>, including $1 billion from preorder revenue alone.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUKXTE2S5mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vUKXTE2S5mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also in the interview, Luke pointed out how his character, Michael, has never been brought back to GTA Online. GTA V's other two main characters, Trevor (Steven Ogg) and Franklin (Shawn Fonteno), did come to GTA Online. A piece of GTA Online DLC revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-onlines-new-dlc-confirms-michael-is-still-alive-after-gta-5-story/1100-6499135/" data-ref-id="1100-6499135">Michael is still alive after the events of GTA V</a>, and this has led many to believe Rockstar might eventually release new GTA Online DLC that focuses on or at least includes Michael.</p><p>If Luke knows the answer, he's not revealing any secrets.</p><p>"If you look at GTA Online, for example, Michael hasn't been back on GTA Online. Maybe he's coming in a final DLC? Maybe he's not. Maybe [Michael, Franklin, and Trevor will be] in GTA 6, like [its online mode]. Maybe. Maybe not. You know Rockstar is not going to tell you anything. And if we say anything, you know they will not be very happy," Luke said.</p><p>Ogg, who played Trevor in GTA V, said previously that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-trevor-actor-wants-a-very-definitive-exit-in-gta-6/1100-6529064/" data-ref-id="1100-6529064">he wants his character to show up in GTA VI and then immediately get killed.</a></p><p>In other news, there is said to be "hope" by some in the video game industry that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA VI will cost as much as $100</a>, with other publishers raising prices as well to help the video game industry rebound. While some might want that, not everyone does, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">one prominent researcher believes the game will be $70.</a></p><p>GTA VI's first trailer was released in December 2023, and since then, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">Rockstar has not said a word about the game</a>, while management at parent company Take-Two has only discussed the game at a very high level. That's expected to happen again this week, when Take-Two reports earnings on February 6.</p><p>GTA VI is set for release in Fall 2025, but some believe the game will be delayed to 2026. After all, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">every Rockstar Games release in the past 10 years has been delayed</a>, so it would be a break from tradition if the game is <em>not </em>delayed.</p>

                <p>With tariffs by the US set to take effect on Tuesday, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA) expressed concern about how they may affect the video game industry. In a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/esa-statement-on-proposed-tariffs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement on its website</a>, the ESA warned that import taxes on gaming devices would "negatively impact hundreds of millions of Americans."</p><p>The ESA, the trade association representing most of the major publishers in gaming, said that tariffs would "harm the [game] industryâ€™s significant contributions to the US economy." The ESA ended the statement by saying it was looking forward to "working with the [Trump] Administration and Congress to find ways to sustain the economic growth" supported by the game industry. According to the ESA, total video game sales in the US <a href="https://www.theesa.com/u-s-consumer-spending-on-video-games-totaled-58-7-billion-in-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reached $58.7 billion in 2024</a>.</p><p>The US government is set to enact import taxes on Canada and China at 12 AM ET on February 4. Canada faces a 25% tariff on products imported to the US, while China, where technology products, including video game consoles, are manufactured, is looking at a 10% tariff. The Trump administration initially targeted Mexico, a hotspot for video game disc production, with a 25% import tax, but Trump agreed on Tuesday to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-sheinbaum-trudeau-017efa8c3343b8d2a9444f7e65356ae9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">halt planned tariffs on Mexico</a> for a month. All three countries have announced their own countermeasures, including <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-retaliation-trudeau-sheinbaum-70e067b092a3af72c2eb7ca37d532c91" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">retaliatory tariffs against the US</a>.</p><p>Trump also expressed intentions to enact tariffs on computer chips, a plan he still appeared keen on pursuing even after <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/despite-meeting-with-nvidia-ceo-trump-sticks-with-plan-to-tariff-foreign" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">meeting with Nvidia CEO</a> Jensen Huang on Friday. On Monday morning, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-falls-as-trumps-tariffs-send-shockwaves-across-the-market-150548726.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stocks for Nvidia</a>, which designs and supplies graphics cards, fell as potential tariffs loomed over tech companies.</p><p>The tangible <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">effect of tariffs on video game products</a> is currently unknown, but Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">predicted that prices for games</a>--both in physical and digital formats--could rise as a result.</p>

Of course, that sort of change--with Criterion supporting the single-player experience for the next Battlefield--brings up questions about whether the developer might only be focused on the shooter series going forward.</p>
