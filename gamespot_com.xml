                <p>EA has given us our first look at gameplay from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next entry in the long-running Battlefield series</a>.</p><p>This gameplay footage came at the end of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Introducing Battlefield Labs</a> video released by EA on Monday morning. That video outlines how DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive are all working together on the next Battlefield and plan on heavily emphasizing player testing throughout the rest of the competitive first-person shooter's development. At the end, we see a sizzle reel of pre-alpha gameplay.</p><p>There's a lot that can be learned from the seven clips shown. We see a large squad of soldiers fighting in various parts of the city. The gameplay looks fairly similar to the more grounded games in the series, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-4/" data-ref-id="5000-147664">Battlefield 4</a>. We see buildings constantly collapsing around players during this shootout, and the final gameplay clip of the video shows a player shooting a building with an explosive weapon and watching it collapse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fGteYuaNxA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_fGteYuaNxA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Destruction has always been a heavily promoted aspect of the Battlefield series, and this latest entry will continue to emphasize that. Vehicles will also play a large part in that destruction, as we see a tank fighting alongside soldiers in the gameplay footage. It's only about 10 seconds of footage, but a lot can already be discerned from it.</p><p>The next Battlefield title does not have a name or release date at this time, as it's still in active development at the pre-alpha stage. You can sign up for <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to play the game early and help EA test the game.</p>

                <p>Electronic Arts and DICE have announced Battlefield Labs, a new community test program for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">next Battlefield game</a> that aims to help make the new game the best it can be. EA is rolling out this program in the wake of the poor reception to Battlefield 2042, which launched in a rough state back in 2021.</p><p>EA also announced Battlefield Studios, which is the new banner under which four studios will make "the future of Battlefield." These development teams include DICE, Ripple Effect, Criterion, and Motive. <strong>DICE</strong> is working on multiplayer, <strong>Motive</strong> is developing single-player content (and multiplayer maps), <strong>Ripple Effect</strong> is making an unannounced new Battlefield experience, and <strong>Criterion</strong> is a partner studio supporting single-player, EA said in the video below. The first gameplay footage for the new Battlefield game was also released in the video and can be see--albeit briefly and in pre-alpha form--at the end of the video.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Introducing Battlefield Labs | Battlefield Studios</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>How to sign up for Battlefield Labs</strong></h2><p>Anyone can <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a>, but DICE said only a select number of players will be admitted, and the test itself is only open to people in North America and Europe to begin with. More territories will be added later as the test environment expands. Only a "few thousand" people will get in to the test, EA said, and it will comprise both Battlefield veterans and newcomers alike. Eventually, EA will ramp up the test to include "tens of thousands" of people.</p><p>Those who are chosen for the testing program will get to play an early version of the next Battlefield game and share feedback with DICE to help make the game the best Battlefield possible. The testing will take place across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is our most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history, launching as we enter a critical phase in development," DICE said. "We want to build Battlefield with our community. So it is a space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of Battlefield; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs is launching as we enter a critical phase in development with what's next for Battlefield where we are looking to cross-collaborate with the community like never before. Now is the time to test big areas of the experiences our teams have been building for our upcoming launch."</p><p>The first Battlefield Labs test will begin "in the coming weeks," DICE said. An EA Account is required. EA said there will not be a "rigid cadence" for the testing sessions. "The plan is to run sessions that are at appropriate times for different players in different regions, and build (to allow for repeated testing) every few weeks. Test sessions scheduled will be pre-defined and communicated directly to Battlefield Labs participants ahead of them taking place," EA said.</p><p>As for the available content, EA said players admitted to the test will get to try an "early test of concepts and mechanics, and that players should expect "rough edges, bugs, and crashes."</p><p>"Battlefield Labs content will be tested at a time in our development when it is critical for us to cross-collaborate with our community, with their feedback being crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic Battlefield experience," EA said. "Each Battlefield Labs testing session will have specific feedback goals, whether very specific to core combat loops, or map layout for example, or more general goals around the content being tested and how fun it is for players."</p><p>EA said it will test "almost everything" via the Battlefield Labs program.</p><p>"Even in pre-alpha, we are proud of where the game is at. We tirelessly playtest, but your feedback will supercharge our development as we strive to hit that perfect note between form, function, and feel," EA said. "This is an unprecedented moment for Battlefield. We will start by testing the pillars of play, like core combat and destruction. Then transition to balance and feedback for our weapons, vehicles and gadgets, ultimately leading to where all these pieces come together in our maps, modes, and squad play."</p><p>The Conquest and Breakthrough modes will be in the Battlefield Labs tests as well, EA assured fans, referring to the franchise's most iconic modes. "BF Labs will also be a place to explore new ideas and fine-tune and improve Battlefield pillars like our class system (Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon) to create deeper more strategic play," EA said.</p><p>Players can submit feedback directly to the developers via a private Discord channel. EA said its teams will collect feedback and come up with plans that inform "what we need to prioritize, what we need to improve, and what we need to change to make it an authentic Battlefield experience when we release it publicly."</p><p>EA said it will publish public recaps of what it's learned from the testing phases, in addition to the steps being taken to address fan feedback. What that means is even if you don't get chosen to participate, you'll still be able to learn about what's changing and why.</p><p>EA also noted that everyone invited to the test will have to sign an NDA that prohibits them from talking about or showing off any footage of the early version of the next Battlefield.</p><p>What's more, EA published the system requirements on PC for the Battlefield Labs test, which can be seen below.</p><ul><li>PC Minimum Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT 6GB</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li><li>PC Recommended Specs:  <ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-10700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia RTX 3060Ti / AMD Radeon RX 6700-XT</li><li>Memory: 16GB</li><li>Storage: Minimum 30GB</li></ul></li></ul><p>The test environment for the new Battlefield game is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/" data-ref-id="1100-6526539">EA already confirmed a large-scale testing period for the game back in 2024.</a></p><h2><strong>Battlefield Studios</strong></h2><p>As for the shift to the Battlefield Studios umbrella, EA said it needed multiple teams to realize its ambition for the future of Battlefield.</p><p>"To make our vision for the future of Battlefield a reality, we had to think bigger than just one studio. We rallied 20+ years of Battlefield experience, combined them with the best emerging talent in the industry, and united them under a single banner: Battlefield Studios," EA said. "This represents the largest team in franchise history, across a world-class group of development studios, focused on delivering on our ambitious vision for the future full of fun, authentic Battlefield experiences for our community built on our unique DNA."</p><p>The next Battlefield, which doesn't have an official title yet, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">returns to modern times</a> after Battlefield 2042 took the fight to the future. Battlefield boss Vince Zampella said previously that Battlefield 2042 didn't resonate with fans in part because some of the game's ideas were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-strayed-a-little-too-far-from-what-makes-the-series-fun-ea-exec-says/1100-6507599/undefined/" data-ref-id="1100-6507599">too ambitious</a>, like its 128-player matches.</p><p>"I think they just strayed a little too far from what Battlefield is. They tried to do a couple things that were maybe ambitious: grow the player count etc. I don't think they spent enough time iterating on what makes that fun," Zampella said. "It's not inherently a bad idea. The way they were set up and the way they executed just didn't allow them to find the best thing possible."</p><p>DICE's new GM, Rebecka Coutaz, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">the work-from-home setup was challenging as well for Battlefield 2042.</a></p><p>"It is different to work from home, even though that is the way we're working now, it took time to adapt," Coutaz said. "And it took time to know how to work well together. Everybody was disappointed--our community, our players, and our team as well. It's a team that has invested years of their lives into this game. And for that game not to live up to any expectations from the team or from the players, that was tough. We are moving forward and we've done a lot of things since then."</p><p>Zampella was elevated to the overall boss of Battlefield after Battlefield 2042's launch. He has said that under his watch, the Battlefield series is being developed under a "whole new structure."</p><p>"We're putting multiple studios together. We're bringing the best talent together and giving them the time to do something amazing," Zampella said.</p><p>Though Battlefield 2042 might not have landed with everyone, the game finished 2021 as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-vanguard-and-black-ops-cold-war-were-no-1-and-2-best-selling-games-of-2021-in-the-us/1100-6499720/" data-ref-id="1100-6499720">fifth-best-selling game of the year in the US</a>.</p>

                <p>Soon after EA's announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> failed to meet the company's expectations, BioWare staffers revealed that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">were laid off</a>, in addition to those moved to other parts of the company. A recent report states that with the collective firings, it leaves BioWare with fewer than 100 staff members remaining. </p><p>The reason given by BioWare GM Gary McKay was taking the time to "reimagine" what the studio will look like going forward as a "more agile, focused studio that produces unforgettable RPGs." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-31/electronic-arts-slashes-bioware-after-dragon-age-sales-miss?embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=HrWXCALa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> is reporting that the studio now has fewer than 100 employees, down from more than 200 during the development of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. At its peak, BioWare consisted of three studios with a conservative estimate of 400 employees.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="272506856" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

the next Mass Effect after Veilguard launched, but the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">missed its "engagement" target by 50%</a>. EA did not share specific goal numbers for EA Sports FC 25, simply explaining that it underperformed following two years of growth for the franchise.</p><p>Veilguard's disappointment caps off a decade of BioWare underperformance. Live-service game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/anthem-review-two-halves/1900-6417093/" data-ref-id="1900-6417093">Anthem</a> did not receive good reviews and was eventually shut down, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-andromeda-review/1900-6416638/" data-ref-id="1900-6416638">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a> did match the quality--or sales--of the original trilogy. Even the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-legendary-edition-review/1900-6417679/" data-ref-id="1900-6417679">remastered trilogy</a> faired much better by comparison.</p><p>Both Dragon Age: The Veilguard and EA Sports FC 25 received generally favorable reviews from critics, sitting at aggregated <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scores of 82</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ea-sports-fc-25/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">76 on Metacritic</a>, respectively.</p>
