This is the only "physical" option available, but bear in mind this is simply a steelbook case with a digital code for the PC and Xbox versions of the game. There is no disc included in this version--meaning you can't actually buy Avowed on disc anywhere. Nevertheless, you do get a few extras if you purchase this version, including early access to the full game if you preorder.

It includes the full game and all digital content from the physical edition but ditches the steelbook case, map, and letter. You also get the 5-day early access. If you just want to grab the game without the extra goodies or early access, a <a href="https://howl.link/55qopx1r2fdq8?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17317009430309?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$70 standard digital edition</a> is available to preorder on Xbox and PC via Best Buy, the Microsoft Store, and Steam. Technically, there's an even cheaper way to buy the game on PC: by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-buy-avowed-with-wow-gold-heres-how/1100-6527800/" data-ref-id="1100-6527800">using World of Warcraft in-game gold</a>, which is one of the payment option on Blizzard's Battle.net launcher.</p><p dir="ltr">As a Microsoft exclusive, Avowed will be added to Game Pass Ultimate for Xbox Series X|S and PC. You won't own the game, but it is the cheapest way to play Avowed at launch. And if you want the Premium Edition content, you can pick up an upgrade kit for $25 to access those perks, including five days early access. Keep in mind that playing new Game Pass games at launch is only available for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Game Pass Ultimate costs $20/month, or you can buy prepaid <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1-Month codes for $17</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">3-Month codes for $50 at Amazon</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes access to cloud streaming for hundreds of Game Pass titles, including Avowed. If you're interested in playing Avowed via the cloud or simply want a new Xbox controller, you should check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGHMK89?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's limited-time bundle deal</a> that includes an Xbox Wireless Controller, Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K, and one-month Game Pass Ultimate prepaid card for $75 (was $137). Depending on your connection, cloud streaming quality can be spotty and won't be as stable or smooth as playing the game on console or Windows, but this is the simplest and most affordable way to play the game if you don't already have an Xbox Series X|S or gaming PC.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGGG4NNK?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$80 bundle with the Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a>, which offers a more reliable connection and speedier performance. 4K Fire Sticks now support the Game Pass app, so one of these bundles is all you need to play Avowed.</p><hr><hr><p dir="ltr">While Avowed has obvious similarities to other first-person RPGs like The Elder Scrolls series --such as branching dialog systems, first-person melee combat, and fantastical worlds to explore--a closer approximation would be Obsidian's sci-fi RPG The Outer Worlds, as both games take place in smaller interconnected zones rather than expansive, contiguous open worlds.

Unlike Avowed, these are top-down, party-based RPGs akin to classic computer games like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale. Obsidian says won't need to have played the Pillars of Eternity games to understand the story of Avowed, but they're still worth checking out for fans of classic computer RPGs and anyone curious to know more about the setting.

                <p>Ubisoft has responded to a big Assassin's Creed leak that revealed the first information about Animus Hub, which is the new name for the codename Infinity project. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1gs3ahg/a_message_from_the_team_on_the_animus_hub/?rdt=40110" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Reddit</a>, Ubisoft said "inaccurate rumors" were spreading online, so it decided to clear a few things up.</p><p>First off, all rewards in the Animus Hub are "entirely free," Ubisoft said. Additionally, there will be no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass in the Animus Hub. The company went on to say that it will add "content and missions" to the Animus Hub regularly at no extra cost.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1278129363" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Ubisoft's Reddit post was the first time the company officially revealed the real name for codename Infinity, though a developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-gets-a-new-name/1100-6524281/" data-ref-id="1100-6524281">used its name back in June in a media interview.</a></p><p>The leak revealed that players will be able to unlock a variety of cosmetics for their characters and weapons. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">As we reported previously</a>, some of the cosmetics include futuristic weapon skins and armor alongside mythological mounts and resources that players can use inside the game, and one of the other leaked images shows co-protagonist Yasuke standing inside the Animus Hub.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to February 14, 2025</a> so that its developers would have more time to polish the game.

                <p>Donkey Kong 64 has a special place in a generation of gamers' hearts and scooped up several awards the year of its release--for a quick nostalgia trip, you can read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-64-review/1900-2543651/" data-ref-id="1900-2543651">review from 1999</a>. The game brought Donkey Kong and his friends into the first 3D space after the Donkey Kong Country series had wrapped on the previous generation of consoles. While the gameplay is still iconic, even more so was the opening theme "The DK Rap", which introduced players to the characters.</p><p>In celebration of the game's 25th anniversary, rapper Substantial, along with original composer Grant Kirkhope, teamed together for a remix album called <a href="https://www.materiacollective.com/music/rare-treats-donkey-kong-64-revisited" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rare Treats: Donkey Kong 64 Revisited</a>. The song--one of 14 tracks on the album--features new beats, and some new lyrics, but still has that funky DK vibe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1zpE20K4Wk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V1zpE20K4Wk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This isn't just a nostalgia trip--it's a full-blown, banana-fueled celebration, with revisited recordings and versions re-arranged by composer Grant Kirkhope. Track titles have also been updated to match their intended destiny," the official song description reads. "Remade by the legend himself, Grant Kirkhope: The original composer and living legend who brought you the unforgettable tracks of Banjo-Kazooie and GoldenEye 007 has returned to remaster the DK64 soundtrack."</p><p>Kevin Bayliss, the designer of the original Donkey Kong 64 characters, even provided the cover album and inserts as well.</p><p>DK Rap was featured in last year's megahit The Super Mario Bros. Movie, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-composer-of-dk-rap-goes-uncredited-in-super-mario-bros-movie/1100-6512983/" data-ref-id="1100-6512983">Kirkhope was not credited for the film</a>, the only instance of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0456622/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">that ever happening</a>. The song has subsequently appeared in multiple games since then--most notably as stage music in multiple Super Smash Bros. games--and Kirkhope was credited as the original composer in every other use.</p>
