                <p>Three-time Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has revealed some of his favorite video games, including BioShock, Death Stranding, Red Dead Redemption, and God of War, among others.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52OOT_-5tqE&amp;t=2583s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>, del Toro said Sony's God of War series had some of the "best cinematic experiences" he's ever witnessed.</p><p>"When [Kratos] fights Odin [in God of War Ragnarok] and Odin keeps coming back and he looks like a Peaky Blinders brawler. He beats the crap out of Kratos. What a great video game. And the way they use the budget of data on the console to create atmospheric dispersion and light. That is lit like a film," he said.</p><p>The filmmaker went on to say BioShock is the "most immersive" game he's played, while he singled out Death Stranding (a game he is featured in) as another one of his faves. The game with the best universe is Metal Gear Solid, he added.</p><p>Some of his other favorite games include Left 4 Dead and "big sandbox games" like Red Dead Redemption. He also called out Shadow of the Colossus and labeled it a "masterpiece" that is "poetic and tragic."</p><p>Del Toro himself was for a period of time working on a game called Insane that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insane-cancelled/1100-6390635/" data-ref-id="1100-6390635">making alongside Saints Row studio Volition until THQ canceled the project.</a> He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toros-insane-to-be-a-trilogy/1100-6285306/" data-ref-id="1100-6285306">aimed for it to become a trilogy</a>, and after it was canceled, the director said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toro-not-giving-up-on-insane/1100-6398161/" data-ref-id="1100-6398161">not giving up on it</a> and looking to find another way to bring it to market. That never happened, however.</p><p>At The Game Awards in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-seemingly-teased-by-guillermo-del-toro-at-the-game-awards/1100-6498859/" data-ref-id="1100-6498859">del Toro seemingly hinted at a Silent Hill project</a>, but he later clarified that he was only trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-game-awards-tease-was-meant-to-tickle-the-ribs-of-konami-del-toro-says/1100-6499214/" data-ref-id="1100-6499214">"tickle the ribs of Konami"</a> after the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/">shut down his Silent Hills project.</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-fear-changed-the-legacy-of-p-t/1100-6525725/" data-ref-id="1100-6525725">AKA P.T.</a></p><p>Following the cancellations of Insane and Silent Hills, del Toro said he gave up on trying to make a video game. "I have proven to be the albatross of video games," he said.</p><p>"I have decided, in order not to destroy anyone else's life, I will never again get involved in video games. Otherwise, I'll join someone and his house will explode, or something," the filmmaker explained.</p><p>Del Toro is known for making scary and unsettling films, including Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, and Nightmare Alley. He won two Oscars for The Shape of Water and one of Pinocchio. His newest movie, Frankenstein: The Anatomy Lesson, stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, and Mia Goth, and is streaming now on Netflix and playing in select theaters.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The patch notes for the December 10 update detail various bug fixes and improvements across all modes, but some of the changes are a disappointment for Zombies players.</p><p dir="ltr">A few bugs are squashed for Season 1's new Astra Malorum Zombies map. The patch notes address an issue where Oscar could become stuck in the starting area, and it also fixes the map's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-wonder-weapon-how-to-get-the-lgm-1-in-astra-malorum/1100-6536739/">LGM-1 Wonder Weapon</a>, which could sometimes fire with unintended behavior when paired with certain GobbleGums and the Frenzied Fire augment. Unfortunately, this also affects a strategy players were using to help make the Wonder Weapon more powerful during the tough boss fight for Astra Malorum.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously awarded players the completion rewards for the Astra Malorum boss fight even when the encounter was actually failed.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer, the developer patches locations where players could leave the intended playspace on the following maps: Standoff, Fate, Scar, Paranoia, and Toshin.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously prevented One in the Chamber from being selected as a game mode in private matches, and it addresses a bug that prevented the loading-screen stats from being displayed in the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's Endgame campaign mode gets small fixes as well. The update addresses a bug that previously prevented exotic-rarity weapons from making any progress toward their camos or base weapon levels. It also fixes an issue that blocked a player's dedicated melee weapon from functioning properly with the Mega Punch exotic skill.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the update buffs the Heartbeat Sensor equipment. This increases the sensor's detection range from 15 to 60 meters, and it improves the device's ping sweep smoothing for more consistent and cleaner scans when players pull up the monitor. The developer says this change was made to reinforce the device's role as an information tool.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Heartbeat Sensor is intended to serve as a counter to Ghost, but its previous detection range was not impactful enough to consistently influence engagements," the developer says.</p><p dir="ltr">Bug fixes for Warzone include one that impacted being able to see loading-screen stats and another issue with using permanent unlock tokens on perks while in the loadout menu.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>This update comes a day after the publisher announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/">major strategic shift for the Call of Duty series</a>.
