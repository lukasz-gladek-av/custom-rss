Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as CEO Ted Gill were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>, and they subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">filed a lawsuit against Krafton</a> that contends the latter is attempting to avoid paying them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Now, Krafton has changed its legal argument about why the leadership team was dismissed.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/the-subnautica-2-lawsuit-is-getting-even-messier-with-krafton-doing-a-massive-u-turn-confusing-both-the-ousted-founders-lawyer-and-the-judge-this-is-a-little-bit-bewildering/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Krafton asserted that the founders intended to release Subnautica 2 in early access this year before the game was ready in order to secure their performance bonus. The founders' lawyers at Fortis Advisors asked for proof of this assertion during the trial's discovery phase, and Krafton didn't provide any. Krafton subsequently withdrew that part of its legal filing and no longer claims it as a reason for their dismissal. Fortis said this marks a "seismic shift in the case" and characterized it as "a little bit bewildering."</p><p>Krafton still maintains that the founders shirked their responsibilities to oversee Subnautica 2 to completion and accuses them of downloading files and keeping devices that had confidential info on them. Although that detail only came to light after the leadership team was removed, Krafton argues that it retroactively justifies their termination.</p><p>Fortis contends that Krafton hasn't been properly cooperating during discovery and is ignoring requests to confer or share information pertinent to the case. The most recent update is that both sides agreed to confer.</p><p>This case may play out in court for years, but the battle in the court of public opinion has already begun. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a> over reports that the $250 million bonus was being withheld, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting its financial benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of that bonus would have gone to the former leadership team prior to their forced exits from the company.</p><p>Subnautica 2 is expected to hit early access in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>If you're like me, one of the first things you do when booting up a game is checking out the options in the Settings menu. From audio to subtitles, brightness to performance, you're fine-tuning the particulars to ensure the game is playing just right for you. Maybe during this, you're also changing your controller settings from "normal" to "inverted," and if you've ever wondered why you do that, well, science may have an answer for you.</p><p>In a new scientific paper reported on by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Guardian</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/scientists-have-worked-out-why-some-people-invert-video-game-controls-and-its-not-just-because-they-are-correct" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Dr. Jennifer Corbett and Dr. Jaap Munneke at Brunel University London have sought to study the neuroscience behind a player's choice of "normal" or "inverted" controls. Titled "Why axis inversion? Optimising interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments," the duo discovered that there are a variety of factors that go into your decision of opting for a particular controller setting in games, and it seems to primarily revolve around how your brain perceives objects in 3D spaces.</p>

<p>Initiated during lockdown and published this month, Corbett and Munneke concluded in the study that "personal experiences, favourite games, different genres, age, consoles, which way you scroll with a mouse … all of these things could potentially be involved" in why you choose to invert your controls in-game or not.</p><p>"Many people told us that playing a flight simulator, using a certain type of console, or the first game they played were the reasons they preferred to invert or not," Corbett said. "Many also said they switched preferences over time. We added a whole new section to the study based on all this feedback."</p><p>To understand the phenomenon, Corbett and Munneke asked participants in the study to complete a questionnaire to understand their background and partake in an experiment around spatial awareness.</p><p>"They had to mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical 'Simon effect' where it's harder to respond when a target is on the opposite vs. the same side of the screen as the response button," Corbett said. "Then we used some machine-learning algorithms to help us sort through all this survey and experiment data and pick out what combination of all of these things best explained whether someone inverted."</p><p>According to Corbett, the assumptions for why people prefer inverted controls were wrong. Instead, the biggest determining factor was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and ​​overcome the Simon effect.</p><p>"The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert," Corbett said. "People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks. Though [non-inverters] tended to be faster, they didn't get the correct answer more than inverters who were actually slightly more accurate."</p><p>Essentially, just because a flight simulator may have been your first experience with a game doesn't mean you're inherently an inverter. Similarly, just because you've always played with normal controller settings doesn't mean you're a non-inverter either. In fact, according to the study and Corbett's musings, switching your preferences could make you a better gamer.</p><p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try--and inverters should give non-inversion another shot,” Corbett said. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn't mean they won't learn another way even better. A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don't realise they're naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p><p>Next time you're contemplating your controller settings, whether you should go with your preference (either inverting or not inverting), you may want to reconsider the other option. It could help you last longer in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

                <p>The Borderlands franchise is known for its recurring characters, and perhaps none stand out quite as much as Claptrap. This loud and eccentric little robot has long since stood as the series' mascot for good reason, with his endearing charm and infectious good mood. But there's no denying he can be a bit loud at times--and that certainly hasn't changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>. But what if you could change that?</p><p>Claptrap may not be as prevalent in this new entry as he has been in some other titles in the looter shooter franchise, but his presence is still consistent enough in Borderlands 4 to warrant a rather unique slider among all the other settings. For those who find this quirky guy more of a nuisance than a lovable goof, Gearbox has added a way to adjust his volume separately from all other volumes. Yeah, you can shut Claptrap up altogether if you want.</p><p>We can sense your excitement, so we'll tell you how to turn down Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4.</p><h2>How to turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4</h2><p>To turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4, pause the game and head to the "Options" menu. Scroll over one time to "Audio", then select "Advanced". On this menu, scroll to the very bottom to find a setting called "Claptrap?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631"></a><figcaption>You can adjust Claptrap's volume to make him more tolerable, or you can reduce it to zero to shut him up entirely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, you can adjust Claptrap's voice to make him quieter, or you can decrease the volume to zero so you'll never hear a peep from him again. You'll still be able to read his subtitles so that you know what he's saying when you pick up certain collectibles or engage in quests with him, so you're not really missing anything by turning him all the way down.</p><p>Whether you decide to mute Claptrap is entirely up to you, but don't ever tell him you've taken these measures. He may be slightly annoying sometimes, but the poor little guy doesn't deserve to have his feelings hurt.</p>

                <p>Overwatch 2 developer Blizzard has responded to accusations that new sprays for the competitive hero shooter were created with AI, firmly denying such claims.</p><p>Fans of the game took to platforms such as X and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1nj3hv2/overwatch_artist_using_ai_for_spray_art_creation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, pointing out what they perceived as telltale signs that the sprays depicting cartoony versions of Venture, Juno, and the game's new Hero Wuyang were AI-generated.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968109749507072419" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One user on X</a> cited the "hair and line art" in a spray showing Venture and Juno posing back-to-back, and <a href="https://x.com/DewEnjoyer/status/1968888604727419061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another user claimed</a> that there were "weird errors and strange details that'd be odd for an industry artist to make," such as one of Juno's eyebrows being over her hair while the other being under.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a Blizzard spokesperson said: "The sprays referenced are artist-made."</p><p>This is far from the first AI accusation that Blizzard has received relating to Overwatch 2. In August, a post from the official Overwatch X account promoting the brand's collaboration with figurine and plush company Youtooz contained what observers believed to be AI art in the background.</p><p>The post was subsequently deleted, with a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1953595482623947063" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply from the Overwatch account</a> clarifying that the art came from Blizzard's "e-commerce vendor," adding that the company "expect[s] images such as this to be artist-made, in alignment with our policy."</p><p>In April, players accused Blizzard of including AI-generated voice lines in the German localization of the game for Mercy in a Gundam crossover event. A public relations manager for Blizzard <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/the-new-german-mercy-ai-voice-is-an-outrageous-disgrace/962881/94" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded in the Blizzard forums</a>, denying the accusation and saying that "certain localized voice lines in some recent Blizzard game content are currently unavailable or changed."</p><p>The use of AI in game development still remains a contentious issue, with fans often backlashing at any possible case of AI-generated content, while AAA companies such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741">Sony continue to experiment with AI tools</a> such as large language models (LLMs). Back in 2023, reports indicated that Blizzard itself created an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-set-to-unveil-its-own-ai-tool-for-concept-art/1100-6514464/" data-ref-id="1100-6514464">AI tool called Blizzard Diffusion</a> to generate concept art.</p>
