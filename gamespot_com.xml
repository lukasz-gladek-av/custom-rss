                <p>Call of Duty: Warzone launched five years ago this month, and to celebrate the anniversary, Activision is going back to where it all began. On April 3, Warzone will bring back the OG map: Verdansk.</p><p>Ahead of this, Activision released a nostalgia-themed trailer set to "Unforgettable" by Nat King Cole. The CG trailer calls back to Warzone's earliest days, showing off some of the locations that are set to return. It ends with a soldier looking directly into the camera, with a tear streaming down his face as he smiles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX2LeqDlkBg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OX2LeqDlkBg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Warzone follows in the footsteps of other popular battle royale games Fortnite and Apex Legends, which also brought back their OG maps. In the case of Fortnite, this was extremely popular, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-og-breaks-its-all-time-player-records-at-launch/1100-6518929/" data-ref-id="1100-6518929">helping propel the game to its highest player count ever.</a></p><p>The arrival of Verdansk in Warzone could be a pivotal moment for the game. A report said if the arrival of this map fails to retain existing players and/or bring lapsed players back, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2026-could-drop-last-gen-systems-and-make-other-big-changes-report/1100-6529841/" data-ref-id="1100-6529841">there will be no "Warzone 3."</a></p><p>With Warzone going back in time with the arrival of Verdansk, many fans are wondering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-10-best-guns-we-hope-return-with-verdansk/2900-6307/" data-ref-id="2900-6307">what weapons might return as well</a>.

                <p>EA and DICE recently conducted the first public test for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and while participants were prohibited from sharing their gameplay footage online, the participants shared their gameplay footage online anyway. Some of the latest clips to emerge reveal that Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, features the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety.</p><p>This would be a brand-new feature for the series, but it's not confirmed for the game, of course, as the Battlefield Labs test is not necessarily representative of gameplay and features that will be in the final product. In any event, you can see this new feature in action in the clip below.</p><p>Another piece of footage shows a player getting thumped by a bolt-action sniper, with the player flying backwards in response to the hit. It looks pretty devastating in action, but again, it's not necessarily confirmed for the final version of the game. As you can tell from these gameplay clips and others--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982">which have highlighted gunplay and destruction</a>--Battlefield 6 is still very much a work in progress.</p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to get into a future test. Battlefield 6 has been rumored to release in Fall 2025, but EA has only confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">it'll be out by March 2026</a>. CEO Andrew Wilson recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-sounds-like-battlefield-6s-release-date-will-avoid-gta-6/1100-6529258/" data-ref-id="1100-6529258">EA could shift the game to potentially avoid a clash with GTA 6.</a></p><p>In addition to multiplayer, the next Battlefield game will have a single-player component developed by Motive and an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">unannounced mode from Ripple Effect that is rumored to be the return of Portal mode.</a></p>

During the new look at the game, a character by the name of Neil--played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli--was introduced. While his dark past with the Bridges organization was teased, it's the brief moment where Neil dons a bandana that had Metal Gear Solid fans pointing at their screens:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456523"></a><figcaption>Solid Snake, is that you?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456523-death-starnding-snake.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456524,1300-4456522" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4456524-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456522-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"></figure><p>As seen in the image above, Neil looks remarkably similar to Solid Snake once he dresses up for a fight. Back in a 2020 Instagram post, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kojima mentioned that Marinelli</a> would be the "spitting image" of Snake if he ever decided to wear the character's bandana, and it looks like that prediction has come true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2</a>.</p><p>What's also interesting to note here is that the character is flanked by several soldiers, similar to how Death Stranding's antagonist Clifford Unger would surround himself with troops whenever he appeared in the game. That suggests that Neil has died and has become a post-death entity, someone who finds himself driven to complete his unfinished business and can journey to battlefield beaches.</p><p>Another reference to Metal Gear Solid can be seen in the brief scene where Heartman takes control of the DHV Magellan submersible, fusing it with a gigantic entity from the tar to take on other titans. Yoji Shinkawa, who was the art director on 1998's Metal Gear Solid, also worked on Death Stranding 2 so it's not too surprising to see a few visual callbacks with the design of the Magellan.</p><p>There's also a hint of Pacific Rim in the control interface here for Magellan Man, which is a nice allusion to the film's director and Deadman's visual inspiration, Guillermo del Toro.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456525"></a><figcaption>Magellan Man is ready to rumble.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456525-deathstranding2%284%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4456528,1300-4456526,1300-4456527" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456528-deathstranding2%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456526-deathstranding2%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4456527-deathstranding2%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch for PS5 on June 26, and anyone who purchases the digital deluxe or collector's edition can start playing two days early on June 24.</p>
