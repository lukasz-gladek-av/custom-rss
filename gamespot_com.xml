                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s biggest day of the year started off with a massive live event that wrapped up Chapter 6, and if all goes well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-chapter-7/2900-7289/" data-ref-id="2900-7289">Chapter 7</a> will begin very soon. In the meantime, though, Fortnite's servers are offline for maintenance and to deploy the Chapter 7 update. There's no bug here--Fortnite is offline on purpose. But it shouldn't be down for long.</p><h2>When will Fortnite Chapter 7 start?</h2><p>In the past, the start of a new chapter came with longer periods of downtime--like a day or more--but these days Epic tends to treat new season and new chapter updates the same as it would a regular mid-month patch. That means you can expect Fortnite to be offline for between 4 and 7 hours, with Chapter 7 likely launching <strong>in the evening on Saturday, November 29, likely around 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET</strong>. Prime time, in other words.</p><p>We guarantee nothing, however, as these launches don't always go smoothly. Just a month ago, when the Simpsons season began, all seemed well when Fortnite returned from maintenance--but after an hour, the servers crashed and the game went back offline for a while. And there was another update earlier this year that ended up taking Fortnite offline for an entire additional day. But such incidents are rare, and most updates go off without major hitches.</p><p>When Chapter 7 launches, it'll come with a pretty loaded battle pass, teased by Epic to feature Marty McFly from Back to the Future and Beatrix "The Bride" Kiddo from Kill Bill. </p>
