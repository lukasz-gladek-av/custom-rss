The official PC specs for the game are now live, and while it's not too demanding in terms of RAM, GPU, and CPU requirements, you will need to ensure that you have 150GB of SSD storage capacity available.</p><p>Like several other modern games, Stalker 2 lists a solid-state drive as a mandatory requirement, likely due to them having vastly superior read/write speeds when compared to traditional hard disk drives. Developer GSC Game World has previously spoken about how it has attempted to create a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-is-a-frightening-but-alluring-return-to-the-zone-hands-on-preview/2300-6465350/" data-ref-id="2300-6465350">photorealistic version of the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone</a>, and early previews of Stalker 2 have shown off a lush environment for players to explore.</p><p>Beyond that, the rest of the PC requirements <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listed on Steam</a> are very forgiving toward older machines, possibly as a result of Stalker 2 being in development for a long period of time. GSC Game World recommends an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU with at least 8GB of VRAM and 16GB of RAM, although it's worth noting that the system requirements didn't list what kind of graphical output players can expect. If you're aiming for a 4K resolution and high frame rates, you'll likely want newer hardware to get the best out of Stalker 2.</p><h2>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl PC Requirements</h2><h3>Minimum</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 5 1600X / Intel Core i5-7600K</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 8GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 150GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD</li></ul><h3>Recommended</h3><ul><li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10, Windows 11</li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> AMD Ryzen 7 3700X / Intel Core i7-9700K</li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 16GB RAM</li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 SUPER 8GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti 11GB</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 150GB available space</li><li><strong>Additional Notes:</strong> SSD</li></ul><p>"Navigating anomalies, navigating the open world and its mysteries, and navigating the politics of different competing factions all have me excited for Stalker 2. Its atmosphere of deadly, mysterious strangeness makes wandering its open world both alluring and frightening," Phil Hornshaw wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-is-a-frightening-but-strangely-alluring-return-to-the-zone/1100-6527182/" data-ref-id="1100-6527182">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl preview</a>. "Stalker 2 perfectly balances the desire to discover what's hidden out there, like a field full of whispering poppies, with the unnerving knowledge that the Zone is also full of things that can and likely will kill you."</p><p>After several delays following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Stalker 2 will launch for PC and Xbox Series X|S on November 20, and it'll be available through Xbox Game Pass as well. If you're interested in seeing just how the game came together while Ukraine was thrown into chaos, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/documentary-shows-stalker-2-is-an-element-of-resistance-amid-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/1100-6526873/" data-ref-id="1100-6526873">you can check out a 90-minute documentary</a> from GSC Game World chronicling the last two years of development during uncertain times.</p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed Death Stranding 2: On The Beach's title screen with a tantalizing teaser, but no one should get too attached to it just yet. Kojima clarified that the title screen is "still very much temporary."</p><p>Right now, the screen features the game's name and a background image of Norman Reedus' character, Sam Porter, and a baby. The title screen has options for "Continue," "New Game," "Load Game," "Options," and "Recap of Death Stranding." That last one might be handy for anyone who needs a refresher on the events of the 2019 game, which had a narrative full of twists, turns, and <a href="https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Conan O'Brien. </a></p><p>In another update, Kojima shared an image of his work desk featuring a very comfy-looking chair. A second image appears to show multiple Death Stranding 2 save files.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 follows Sam and his companions as they embark on "a new journey to save humanity from extinction." Players will travel through a world full of "otherworldly enemies" and obstacles, while players will also face existential questions throughout the story, according to the game's description.</p><p>As mentioned, Reedus returns in the lead role, while Lea Seydoux comes back to play Fragile. Troy Baker, meanwhile, returns as Higgs. Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna join the sequel in new roles.</p><p>As for when we might see or learn more about Death Stranding 2, that remains to be seen. Kojima revealed Death Stranding 2 at his good friend Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards in December 2022. Some are expecting more information about the sequel to come at the 2024 edition of the show this December.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is set for release on PS5 at some point in 2025. Kojima is also developing an Xbox-exclusive game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, along with an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint.</a></p>
