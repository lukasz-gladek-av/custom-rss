                <p dir="ltr">Typing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/">an Xbox controller</a> on Windows 11--especially handheld devices--should become easier with a new update rolling out. That's because Microsoft is bringing controller functionality found on Xbox Series X|S for keyboards to Windows 11.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632342/microsoft-windows-11-gamepad-keyboard-xbox-controller-available-now" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> reports all Windows 11 users should see the new Xbox controller feature in the coming weeks. Not only will there be a gamepad-specific layout for touch keyboards, but there will be controller shortcuts too, such as pressing X for backspace or Y for space. This should sound familiar to Xbox console owners when typing on the system. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3613-to-the-release-preview-channel/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft's official language</a> for the update is below:</p><p dir="ltr">"We have enabled the gamepad keyboard layout for the touch keyboard in Windows 11. This change introduces the ability to use your Xbox controller to navigate and type. This includes button accelerators (example: X button for backspace, Y button for spacebar) additionally the keyboard keys have been vertically aligned for better controller navigation patterns."</p><p dir="ltr">Considering this controller support works with Windows 11 mobile devices, this could add fuel to the fire about a recent report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">an Xbox-branded handheld is planned to release later this year</a>. Microsoft is possibly partnering with Asus on the device, which would run Windows and sport Xbox aesthetics. Additionally, Microsoft is apparently also internally developing an Xbox handheld that's eyeing a 2027 launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-is-an-intriguing-idea-to-phil-spencer/1100-6522161/">Phil Spencer has talked about an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, even noting he wants current PC handhelds "to feel like an Xbox." That also parallels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">a marketing push to remind people that Xbox is more than just a singular console</a>.</p>

When the elevator doors open after that, players controlling Zoe and Mio are thrust into a platforming level guarded by moving lasers that seems like it was made by the most sadistic Super Mario Maker creators.</p><p>A pair of Chinese players, sharkOvO and E1uM4y, were <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/?spm_id_from=888.80997" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the first to post the video</a> of their successful run through the Laser Hell. As a reward, a video of Hazelight founder Josef Fares congratulates the viewer and admits that many in their office can't beat the level. He also invited the first fans to complete Laser Hell to the studio's headquarters in Sweden to see Hazelight's next game, which is still in development. Fares later congratulated sharkOvO and E1uM4y on social media and confirmed that they had earned their trip before promising to reach out.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Congrats to ‚ÄùsharkOvO‚Äù and ‚ÄùE1uM4y‚Äù for finishing the secret challenge ‚ÄùLaser Hell‚Äù in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#splitficton</a>.

That's because many quest objectives aren't readily shown on the map. Instead, you're given general directions and hints as to the whereabouts of your quarry. In the same vein, you'll spend a lot of time hunting down your targets: the members of the Shinbakufu group.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-tea-merchant-imai-sokyu-and-kosode-in-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530221/" data-ref-id="1100-6530221">The Golden Teppo: Imai Sokyu, the Tea Merchant, and the Kosode</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-confront-otama-or-wakasa/1100-6530232/" data-ref-id="1100-6530232">The Golden Teppo: Should you confront Otama or Wakasa</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-ise-sadatame-messenger/1100-6530222/" data-ref-id="1100-6530222">The Fool: Ise Sadatame and the Messenger</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-twisted-tree-takahashi-spare-kill/2900-6335/" data-ref-id="2900-6335">The Fool: The Twisted Tree quest and the Takahashi Clan</a></p><p>We'll continue adding more articles to our Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub, so stay tuned.</p>

                <p>They say diamonds are forever, but Nintendo 3DS game carts might be ready to give that precious material a run for its money. One Pokemon Sun player discovered just how durable the 3DS cart for the game was, as after it appeared to be lost for several years, they located it in their yard and found that it still worked fine.</p><p>"I was cleaning outside and I found this, it's my copy of Pokemon Sun from middle school,‚Äù user Lzzz4 shared on the Pokemon Sun and Moon subreddit (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/nintendo-3ds-6-years-332065/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-sun-cartridge-3ds-lost-alolan-raichu-rowlet-1851770957" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). "Last time [it] saved [was] November 7, 2018, that's probably around the time I lost it, that means its been outside for about six years and it still works."</p><hr><hr><p>While the cartridge did show some obvious signs of wear and tear from being outside for seven years--and the game label was missing--the original save data was still present. Lzzz4's team of Pokemon were ready to resume their journey in the Alolan region, and with over 100 hours logged in the game, they had amassed quite the collection of pocket monsters.</p><p>After a long break, the next big entry in the Pokemon franchise will be out later this year. Pokemon Legends Z-A has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">release window of late 2025</a>, and last month's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6286/">Pokemon Presents livestream</a> revealed more details for upcoming events in several of the free-to-play mobile Pokemon games. Outside of the video games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gotta-build-em-all-lego-teases-pokemon-sets/1100-6530179/">Lego has also teased its first Pokemon set</a>, with the first image for this collaboration featuring a glimpse at series mascot Pikachu.</p>
