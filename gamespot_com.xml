                <p>The Last of Us fans will soon be able to read the complete story in script format thanks to a new book from Dark Horse.

The sequel was co-written by Druckmann and Halley Gross. The duo, alongside Craig Mazin, most recently penned the scripts for the final two episodes of The Last of Us Season 2 for HBO.</p><p>This will probably be a fascinating book to pore over and have by your side during your next playthrough. But it might be of even greater interest to aspiring game writers. Scripts, like many areas of game development, aren't talked about by developers or publishers. Unless you work in the industry, chances are you've never had access to a script for a AAA game until now.</p></div>                      </div><p>The fact that this book exists at all is honestly pretty remarkable--unprecedented, even. We couldn't find a single other full video game script in book format. The closest published example we thought of was <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Skyrim-Library-Volumes-III-Box/dp/1783293233?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Skyrim Library</a>, a three-volume series compiling all of the written lore found in The Elder Scrolls V.</p><p>The reality is that many AAA games simply wouldn't make sense to release in book format from a financial perspective. Games with choice-based dialogue trees, branching paths, open worlds, and hundreds of NPCs, and enormous lists of side content would simply require far too many pages across multiple books.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537894"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us series for PlayStation 5</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4537894-thelastofusgames.png"></figure><p>The Last of Us, on the other hand, sets up particularly well for this format. No other game has been described as cinematic or referred to as an "interactive movie" as frequently as The Last of Us. Heck, many of the scenes in HBO's adaptation are pulled straight from the game, no interpretation required.</p><hr><p>The Last of Us doesn't have choice-based dialogue, branching paths, or a sprawling open world to explore. The gameplay experience in the first game is essentially scripted. The sequel is more dynamic, granting players more freedom to approach combat encounters and puzzles in different ways. But much like Naughty Dog's Uncharted 4, the "open" set pieces are still fundamentally linear.</p><p>This doesn't mean that the scripts will read just like a screenplay or teleplay. There are still lots of interactive components to the worlds of each game that will naturally be found amidst conversations between Joel and Ellie. All of the text that fills the space between lines of dialogue should be illuminating. Chances are fans will glean new insights from the text.</p><p>Screenplays, which are typically 90-120 pages, aren't published nearly as often as they once were, but occasionally we see teleplay collections for popular TV shows. HBO's The Last of Us adaptation isn't one of them--at least not yet--but HBO has recent experience publishing scriptbooks for its shows.

                <p>In June, Capcom announced a second fan-art contest for Street Fighter 6, where artists could submit entries for a chance to have their art inserted into the game for use in the "Here Comes A New Challenger" screen. A winner was chosen for each of the 26 current roster members, but the winning entry for newcomer Kimberly has stirred up some controversy--namely, allegations that the artwork broke the contest's strict "no AI-generated images" policy.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-kimberly-ai-art-contest-lilithascends-1851786882" rel="nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, an X user named "hoodratt20xx" put together a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRuYXWbOATa7jxlopgSXwR41pEHKB14zA0oJYjCnPWYwjuzBSRpBOgAEFyLtGZoNdZqMJHDO6KOiWs3/pub" rel="nofollow ">comprehensive Google Doc</a> of what they think are telltale signs of AI use in the winning Kimberly entry as well as entries for other characters. Another X user, Galena_Bismon, shared a similar<a href="https://x.com/Galena_Bismon/status/1948190589461168219" rel="nofollow "> analysis</a> via a post on their feed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537874"></a><figcaption>Kimberly from Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4537874-sf6-cover.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I have reason to believe that one of the winning entries for New Challengers 2 is partially or fully made with AI," hoodratt20xx wrote in the document. "I don’t make these accusations lightly and honestly would love to be proven wrong.

                <p>After similar pressure was placed on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/" data-ref-id="1100-6533253">Steam</a> just last week, another storefront, Itch.io, has followed suit and culled the vast majority of its adult and sexual content. It cites the efforts of the organization Collective Shout, the same group that also went after Steam, as the primary reason for the removal of said games.</p><p>Rumblings of these removals picked up late on July 23, when creators started noticing that games with NSFW tags had been "shadowbanned" on the platform, while some others noted that their games had been entirely pulled. In the early hours of July 24, Itch.io shared a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> confirming the removals and clarifying the circumstances that led to the sweeping changes.</p><p>The statement begins, "We have 'deindexed' all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change."</p><p>It continues, "Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted in Itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on Itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and Itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms."</p><p>In both situations, Collective Shout seemingly organized against the storefronts by pressuring their payment processors. Earlier this month, the group penned an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> to these companies accusing them of selling games with sexual-abuse material for profit.</p><p>Itch.io's statement suggests that the "situation developed rapidly" and that the company could not realistically have provided advanced notice to affected creators. It also goes on to say that the company is undergoing a "comprehensive audit of content" to make sure that the content on the store is in compliance with terms that will now be set by its payment processors. Moving forward, the pages that had been "deindexed" will remain as such throughout this audit and all future content tagged as NSFW on the platform will have to undergo further verification.</p><p>These changes come as a blow to Itch.io, which has developed a positive reputation among independent developers in recent years as a bastion for adult and queer content including games and zines. Additionally, the platform has famously implemented a "pay what you want" model that has enabled creators to make more profit and raise money for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-ice-in-california-bundle-raises-defense-funds-with-560-games-for-10/1100-6533022/" data-ref-id="1100-6533022">charity and humanitarian work</a>.</p><p>In response to Itch.io's sweeping changes though, many of its creators and loudest proponents are currently scrambling and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magicariot.com/post/3luoubs5gu22s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">weighing their futures</a> on the platform, as well as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sjklapecki.itch.io/post/3luohh5kf4s2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">organizing against payment processors</a> to push back on bans they feel are unfairly broad.</p>
