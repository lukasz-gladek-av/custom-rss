                <p>One of the most-anticipated upcoming features for the soccer game Rematch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play support</a>, has been delayed. Developer Sloclap announced today that the update has been pushed to an unspecified point in the future after the team discovered an issue. The patch was set to be released this week, so the last-minute delay is frustrating some fans.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1963629952139424001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Sloclap said its "final tests" found a "major matchmaking issue" related to cross-play, and that's why it's delaying the update.</p><p>"Since cross-play is the heart of Patch 3, we've decided to delay the release while we fix it. We know this is disappointing and we're truly sorry for the repeated delays. Thank you for your patience and support. We'll share a new update as soon as we have more news," the developer said.</p><p>This is actually a second delay for the cross-play update, as Sloclap was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-patch-notes-detail-whats-new-cross-play-update-coming-soon/1100-6533965/" data-ref-id="1100-6533965">originally aiming to launch it by the end of August.</a></p><p>In addition to cross-play, Patch 3 for Rematch will make some gameplay changes, including tweaks to the volley system. "This will also remove certain situations in which players seemed to be moving very fast towards their volley target, which felt both unrealistic and unfair," the developer said</p><p>Additionally, Patch 3 reduces the power boost that stems from the aerial extra effort volley shot.</p><p>Rematch launched in June and reached more than 5 million players after a month, but the $30 game hasn't necessarily sold that many copies, as it's also available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>. The game takes place decades in the future and there are no fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, ties, or shootouts.</p>

                <p>Players can finally get their hands on the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and with its launch also comes the release of the game's soundtrack.</p><p>Composer Christopher Larkin shared the link to the soundtrack, which is <a href="https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-silksong-original-soundtrack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to purchase on Bandcamp</a> for $11.99. The Silksong soundtrack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928720/Hollow_Knight_Silksong__Official_Soundtrack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also for sale on Steam</a> at the same price, but users can buy both the game (normally $20) and the soundtrack at a discounted $25.58.</p><p>The Silksong soundtrack contains 53 tracks, compared to the original Hollow Knight soundtrack, which included 26 tracks. Another music release titled "Hollow Knight: Gods &amp; Nightmares" had 15 tracks from the original game's DLC. That's all to say that Silksong has a larger soundtrack than both the original game and its DLC combined.</p><p>Both the Hollow Knight soundtrack and the Gods &amp; Nightmares release are also streaming on Spotify and Apple Music, though there has been no official word at this time about any streaming debut for the Silksong soundtrack. The original Hollow Knight soundtrack even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Original-Soundtrack-Limited/dp/B07RWDS264?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">received a vinyl record release</a>, which is still available.</p><p>Larkin also composed the music for the original Hollow Knight and its DLC. His video game discography also includes the soundtracks for Pac-Man 256, Outfolded, and the upcoming Moonlighter 2. As described on <a href="https://composerlarkin.com/portfolio-item/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Larkin's personal website</a>, the Silksong musical score "extend[s] on the established musical world of Hollow Knight from soft melancholic pieces to soul thumping, heart racing boss themes and beyond."</p><p>Of course, fans can also hear this music through playing the game itself, which they certainly are, as the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-big-launch/1100-6534482/" data-ref-id="1100-6534482">reached high concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>. The explosive launch of the game even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">caused technical issues</a> for the Steam, PSN, Xbox, and Nintendo eShop stores.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>As a game that's constantly evolving, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> is no stranger to hotfixes and patches. In fact, a new update has just gone live, and it is designed to quickly address several issues that have cropped up in the game since the start of the Into the Unjust event in the game. This new patch focuses primarily on game-breaking issues causing hard crashes, as well as buffs to the new gear introduced in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952">Dust Devils warbond</a>.</p><p>For general fixes, players can expect several problems to be addressed. Developer Arrowhead says that the crashes related to there being too many particle effects, Automaton missions, and a bug with a seeking missile have been resolved with this patch. Other tweaks include the extraction shuttle landing more safely for players, hive world tunnels should no longer be darker than intended if you're using lower graphics settings, and the excessive light emitted by the Hellpad has also been toned down.</p>

      </div>
<p>When it comes to weapons and stratagems, there have also been a few issues here. The LIFT-182 Warp Pack tended to make players get stuck midair, and there were also instances of the game crashing when a player aborted a mission while wielding a turret or driving a vehicle. These should all be fixed here, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">and it should also be safe to equip the Halo ODST MA5C assault rifle</a> when you're on the bridge of your flagship.</p><p>For the buffs, Arrowhead is reducing the cooldown on the MS-11 Solo Silo and giving the S-11 Speargun a quicker reload. The silo stratagem cooldown will now drop from 210 seconds to 180 seconds, while the Speargun reload time has been cut by an entire second to just 2.5 seconds. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">A larger patch released earlier this week</a> also killed several bugs, allowing players more freedom so that they could also go on a bug hunt.

You'll have to carefully measure every action you take as you aim to prevent the extinction of humanity, while also being forced to make hard choices along the way. There's a time-travel element as well, so if things get too tough, you can always rewind time and start from the beginning in a new timeline.</p><p>For a grander tactical experience, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-iv/">Sid Meier's Civilization 4</a> will scratch your itch for 4X strategy as you take your chosen nation from rags to riches, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/afterimage/">Afterimage</a> is a hand-drawn 2D action adventure that emphasizes fast-paced combat, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/residual/">Residual</a> will see you explore a procedurally generated alien world.</p><p>As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires.
