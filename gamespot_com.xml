                <p>Roger Clark, who voiced Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, has revealed his newest project--and it's out soon. It's not another western, but instead a game about cats.</p><p>Clark is lending his voice to Ultra Mega Cats, a PvE co-op shooter "where badass cats battle waves of enemies in explosive arenas." Clark is voicing the feline Clint, and he described his work on the game as <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934660290420822433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"another wild ride in the gaming world."</a> Clint is a cowboy cat who dual-wields pistols, so while this role is unexpected and very different, it does harken back to Clark's most famous role in Rockstar's Western.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCut0thGMIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCut0thGMIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultra Mega Cats has players controlling so-called Mega Cats, which are basically cats with super-abilities and incredible power.</p><p>"Imagine living in a world flipped upside down, where rodents and feathered forces rule and cats are shunned. You're one of the last cats standing--disgraced, brainwashed, and trained to serve your former prey as their personal killing machine," reads a line from the game's description. "But that is not enough, as the cat's soul knows no master!

                <p>Fortnite has lost its crown. Grow a Garden, the breakout game on Roblox, has broken the concurrent-player-count record. It broke over 16 million CCUs (concurrent users) over the weekend, beating out Fortnite by nearly two million. The battle royale held the previous record of 14.3 million.</p><p>Grow a Garden is an idle video game where a garden changes between sessions. Released in March, it has players plant crops and flowers and design their own garden. The plants will grow when they are offline, making for a nice surprise when they log back on.</p><p>"Grow a Garden has more players than New Zealand and Norway combined," wrote Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/comment/mxqxrim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agentsunnyside7_4</a> in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/grow_a_garden_has_now_broken_the_record_for_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a> that covered the huge player-count news. "If it [were] a country, it would be the 78th-most-populated country, behind Rwanda and above Burundi."</p><p>A recent promotion gave players a free pet if they were online when an update was released. They had to be online at the exact time the Working Bee update dropped in order to receive the Cooked Owl pet, giving a clear reason for why so many players were online over the weekend.</p><p>Grow a Garden--while not especially unique compared to similar titles--has captured the minds of millions of Roblox players. It's approachable with nearly no learning curve. It's resonated with players of all ages and has a huge audience in Asia.</p>

                <p>The cloud-gaming service Shadow, which provides cloud computational resources for gamers as well as professionals, has launched a new high-end machine. Called Neo, this new machine runs the equivalent of an Nvidia 4060 GPU and is a free upgrade for users who already subscribe to Shadow's high-end service.</p><p>The company states that this new cloud PC will facilitate "up to 150%" more performance in gaming-related tasks, alongside a 200% boost in "pro software" performance. Its new components enable more options for gamers, such as improved DLSS and ray tracing. In addition to the new GPU, the Neo PC has a CPU with eight vCores ranging between 3.25-3.8 GHz, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and is connected to a 1Gb/s network connection.</p><p>Neo will be rolled out for free to existing users of Shadow's previous Boost tier, while new users can subscribe for $38/month. This upgrade brings Shadow's offerings closer to its main competitor in the PC cloud-gaming space, Nvidia GeForce Now, which offers 4080-equivalent performance at its highest tier. While GeForce Now is considerably cheaper (at about $17/month), Shadow's main advantage is that it provides a full Windows experience. This means that users can directly access and download their full PC games libraries without restriction, as well as use any software that works on Windows.</p><p>Shadow has been around for a while, and it seems to have found a niche with gamers who also want to have access to computational resources for other tasks. While the company once experimented with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-game-streaming-offers-a-powerful-cloud-pc-b/1100-6465346/" data-ref-id="1100-6465346">offering its own set-top box</a>, it now emphasizes the accessibility of its app across many mobile and desktop operating systems.</p>

                <p>Two years ago, BattleBit Remastered caught on after its early-access release and it was briefly one of the most popular shooters online. BattleBit's player count had dramatically dropped since 2023 and the game was seemingly abandoned. Now, however, it appears the game could find a new lease on life with a forthcoming update.</p><p>A very short teaser for BattleBit Remastered's Operation Overhaul has been shared by the game's publisher and co-developer, SgtOkiDoki. There's not much to go in the clips, but it's the first sign of life that BattleBit has had in 18 months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> BattleBit Remastered - Operation Overhaul | Gameplay Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>SgtOkiDoki and fellow indie developers Vilaskis and TheLiquidHorse released BattleBit Remastered in June 2023, and players embraced its easy-to-play mechanics. What the game lacked in visual splendor, it made up for with destructible environments, relatively realistic depictions of weapons, 254-player lobbies, and large maps to explore. At its peak, BattleBit Remastered had 87,323 concurrent players.</p><p>BattleBit's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> hasn't been updated with any details about the update yet and it still has the notice from Valve that the game hasn't had any developer activity for a long time. The most recent peak for BattleBit's concurrent players was just over 1,000, which suggests most of the game's audience has moved on. It remains to be seen if the new update can revive interest in the title.</p><p>In 2023, GameSpot's Firearms Expert Reacts featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-battlebit-remastereds-guns-part-2/2300-6461878/" data-ref-id="2300-6461878">an extended look at BattleBit's depiction of weapons</a> and determined that they were largely true-to-life and realistic, despite the game's low-poly aesthetic.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, PC gaming's premier destination for mods, is changing hands after almost 24 years. Site founder Robin Scott, aka DarkOne, announced the change in ownership but didn't make clear who the new owners are.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on Nexus Mods, Scott doesn't explicitly state who the site's new owners are, only that it took many months of meetings and face-to-face talks to find a new owner that would "respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community." The new owners are focused on "long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform," Scott said, and that the site will continue to be "community-first and mod-author focused."</p><p>"So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal," Scott said. "This is me doing something I probably should've done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott cited burnout and health reasons for stepping away from running the site he founded. Scott said running the website since 2001 and always being "on call" has been an ongoing source of anxiety and "stress-related health issues." While the site was born out of personal excitement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/" data-ref-id="5000-2508">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, it later transformed into a business that consumed his life.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been rewarding, sometimes chaotic, often exhausting, and always personal," Scott said. "Somewhere along the way, I forgot to step back and breathe, or sleep properly. The dilemma of running a major social network that does not rest!"</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that his burnout and exhaustion began to have a negative effect on the site and the Nexus Mods team, making him come to the realization that the "best thing" for the future of Nexus Mods was to step aside and bring in new leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Scott is no longer the owner, he will still be involved in helping guide the overall direction of the site, just "without needing to be the person who signs off on every little thing." In terms of what will change, it doesn't seem like it will be much, at least according to Scott. He said he had already started stepping back in recent years and that the structural updates to the company's ownership are more of a formality to make sure the right people are in control to guide the site into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Modding, and Nexus Mods, has only continued to grow in the last two decades. Massive RPGs like Skyrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/" data-ref-id="2900-5217">Fallout 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods/2900-6512/" data-ref-id="2900-6512">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3</a> all having extensive modding communities that are made easily accessible thanks to sites like Nexus Mods, where mod creators can easily upload their creations and those looking to augment their games on PC can easily browse for new additions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to make the jump into the wild world of user-made mods, be sure to check out our round-up of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">best Skyrim mods to play in 2025</a>, as well as similar lists for popular mod-friendly games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-mods/2900-5480/" data-ref-id="2900-5480">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stardew-valley-mods/2900-5735/" data-ref-id="2900-5735">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>

The new Amiibo released on June 5, so the June 23 release date specifically applies to Amazon. Similarly, a few of the games above are listed as "temporarily out of stock," as Amazon is clearly still working to stock its Nintendo inventory.</p><p>Neither Amazon nor Nintendo has ever commented on what led to the removal of all first-party Nintendo products from sale at the online retail giant. Amazon stopped selling Nintendo Switch games in early 2024. Before long, all of Nintendo's most popular games, official accessories, and even Switch Online subscriptions were removed from sale. This also happened at Walmart around the same time, but Walmart and Nintendo resolved their differences before the holiday season.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>   </ul> </div>
