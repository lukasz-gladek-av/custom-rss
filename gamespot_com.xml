                <p dir="ltr">After several years of plundering Lost Sectors to kill pumpkin-headed bosses, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> players will have some new spooky activities to complete when this year's Festival of the Lost rolls around.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie mentioned a few changes coming to Destiny's yearly Halloween event during its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">Renegades expansion</a>. Alongside the yearly drops of themed cosmetic armor and special weapons, developers mentioned both a new six-player PvE activity and a three-player PvP activity.</p><p dir="ltr">The six-player activity is called Haunted Altars, and according to Destiny design lead Clayton Kisko, it sees the Headless Ones--huge Halloween-themed boss monsters who sport pumpkins where their heads used to be--finally escaping from the Lost Sectors where they've been holed up for previous festivals. As for the PvP activity, it's called Red Rumble. Bungie didn't provide any details as to what the activities will actually be, but they should shake up the formula of raiding Lost Sectors, which has been the mainstay activity since back before the release of the Beyond Light expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">This year also sees the return of "hocus-focusing," which allows you to pick the loot you'll receive during the event. You'll need Eerie Engrams, which drop from Festival activities, and Candy, the currency you'll get throughout the Festival of the Lost period. Hocus-focusing allows you to receive specific weapons from the Festival loot pool, or to grab Exotic gear, as long as you have the Candy to pay for it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564623"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2's Festival of the Lost armor for 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564623-destiny2festivalofthelost2025armor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alongside a few new details about Destiny 2's Halloween celebration, Bungie also showed off this year's Festival of the Lost cosmetic armor ornaments, which are themed around pop-culture killers. Players voted between armor sets themed on Slashers and Specters back in January, but it seems as though Bungie combined elements of both groups into the final armor set.</p><p dir="ltr">Hunters can grab armor themed around the look of a ghostly bride (which also blends in some of the Ghost Face-esque look inspired by the slasher from the Scream movies); Titans get a look inspired by hockey mask-wearing murderer Jason Vorhees of Friday the 13th; and Warlocks can dress up as a creature akin to the internet's favorite tall spindly faceless child-stalker, the Slenderman.</p><p dir="ltr">As usual, those armor ornaments will be available through the Eververse Store for Silver, Destiny 2's premium currency--so don't expect to earn them through gameplay.</p><p>Bungie ran down lots of details about Renegades during the livestream, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-power-grind-should-get-less-grindy-in-renegades-expansion/1100-6534592/">changes it's making to Destiny 2's loot and Power grind</a>, based on player feedback.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during its latest livestreamed reveal presentation, Apple unveiled the iPhone 17 and its four different models: iPhone 17, iPhone Air, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iphone-17-officially-announced-with-four-new-versions/1100-6534588/">"impossibly thin" iPhone Air</a> has grabbed headlines, each member of this new generation of iPhone features a pair of new tech additions that mobile gaming enthusiasts will particularly find interesting.</p><p dir="ltr">First is the new Super Retina XDR display, which not only features the Ceramic Shield 2 for better protection, but will also support ProMotion up to a 120Hz refresh rate. NetEase's free-to-play RPG Destiny Rising has been confirmed to be among the first iOS games to utilize the 120Hz tech.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564616"></a><figcaption>iPhone 17 Pro</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4564616-iphone-17-pro.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next is the vapor chamber cooling technology, which was also a feature of the Xbox One X. This cooling tech is designed to "enhance heat dissipation and performance" thanks to deionized water sealed inside the chamber, which is "laser-welded into the aluminum chassis to move heat away from the powerful A19 Pro, allowing it to operate at even higher performance levels," according to the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-unveils-iphone-17-pro-and-iphone-17-pro-max/" rel="nofollow ">official announcement</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Other gaming-relevant features found in the new set of iPhones include the A19 Pro chip, which sports a 6-core CPU and GPU architecture that Apple says will "deliver up to 40% better sustained performance than the previous generation." The new N1 wireless networking chip, meanwhile, will support Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, and Thread for online multiplayer games.</p><p dir="ltr">The iPhone 17 in all of its forms is set to launch September 19, with preorders scheduled to begin one week prior on September 12.</p>

For those playing on Steam, the demo will arrive as early as September 10.</p><p dir="ltr">It appears that the console versions of the demo will all be arriving at the same time, while PC will unlock at different times depending on the region. Below is the breakdown for when the demo will be released in various regions.</p><h3 dir="ltr">PS5, Xbox Series X|S</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">September 11  <ul><li dir="ltr">12 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">12 AM CEST</li><li dir="ltr">12 AM JST</li></ul></li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">Steam</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">September 10  <ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">September 11  <ul><li dir="ltr">12 AM CEST</li><li dir="ltr">7 AM JST</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">One big question fans have is whether or not progress made in the demo will carry over to the full game, and it's one we don't have an answer for at time of writing.

Producer Ryosuke Hara said the team looked to improve the games' battle system this time around to make it more balanced, resulting in what Reyes described as possibly the franchise's most comprehensive battle system yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Those interested don't need to have watched older Digimon shows or played the previous Digimon Story game, 2016's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth/" data-ref-id="5000-239106">Cyber Sleuth</a>, in order to understand this game's story, which revolves around a secret agent investigating a mysterious city-leveling explosion that is somehow connected to the digital world.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s loot grind is getting some major changes in its next expansion, including adjustments to make more activities more rewarding and to make gear more viable in the game's new Portal activity scoring system.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie announced several of the changes in its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cwlUS_JcarQ?si=ZeoppwP1tjmrSn4-" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">livestream</a> detailing the upcoming Renegades expansion, noting that many of them are responses to feedback from players in the wake of Destiny 2's Edge of Fate expansion. Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with balance changes and adjustments, Bungie also detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">what's coming in the Renegades expansion</a> and mentioned some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-festival-of-the-lost-is-getting-new-activities-check-out-the-armor/1100-6534597/" data-ref-id="1100-6534597">changes to Destiny 2's Halloween event</a>, the Festival of the Lost--and showed of this year's spooky armor sets.</p>

                <p>Some of the best games around borrow from those that set the standard before them, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311"> Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel, is no exception. Protagonist Hornet differs from the first game's Vessel in a number of ways but also features some familiar-looking animations that might remind you of one of the most influential metroidvanias of all time.</p><p>If you've enjoyed flicking Hornet about on the screen, you may have noticed a curious movement she makes when changing direction. Instead of the character model flipping to the new direction you're moving in, Hornet backsteps and looks like she's turning to face it instead. Line that up against Alucard in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/" data-ref-id="5000-632"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, and it's obvious where this inspiration came from.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was going to praise Silksong for having animations similar to Alucard's, but seeing them side by side, it's the same character controller lol (I love that, by the way) <a href="https://t.co/gQLJ2yNlwS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gQLJ2yNlwS</a></p>  — Wallace Pires (@h_wallacepires) <a href="https://twitter.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>More of Hornet's animations, such as her standard and diagonal air attacks, bear some similarity to Alucard's own, but it's the backstep that looks almost ripped out of Konami's classic and endearingly recreated in its modern contemporary. Team Cherry hasn't commented on the comparison yet, but it's a nice touch that longtime fans of the genre are bond to appreciate the most.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong hasn't been out for a week yet, but it's already made a massive impact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">bringing down several storefronts</a> at launch before going on to secure more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">5 million players in total</a>. It's already generated some discussion over its difficulty and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">received a balance update</a> that should make early encounters a little less punishing, as well as a hidden mode that makes skirmishes even more brutal.</p>

                <p>As part of Apple's big September event today, the company did what it usually does in September: announced a new iPhone. In fact, Apple unveiled four new iPhone models, including the "impossibly thin" iPhone Air and the more powerful iPhone 17 Pro. The others include the iPhone 17 Pro Max and a new base-model iPhone 17. All of them are launching on September 19, with preorders opening September 12.</p><p>Here are the starting prices at a glance, but note that prices go up based on the storage space you choose:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone 17</strong> -- $800</li><li><strong>iPhone Air</strong> -- $1000</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong> -- $1,100</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong> -- $1,200</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0au92yebLQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M0au92yebLQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>iPhone Air</h2><p>At 5.6mm, it's the thinnest iPhone that Apple has ever made. It features a 6.5-inch screen and is said to be durable thanks in part to being made with titanium (80% of which comes from recycled sources).</p><p>The iPhone Air comes in black, white, gold, and blue. It runs on the A19 Pro processor, which sets new stands for mobile phones, Apple said. The GPU, meanwhile, gets improved with a 5-core setup and baked-in AI acceleration features. Users can expect "Macbook Pro levels of compute," Apple said.</p><p>The camera takes 48 megapixel photos with one lens and an 18mp front-facing camera that includes a "center stage" feature that uses AI to find the best angles. A new feature, dual capture video, allows you to record yourself with the front-facing camera while recording with the back camera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580" data-ratio="0.56631171345595" data-width="2066" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580"></a><figcaption>The iPhone Air.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Apple said the internal design has been "completely redesigned" to maximum space for the battery itself. Apple promises "all-day battery life" for the iPhone Air. There is also a MagSafe battery accessory that people can buy to extend battery life.</p><h2>iPhone 17 Pro</h2><p>The iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery in any iPhone, a new camera system with "breathtaking range and resolution," and the most powerful chip Apple has ever made for an iPhone, the A19 Pro. It's designed to be extremely durable, Apple said, with new protections for the front and the back. It also has a better battery that can support up to 39 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p><p>Take a look for yourself:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586"></a><figcaption>The iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of the new cameras, they include the "best camera system we've ever made," Apple said, and they include the 18mp "center stage" camera on the front and three rear cameras--all are 48 megapixels. The "extended plateau" for the camera allows for the longest optical zoom Apple has ever made.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AS5DtDeqs" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_-AS5DtDeqs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><strong>iPhone 17 base model</strong></h2><p>The new line of iPhone 17 base-model phones will run on a new processor called A19, which is "faster and more efficient," Apple said. The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3-inch display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming. NetEase's Destiny: Rising will be among the games to support the 120Hz feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576" data-ratio="0.58842443729904" data-width="1866" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576"></a><figcaption>The four new iPhone 17 colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png"></figure><p>A big part of having a phone is taking photos of your dog with it, and the new iPhone 17 will feature a better camera that should take more impressive photos than before, Apple said. There is a new "center stage" camera, too, to help people take better selfies, videos, and more. You also no longer need to rotate your phone to take a selfie, and the camera uses AI to automatically select the best angles.</p><p>Below you can see a rundown of the iPhone 17 base model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578" data-ratio="0.58230256898192" data-width="2102" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578"></a><figcaption>A quick look at the special features of the iPhone 17.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png"></figure><p>Also during the Apple event, the company announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>The ambitious mod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">Skyblivion is still aiming to release in 2025</a>, according to the mod's developers, even as one former developer on the project called it quits after nine years, claiming it's "less of a passion project and more of a crunch project."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, which has been in development for 13 years, looks to recreate Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion in the more modern engine of its sequel, Skyrim. However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
