                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">finally returned to the App Store</a> in the US after a five-year long legal battle, and Epic is giving players a free skin to celebrate. In order to redeem the free Burnoff skin, all players have to do is log in to Fortnite on mobile, whether that's on Android or iPhone.</p><p>The new skin is a red and black motorbike outfit with flame motifs called Burnoff, which looks to be a reskin of the all-white Whiteout skin. To redeem the freebie, players will have to log in on Fortnite Mobile on either Android or iOS--though once the skin is acquired it can be used in all versions of Fortnite. The skin is available from now until June 17.</p><p>Despite Epic Games' recent win against Apple, which saw Fortnite reinstated on the App Store in the US by order of a California district court judge, the game still isn't available on iOS outside of the USA and the EU. It's unlikely that the legal drama between the two companies will end here, but for now fans can enjoy the spoils of Epic's victory.</p><p>Fortnite players can also grab the Iridia Vayne skin for free for a limited time, though that new skin requires <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-free-fortnite-skin-before-you-have-to-pay-for-it/1100-6531735/" data-ref-id="1100-6531735">a bit more work to earn</a> than just logging into the game.</p><p>Fortnite's current Star Wars season has just under two weeks left to go, with a dramatic live event scheduled to finish up the saga on Saturday June 7. While nothing has been officially announced yet, there are rumors that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-3-whats-next-after-star-wars-season-ends/1100-6531797/" data-ref-id="1100-6531797">next Fortnite season will be superhero themed</a>.</p>
