                <p>Ahead of the holiday season, and presumably to help drive sign-ups to Game Pass, Microsoft has rolled out a new ad campaign called "This Is An Xbox." The basic takeaway is that, as Microsoft has been saying for years, you don't have to buy an Xbox to play Xbox. That's because Xbox games are available across a variety of devices these days as part of Microsoft's new strategy to gain marketshare. Microsoft is, of course, is in third place against PlayStation and Nintendo.</p><p>Microsoft is going big for this ad campaign, with visuals set to appear in places like San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, London, New York, and Berlin. Microsoft also commissioned a live-action trailer featuring the song "The Choice Is Yours" by Black Sheep, which is rather fitting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYBSNQLsBKk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Additionally, Microsoft partnered with companies like Samsung, Crocs, Porsche, and The Happy Egg for branding takeovers. The ads first display a product, say, a pair of Crocs, with the message "This is a pair of Crocs," and the next page shows an Xbox and says, "This is an Xbox."</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft is launching a giant billboard for "This Is An Xbox" at Times Square in New York City later this year. Beyond all that, Microsoft is selling themed merch at the <a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Gear Shop</a>, including a t-shirt that says "This Is Not An Xbox," referring to the human wearing the shirt.</p><p>There is also an online quiz that asks people to identify what is and what is not an Xbox. It's a pretty fun and silly quiz, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/what-is-xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you can take it here.</a></p><p>This is a new ad campaign but the idea has been in place for years. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">Xbox's goal is to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but "playing on Xbox" doesn't mean a dedicated Xbox console. "It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be on an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," he said.</p><p>Game consoles usually do not make much money, and if they do, it's not a lot compared to the much more lucrative games and services. This is why Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass so hard.</a> Creating more subscribers gives Microsoft a regular and recurring revenue stream.</p><p>And Microsoft is all about making money. After Xbox's recent 2,500 layoffs, Spencer defended the cuts, saying they were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">necessary due to capitalism.</a></p>

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-is-an-intriguing-idea-to-phil-spencer/1100-6522161/" data-ref-id="1100-6522161">saying for a long time</a> that he wants to make an Xbox handheld device, and now he's brought it up once more.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation is that we would do something" in that area. Bloomberg reported that Microsoft is currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">working on prototypes</a> and thinking about the best way forward. The site also reported that Spencer said any potential Xbox handheld would be "a few years out."</p><p>For now, Microsoft's designers and engineers are spending time updating the Xbox mobile app to offer a better experience on portable gaming devices that already exist. But on a longer horizon, Spencer said, "I think our team could do some real innovative work" in the dedicated handheld market.</p><p>A report from September 2024 claimed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next-generation Xbox console could also support a dedicated gaming handheld device.</a> Microsoft is working on its next home console, saying the system will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history.</a></p><p>Microsoft stands apart from PlayStation and Nintendo in that it's the only one of the so-called Big Three that has never released a dedicated portable gaming device--it seems it won't be that way forever, though.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer talked about Microsoft's mobile game store, noting that it's been delayed to an unspecified point in the future. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-set-to-launch-mobile-games-store-this-july/1100-6523350/" data-ref-id="1100-6523350">previously expected to launch this past July. </a></p><p>Spencer also talked about the possibility of making more acquisitions, saying he's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-on-ps5-its-too-soon-to-say-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527732/" data-ref-id="1100-6527732">always considering options, but nothing is "imminent."</a> Additionally, Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-on-ps5-its-too-soon-to-say-phil-spencer-says/1100-6527732/" data-ref-id="1100-6527732">Halo 5 on PS5 has not been ruled out.</a></p>
