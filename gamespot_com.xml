                <p>The Indiana Jones movies may be over, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> may have more than enough content to satisfy fans of the films. According to MachineGames, the upcoming title will have nearly four hours of cut scenes, which is almost the length of two Indiana Jones movies.</p><p>MachineGames' creative director Axel Torvenius was a guest on the MinnMax YouTube channel, and he revealed that The Great Circle has "a lot" of cut scenes that when combined run "roughly three hours and 45 or 40 minutes or something along those lines." He added that it is "the biggest and longest game that MachineGames have ever done."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QyAVQjLi_s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3QyAVQjLi_s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Torvenius also indicated that the story of The Great Circle is largely unchanged from the outline that Bethesda director Todd Howard pitched to George Lucas in 2009, three years before Disney purchased Lucasfilm. Additionally, Torvenius stated that The Great Circle won't have instant fails during stealth missions, which is something that another game based on a Lucasfilm property, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, only recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/" data-ref-id="1100-6527925">fixed with a new patch</a>.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC on December 9. PlayStation 5 owners won't be left out, but they will have to wait until Spring 2025 to play the game. However, players of all consoles and computers can enjoy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-themed-menu-coming-to-ihop-as-custom-xbox-series-x-revealed/1100-6527736/" data-ref-id="1100-6527736">an Indiana Jones-themed menu</a> that is currently available in IHOP's International Bank of Pancakes restaurants across the country.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly working on an Animal Crossing-inspired game called Alterra. In the game, players will build their home on an island inhabited by NPCs called "Matterlings." Players can leave their home to discover new biomes, Matterlings, and materials out in broader environs.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-alterra-animal-crossing-inspired-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a> first reported on Alterra's development. According to the report, the game will use voxels to generate its world. For the unfamiliar, voxel graphics display cubes on a grid, a la Minecraft. Alterra is also set to feature building and crafting mechanics, letting players construct items and locations out of materials they find out in the world. The report claims Alterra was developed from a cancelled project which also used voxel graphics.</p><p>Insider Gaming claims they have seen images of Alterra's NPCs. The Matterlings are reported to resemble Funko Pops, i.e. cartoon figures with large heads, albeit in a voxel style. Some Matterlings resemble fictional creatures like dragons, others real-world animals like birds and polar bears.</p><p>The report asserts that Alterra is under development at Ubisoft Montreal. Patrick Redding (formerly lead on Gotham Knights) is the project's creative director. Fabien Lh√©raud--who has worked as a marketing, brand, and media manager at Ubisoft for over 20 years--is Alterra's lead producer. The report indicates that the game has been in development for 18 months and is likely still years away.</p>

                <p>It just became way less of a hassle to launch 2K games from your Steam library. The publisher has officially removed its launcher from every game that used it on Steam (and the Epic Games Store). The removal went through on November 18, but a follow-up update to ensure the Launcher was fully removed dropped on November 25.</p><p>Many games, including Bioshock Remastered, Marvel's Midnight Suns, and The Quarry, will now launch directly through Steam. Other games used the launcher for additional functionality. Those games will now launch a small submenu before opening the game itself.</p><p>For example, XCOM 2 and XCOM: Chimera Squad used the 2K launcher for mod management. Now, launching the game will open a small menu which will let you open the mod launcher or the selected game directly. For both games, this change lets you install and use mods on Steam Deck, though the Chimera Squad menu may have some graphical and interface glitches on the portable device.</p><p>Some files from the launcher may remain. The 2K launcher folder has been replaced with a text file entitled 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. You can also search for remaining files in your Windows search bar with the following text: "%localappdata%\T2GP Launcher" and "%appdata%\T2GP Launcher." You can find a more detailed tutorial for deleting the launcher's files on the <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/32209414429203--2K-Launcher-Removing-2K-Launcher-Files" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">2K support site</a>.</p><p>This update follows confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-wont-require-2k-launcher-on-pc/1100-6525824/" data-ref-id="1100-6525824">Civilization 7 would not require the 2K launcher</a>. The publisher may also be working on an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-is-reportedly-remaking-a-game-and-fans-are-filling-in-the-blanks/1100-6524755/" data-ref-id="1100-6524755">un-announced remake</a>, possibilities include Bioshock and Spec Ops: The Line.</p>

                <p>Activision continues to stock the Call of Duty in-game store with new bundles, and the latest lets you become a legally distinct version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Rocket Raccoon. Or at least that's what people are saying about the new "Cash Bandit" store bundle that went live today, November 26, for Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p>The bundle comes with the "Raccoon Goon" skin for Niran, along with the "Debt Collector" weapon skin for the Sirin 9mm special weapon that was recently released. There is also a "Vault Security" GPR 91 assault rifle blueprint included with the bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962"></a><figcaption>This is not Rocket Raccoon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg"></figure><p>The raccoon skin also includes a weapon reticle called "Cash Flow," along with a finishing move labeled "Disarmed." What's more, the bundle includes a raccoon-themed decal and weapon charm, as well as a one-hour double XP token. This DLC bundle costs 2,800 COD Points, which is about $20 USD.</p><p>This isn't the first Call of Duty store bundle that bears a resemblance to a Guardians of the Galaxy character.

This is more than just a brand-new map for Zombies in Black Ops 6, as Citadelle des Morts represents a key development in the ongoing Zombies narrative, as it merges some of the existing Treyarch storylines that had previously been unconnected. Here's what you need to know before the map arrives on December 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The final storyline cutscene for the Terminus map throws a bunch of names at you, and if you haven't played Black Ops 4 or Vanguard Zombies, these mentions may not mean anything to you, but for longtime fans this connects all of the stories in an intriguing way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Citadelle des Morts Zombies Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some spoilers ahead:</strong> The final Terminus cinematics reveals that Edward Richtofen has been seeking Prima Materia and the Sentinel Artifacts, which are the main elements of Treyarch's Chaos storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 introduced a completely new set of Zombies characters for the Chaos storyline, which, until now, has been unconnected to the Aether storyline that involves the original Zombies cast of Edward Richtofen, Takeo Masaki, Tank Dempsey, and Nikolai Belinsk. Black Ops 4's cast of Chaos characters chased down Sentinel Artifacts, which were relics created by an Earth-mined substance known as Prima Materia.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 4, Prima Materia is revealed as a substance that brought so much power that it corrupted and destroyed whole civilizations. It's no shock that Richtofen is seeking this kind of power, but it could have a catastrophic outcome if he gains possession of a Sentinel Artifact. It's also revealed that a Sentinel Artifact might be able to harness the power needed to bring back Samantha Maxis from the Dark Aether. Samantha Maxis sacrificed herself in the final cutscene for Black Ops Cold War Zombies in order to seal the Dark Aether breach and stop the Zombies boss called the Forsaken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957"></a><figcaption>The Terminus cutscene's mention of a Sentinel Artifact</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Terminus cutscene also tells us that Richtofen hired a French syndicate to help him find a Sentinel Artifact. This syndicate is led by Franco Moreau, and he has employed the help of Sergei Ravenov, who has abducted a man named Gabriel Krafft to interrogate for knowledge on the artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">This part of the cutscene drops some interesting names, yet it's also a little confusing. Chronologically, Sergei Ravenov was last seen helping members of the Terminus crew stop the Outbreak incursions in Black Ops Cold War. Gabriel Krafft, on the other hand, was a demonologist in Vanguard Zombies who studied these Sentinel Artifacts. He was shown as a very old man during the time of World War II, so it will be interesting to see how the story explains he is sill alive in 1991. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861441696099115196" rel="nofollow ">Treyarch even teases this</a> for the trailer reveal, referring to Krafft as "the man who should not be alive." Maybe Kraftt has resorted to using some kind of relic for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">The mystery of Kraftt's survival and the chase for a Sentinel Artifact makes Season 1 of Black Ops an exciting time to be a Zombies fan. We'll now be playing as the Terminus crew, who are headed to a castle in Europe to rescue Vanguard's Gabriel Krafft from a dangerous syndicate in order to help locate Black Ops 4's Sentinel Artifact before the powerful relic gets in the hands of Edward Richtofen. The Terminus crew not only wants to stop Richtofen, but now they're looking to use the power for themselves in order to bring Samantha Maxis back.</p><p dir="ltr">The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">cinematic trailer for Citadelle des Morts can be viewed here</a>, which shows the Terminus crew have now fled the prison island, and they've reconnected with Sergei Ravenov. They ask him to turn against the French syndicate, explaining to him that Krafft might know how to bring Samantha back.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more story and map details closer to launch. In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include Perk-a-Cola, a new field upgrade, a new ammo mod, and more Augments to unlock. The map's main story quest will also go live simultaneously with the launch.</p>

                <p>Australia has built a reputation as having one of the strictest video game rating systems on the planet, and it appears as though another highly anticipated game won't reach the country's shores when it's released next year.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, the fighting game based on the popular anime, has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), officially preventing the game from being sold in the country. The group listed no reason for the decision, but with the ACB having set a precedent with other games with similar ratings, and the reasoning behind them, it could be a few possibilities.</p><p>The main suspected reason is how drug use has a gameplay benefit, like granting speed or strength, or portraying drug use in a positive light. For example, if a character even gets health restored from narcotics, that game would likely be refused classification (RC). Disco Elysium: The Final Cut was originally banned because of this, but that decision was later overturned after the ACB agreed that player performance actually showed "negative impacts from depictions of drug use."</p><p>Other potential reasons include on-screen depictions of sexual violence and sexualized depictions of characters who appear to be under 18. South Park: The Stick of Truth was banned for the same reasons as the game involves an underaged main character getting anally probed by aliens. A censored version was released replacing those scenes with a card of a koala crying explaining what has been cut out.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact is being developed by Eighting, a close collaborator with Nintendo, having contributed to Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Pikmin 4, and Nintendo Switch Sports. The game is scheduled to be released on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC, but unless publisher Arc System Works decides to appeal, Australian fans will sadly miss out.</p>
