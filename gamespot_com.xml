                <p>If there's a common complaint about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311" data-mce-href="/games/hollow-knight-silksong/">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, it's that the game can be punishingly hard at times. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577" data-mce-href="/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/">PC Patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but the game's newest update goes even further by nerfing the damned Muckmaggots that make things so difficult in Bilewater and the Putrified Ducts.</p><p>The Muckmaggots previously ate Hornet's silk with impunity, and even binding these creatures forced players to use what little silk they had to hold them back. The update makes it easier to clear out the Muckmaggots with the Wreath of Purity, which gives Hornet a chance to heal herself by using a second bind.</p><p>Silksong's Chinese translation has also been updated with fan-made translation by Team Cart Fit. Team Cherry <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/silksong-patch-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">praised the new translation</a> by calling it "well-versed in the (quite dense) narrative and lore of both Hollow Knight games" and thanked the members of the team for letting the studio use it. The earlier Chinese translation drew criticisms from native Chinese speakers and led to the game being review-bombed.</p><p>Some of the other beneficial changes in the patch include the elimination of the same delivery in a row from couriers, as well as enabling rumble comparability with more controllers. However, the game is making Gurr the Outcast a little bit harder to fight by decreasing the time he stands unmoving.</p><p>The latest patch is currently only available for PC users, but Silksong players on consoles will get it in the near future. The complete patch notes are included below.</p><h2>Hollow Knight: Silksong Patch 4 (1.0.29242) Notes</h2><ul><li>Updated Simplified Chinese translation to use fan translation provided by Team Cart Fix.</li><li>Switched to Unity's Input System to improve overall controller support. This includes rumble features now working for various controllers, and additional controllers being recognized. Some issues may remain. For a full list of supported controllers and features, please <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.14/manual/SupportedDevices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit this site</a>.</li><li>Added additional dithering levels to advanced options. Defaults to 'low'.</li><li>Added film grain effect to advanced options. Defaults to ‘off’</li><li>Various localisation fixes implemented across all languages.</li><li>Fixed Styx not giving rosaries when delivering the Queen's Egg.</li><li>Fixed Druid's Eyes sometimes not equipping correctly when first acquired.</li><li>Fixed some down attack colliders getting stuck on in rare instances.</li><li>Fixed several instances of Hornet's plasmified state clearing when not intended (eg Bellway travel).</li><li>Fixed issues entering the plasmified state when killing a Winged Lifeseed, rather than using the Plasmium Phial.</li><li>Reduced unintentionally long bind time when using Multibinder with the Shaman crest.</li><li>Updated Multibinder's initial bind to clear maggots, per community comments.</li><li>Wreath of Purity durability increased.</li><li>Fixed void incorrectly conducting electricity.</li><li>Gurr the Outcast trap-throw attack updated from single lob to spin-style, to reduce time spent static. Other slight refinements.</li><li>Fixed Beast Crest fury slashes not piercing as intended.</li><li>Fixed Rune Rage damage scaling incorrectly.</li><li>Fixed Thread Storm damage tapering (additional hits don't taper down as sharply).</li><li>Fixed rare instances of regaining control when grabbed by a Wraith.</li><li>Fixed couriers incorrectly offering the same delivery immediately after completing it.</li><li>Fixed additional instances of Hornet being able to push some enemy types through the floor.</li><li>Fixed issues when using Harpoon to stun or kill certain bosses.</li><li>Fixed Fractured Mask not protecting against volt hazards.</li><li>Various smaller tweaks and fixes.</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11</a> is bringing huge changes to Blizzard's ARPG, among them a major departure for how the game's map and Waypoints work.</p><p dir="ltr">Since launch, players of Diablo 4 every season have had to unlock most fast-travel Waypoints at the beginning of each new season. This was because discovering Waypoints and uncovering fog of war from the map was tied to Diablo 4's zone-based Renown system, which partially reset each season.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fzBb0OsE0AY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Come Season 11, that will no longer be the case. In an interview with Diablo content creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzBb0OsE0AY" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DuQ</a>, lead live game designer Colin Finer said players who skip the campaign at the start of a new season will have all Waypoints unlocked. Skipping the campaign requires players to have completed it once before.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big change that will make the start of each new season go significantly faster, as players will no longer need to mount up and manually travel to various locations, unlocking Waypoints along the way. Instead, Waypoints will be available from the start, letting players quickly and easily travel to wherever they need to go, which should substaintially speed up the start of each season.</p><p dir="ltr">The change goes hand-in-hand with one of Diablo 4's other big Season 11 changes, as the game will be removing the current Renown system that Waypoints are tied to in favor of a new Season Rank system. Many of the most important rewards from Renown, like additional skill and Paragon points, will instead be tied to completing seasonal objectives as part of Season Rank. Altars of Lilith, another aging piece of Diablo 4 that saw players exploring the map and was tied to the Renown system, are also seeing a big change. They are being reworked to no longer grant permanent stat boosts and will instead grant experience and other minor rewards when discovered.</p><p dir="ltr">Other huge system reworks coming in Season 11 include significant changes to how Masterworking and Tempering gear works, adjustments to defense and healing, updates to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-monsters-are-getting-deadlier-and-smarter-in-season-11/1100-6535477/" data-ref-id="1100-6535477">monsters smarter and more deadly</a>, and the reintroduction of leaderboards in the form of a new challenge dungeon called The Tower.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11 is set to begin on December 9. Blizzard has not yet officially announced Diablo 4's second expansion, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">expected to arrive in 2026</a>, and just might introduce the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/evidence-of-a-diablo-4-paladin-class-may-have-just-leaked/1100-6533963/" data-ref-id="1100-6533963">Paladin class</a>.</p>

The goal for the Japanese publishing conglomerate is for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/">Elden Ring</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign, and its DLC to reach "further sales growth." To achieve this, the company said From Software has "multiple game titles in the development pipeline, both for consoles and mobile platforms."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> I Was Wrong About Elden Ring: Nightreign...</p>
      </div>
<p>"From Software is currently developing Elden Ring Nightreign DLC (planned for release in FY2025), Elden Ring Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," Kadokawa said in the report, which was released on November 6. "A mobile game for [the supernatural mystery monga] Oshi no Ko is under development (distribution is planned to begin in 2026)."</p><p>Fiscal years are broken into three-month quarters. "FY2025" normally means the end of the 2025 fiscal year, which is September 30 in the US. But because From Software and Kadokawa are Japanese companies, fiscal years are different there, with "FY2025" pointing to March 31, 2026; this is the end of the 2025 fiscal year for Japan. Not to spell it all the way out, but this suggests that Nightreign DLC should come out before March wraps. Everything is tentative, though, and until From Software announces it, take all of this with a grain of salt.</p><p>Still, this could be good news for a Nightreign community that’s been clamoring for DLC since the game's Deep of Night mode, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/">made the rougelike/souls-like way harder</a> than it already was. Despite being well received by critics and fans after its May 30 launch, Nightreign has slipped to a "mostly positive" Steam rating, with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raventg/recommended/3515610/">a handful</a> of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/katarinabluu/recommended/3515610/">recent negative reviews</a> criticizing From Software for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/CAXX/recommended/3515610/">the lack of add-on content</a> to the game.</p><p>Elden Ring's Nintendo Switch 2 port was moved out of 2025 to a nebulous 2026 window due to "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/">performance adjustments</a>," with From Software wanting to polish this version as much as possible. Meanwhile, The Duskbloods, a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-cant-create-your-own-character-in-the-duskbloods-but-you-can-customize-one/1100-6530631/" data-ref-id="1100-6530631">appears to be a slight departure</a> for the notoriously single-player-focused studio, but don't worry: From Software's Hidetaka Miyazaki said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">the team isn't abandoning what it's best known for</a>; it's just experimenting right now.</p><p>As such, the Japanese studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-unannounced-from-software-game-will-reportedly-be-coming-sooner-than-you-think/1100-6533277/" data-ref-id="1100-6533277">reportedly has a multiplatform title</a> that's so far in production it could release next year. From Software seems very busy.</p>
