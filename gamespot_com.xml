                <p>Bungie has been the center of several controversies lately, and last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">it was accused of using stolen art assets</a> in its upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. While Bungie has responded to the accusations--saying that a former artist was responsible and that it was investigating further--there have also been recent allegations that the studio's work culture has become tainted by toxic leadership.</p><p>Speaker to former IGN editor Destin Legarie--who now runs the independent games coverage channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>--former Bungie employees spoke out about the state of the studio, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly berate staff. It's also claimed that Bungie's leadership brought up the idea of adding a subscription service to Destiny, but this idea was strongly rejected by the developers.</p><p>Another example of the corporate culture at Bungie was that the studio's management allegedly expressed concerns over armor sets that could be earned in Destiny 2's PvP mode Trials of Osiris, because its design looked too good and could "impact" sales of cosmetic DLC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," one of these former employees said to Legarie, while another alleges that Bungie's current problems stem "from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p><p>Bungie has faced numerous problems over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">including mass layoffs</a> following the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion. Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, two senior executives at Bungie, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-layoffs-include-senior-execs-luke-smith-and-mark-noseworthy/1100-6525488/">were part of these layoffs</a>, and general sentiment around Marathon has been tepid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/">as its developers ask fans to give the game a chance</a>.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a>.</p>

                <p>Fortnite is currently being dominated by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-includes-force-abilities-starfighters-and-fan-favorite-characters/1100-6531254/" data-ref-id="1100-6531254">Star Wars: Galactic Battle </a>event, including an interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">Darth Vader with an AI voice</a> and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a>. But outside of Star Wars, Fortnite is introducing a new character, Iridia Vayne, and the game is giving players a chance to win her skin for free. But you'll have to move quickly to catch this giveaway.</p><p>Starting on May 23, Fortnite players are invited to put a team together for Celestial Strike Quest, a new Party Up that will be releasing new quests daily until May 31. To unlock Iridia Vayne, teams will have to complete nine quests that alternate between earning XP in creator-made experiences and experiences that were created by Epic Games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1MD74TYHRg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V1MD74TYHRg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once the complete lineup of Celestial Strike Quest has been released, players will only have until June 7 at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET to complete the event and get the Iridia Vayne skin. There are also other items that can be earned along the way, as detailed below.</p><ul><li>Complete 1 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quest: “Alien Boy” Jam Track by Oliver Tree</li><li>Complete 2 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Victory Plume Spray</li><li>Complete 3 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Slashers Pickaxe</li><li>Complete 4 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Confident Iridia Spray</li><li>Complete 5 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Peacock's Dream Wrap</li><li>Complete 6 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Scabbard Back Bling</li><li>Complete 7 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: High Five! Emoticon</li><li>Complete 8 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Origami Battalion Emote</li><li>Complete 9 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Iridia Vayne Outfit</li></ul><p>Given Fortnite's history of bringing free skins back as paid items down the line, it's likely that Iridia Vayne's skin will also become available in the Fortnite shop in the near future. If you don't mind spending money on it, you can always wait. Or you can play with a few friends and make it your mission to unlock every reward being offered in this quest.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">drew an unfair-labor-practice complaint</a> from SAG-AFTRA, the guild that represents actors in Hollywood.

                <p>DICE has published a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1925204954978861553" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing some of its thoughts about the class system for the upcoming Battlefield game, and it includes bringing back a controversial feature from Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom, and DICE is sticking with it for the next Battlefield game.</p><p>In Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, DICE said it will allow for "fully customizable weapon loadouts" that give players the "freedom to play the way [they] want."</p><p>Each class will have signature weapons, however, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 launched with "Specialist" characters as opposed to the traditional class system. People generally did not like this, and DICE brought back the four traditional classes in a later update.</p><p>The developer also confirmed that each class in Battlefield 6 will have a signature trait that provides passive bonuses; a Recon player will be able to spot enemies while aiming down sights, for example. Classes have signature gadgets, too, and they are unique to each class with the aim of giving players what they need to "fulfill the role of that class."</p><p>"We envision the future of Battlefield classes to be a series of interconnected systems and fundamentals that shape your role on the field, while granting you the freedom to customize how you execute that role," DICE said. "Through Battlefield Labs play sessions, feedback, and data gathering, we aim to strike a balance between defined roles and player choice."</p><p>While this is DICE's plan for now, the studio said it might make changes throughout the Battlefield Labs testing process. DICE encouraged people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to try the game out in a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>. As for when it may launch, it's due for release by the end of March 2026, but now that GTA 6 has been delayed, some are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">theorizing it may come out this fall.</a></p>

In a trailer revealing the collaboration, Street Fighter-style graphics and narration can be heard, and although we're not certain that this will appear if you fell a monster as Akuma, it would be a great touch for fans of the franchise.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4499207"></a><figcaption>We're hoping the trailer's Street Fighter-style narration comes with the collaboration.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4499207-monsterhunterwildsxstreetfighter6-specialcollaborationtrailer1-19screenshot.png"></figure><p>Akuma can also be seen competing in the game's arm-wrestling tournaments and traversing the environment while yelling in his recognizable aggressive tone.</p><p>Alongside the Street Fighter collaboration on May 28, Monster Hunter Wilds will also see an additional tempered monster with other gameplay adjustments as part of update 1.011.
