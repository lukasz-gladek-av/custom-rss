                <p>Tuesday was supposed to mark the arrival of the Power Rangers Megazord in Fortnite, both in the form of a battle pass skin and as an in-game event in which one player in each round of Battle Royale gets to become the full-sized Megazord and terrorize the island for a few minutes. The patch was delayed, but you'll be forgiven for not knowing that since Epic hasn't yet added any in-game notification about the delay. So the Megazord page of the battle pass just looks bugged right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972"></a><figcaption>The Megazord's arrival on the Fortnite island has been pushed back a couple days.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg"></figure><p>Epic has not acknowledged the delay, nor has it said when the patch will now be deployed, but a <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1966861908935581979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked trailer</a> for the Megazord in-game event says it begins on Thursday, September 18, so that's our best guess for now. As has been the case the past few seasons, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">battle pass owners</a> will be able to unlock the Megazord skin and all its related cosmetics by gaining 24 levels in any Fortnite mode. Despite the Megazord page of the pass already being unlocked, you cannot gain these levels early since the quests haven't yet been activated.</p><p>We don't know why it was delayed, but the patch appears to be a pretty beefy one, as it's expected to include the new <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1967953665878093948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Party Crashers battle royale mode</a>, which will have proximity voice chat and support teaming with opponents, Hunger Games-style.</p><p>Beyond that, this week marks the start of a new season of Rocket League, and so this Fortnite patch should add the Pontiac Firebird and Chevy Astro van from Rocket Pass 20, as well as a pile of other new vehicle cosmetics.</p>

                <p>A movie based on EA's The Sims is in the works, with Oscar-winner Margot Robbie's production company, LuckyChap, attached. Prolific Hollywood producer Roy Lee is involved as well, and now he's shared some further insight into what fans can expect from the video game movie.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-lego-movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, Lee said he expects the movie to be "unique." He said it's similar to The Lego Movie, in that when it was announced, people wondered how it would translate to the big screen. People didn't understand until they saw it, Lee said, and a similar thing could happen for The Sims movie.</p><p>Lee produced The Lego Movie as well, along with Robbie's blockbuster hit Barbie. "[Audiences] were probably wondering, 'What could a Barbie movie be?' Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.</p><p>There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie. Some may recall that plans were first unveiled to make a Sims movie back in 2007 at Fox, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/may/28/sim-ply-unfilmable-inside-the-sims-movie-that-never-was" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it didn't come together for a variety of reasons.</a></p><p>The Sims movie is in production for Amazon MGM Studios, with Kate Herron (Loki) attached to direct and co-write with Briony Redman (Doctor Who).
