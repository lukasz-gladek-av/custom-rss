                <p>The Xbox Avatar Editor, first introduced during the Xbox One era, will shut down on January 9, 2025, Microsoft has announced. However, Xbox 360 Avatars will stick around.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced the news via a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page</a>, stating players will no longer be able to use or access the Xbox Avatar Editor come the beginning of next year. Those who made any purchases for their avatar in the last year (since November 1, 2023), will automatically be refunded for those purchases. Those who use their avatar for their Xbox Gamerpic will continue to be able to do so, but will be unable to update it via the Xbox Avatar Editor come January 9.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the reason behind the shutdown, Microsoft said it is due to "low engagement" and the company's "shift in focus to delivering other player experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">The good news is that Xbox 360 Avatars (or Xbox Original Avatars, as they are officially called now) will still be accessible. These avatars were first introduced in 2008 for the Xbox 360 before being carried forward to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S and are actually used for some Xbox 360 games--mostly Xbox Live Arcade titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/1-vs-100-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-38067">1 vs.100</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-kingdom-for-keflings/" data-ref-id="5000-35399">A Kingdom for Keflings</a>, or the marketing-stunt-turned-video-game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doritos-crash-course/" data-ref-id="5000-91756">Doritos Crash Course</a>. They can also still be used as Gamerpics and customized via the Xbox Original Avatars app on consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Xbox 360 Avatars found some popularity due to their Nintendo Mii-like appearance, the modern iteration of avatars added for Xbox One never seemed to find its footing, and has long been an afterthought. Microsoft emphasized on its support page that despite Xbox Avatars getting the axe, players can still personalize and customize their Xbox experience in other ways, like with dynamic backgrounds, custom Gamerpics, and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> is a good time to stock up on some new hardware, and if you've been looking to grab a new PC monitor, you can get an <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5481444012%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer Nitro 27-inch display at Walmart</a> for $109. That's a very decent price for a monitor that would be ideal for a workhorse device, so if you've been looking to create a multi-monitor setup at home that won't cost an arm and a leg, this is an affordable option. The catch here is that the deal will be open first to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart+ subscribers</a> starting 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on November 25, and if it doesn't sell out, the special will be available to the general public starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg"></figure><p>Given that this monitor typically sells for around $160, we're not expecting the stock to be around for long, as Walmart offered something similar last year and it sold out very quickly.

There's also a free-trial-period option available if you just want to hop in for a quick bargain, but the overall membership is pretty good. It gets you exclusive early access to deals like this, free shipping, a Paramount+ subscription, and several more perks that make it worthwhile.</p><p>For this curved monitor, you're getting a good all-rounder at this price. It has a 180Hz refresh rate, up to 250 Nits of brightness, and a 1080p resolution. This makes it ideal for run-of-the-mill work, or if you're looking to set up a PC gaming space for a younger family member, it's a solid monitor to play games like Fortnite or Valorant on.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get some big discounts on high-end ultrawide monitors for Black Friday. You won't need a multi-monitor setup with one of these, as they're big enough to easily display web browsers and apps simultaneously, and one of the standout deals here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP6HW894?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G9</a> 49-inch monitor.

                <p>The modding community for Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive one, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/"> with Larian officially embracing mods</a>, the game has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/"> more players than ever</a>. However, how many mods for a single game is too many? Larian was looking through stats, and apparently, players with 100+ mods aren't that uncommon, but this poses a bit of a problem for gameplay, so the studio is putting its foot down for console players.</p><p>Larian announced that it is issuing a 100-mod limit to console players for the sake of gameplay to avoid any other possible disasters. In the statement, the studio broke down why it imposed the limit and what to do if you already have exceeded the limit.</p><p>"Unlike PC, consoles can only juggle so many files at once. The more mods you have installed, the quicker this file limit is reached. Now that some of you have been trying to play with more than 100 mods, you've been letting us know that you're experiencing slow loading times or even game crashes," the <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-29-now-live-console-only_127" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement read</a>. "While we recommend only installing the mods you know you'll definitely continue playing with, to [maximize] stability, we’re introducing a 100-mod limit for console platforms. This change comes in today's console-only hotfix that introduces the limit, and depending on how many mods you already have installed, you may see different messaging when you next load your game."</p><p>The statement continued explaining if you have more than 100 mods, you won't be able to play on a console for the time being, but cross-saves on PC and console should be fine. The statement warns players may have to disable a number of mods from their PC so they can access the cross-save. However, another update is coming to give players access to those saves.</p><p>"We'll be shipping another fix soon that will aim to give you the means to access console saves that are disabled after today's update," Larian continued. "However, it is important to note that mods can cause general instability, particularly on console, and depending on the mods you've had enabled on a save, you may run into issues when certain mods are disabled."</p>

Actress Jen Taylor has had the same longevity as Master Chief's AI companion, Cortana. However, according to Downes, he and Taylor were briefly replaced by other performers during the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-6399288/" data-ref-id="1900-6399288">Halo 4</a>.</p><p>Downes recently shared the story of his recasting on his YouTube channel. As the actor recalls, neither he nor Taylor were aware that 343 Industries--which took over the Halo franchise from Bungie--had already cast new performers for Master Chief and Cortana. According to Downes, testers complained about not feeling connected to the new voices for those iconic characters. But before Downes could return, he had to audition for the role he made famous.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuEJMOAzNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NfuEJMOAzNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Downes and Taylor have remained firmly in place ever since, and the latter even reprised her role as Cortana on the Halo TV series on Paramount+. In response to Downes' story, Generalkidd reposted a clip from a Halo 4 build that features noticeably different voices for Master Chief and Cortana. However, Generalkidd points out that this may have been a temp track and unrelated to Downes' account about the actors who were chosen to replace them.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Generalkidd/status/1860878001769939137" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I guess this has become a hot topic again. For those who are curious, in the Oct 11 2011 build of Halo 4, alternate voice actors for Chief and Cortana can be heard.
