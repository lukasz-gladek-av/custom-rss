                <p dir="ltr">A new event is coming to Destiny 2 as part of the final arc of Episode Heresy: Rite of the Nine. This limited-time event will bring with it tons of new challenges, the return of some fan-favorite loot, and even a new social space. Here are all the details you need to know about Rite of the Nine and how it will work.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</a></li><li><a href="#What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</a></li><li><a href="#Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</a><ul><li><a href="#Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_does_Rite_of_the_Nine_come_out_">When does Rite of the Nine come out?</h2><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine doesn't have an exact release date as of yet, but it will be launching <strong>sometime after the start of Episode Heresy Act III</strong>, which is now live, having launched on April 1, 2025. This will be a limited-time event that likely will last until the launch of the new expansion of Destiny 2, currently only known as "Project Apollo" from Bungie's 2025-2026 roadmap. But the specific end date is unconfirmed.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite these three featured dungeons previously requiring a Dungeon Key from their respective expansions, <strong>Rite of the Nine will be free for all players</strong>. That means anyone with a base copy of Destiny 2 can play the event while it is live.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_Rite_of_the_Nine_event_in_Destiny_2_">What is the Rite of the Nine event in Destiny 2?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4468999"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4468999-rotn-spire.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will be focused solely on dungeons in a similar vein to the Pantheon challenges from Into the Light. Three dungeons will be featured on rotation: <strong>Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher,</strong> and <strong>Ghosts of the Deep</strong>. The Rite of the Nine event adds a slew of new difficulty modes, updated loot, and a revamped farming system to earn loot on repeated runs.</p><p dir="ltr">Players will also have access to a new social space called <strong>The Third Spire</strong>, which is a revised version of the old victory space from Trials of the Nine when players completed a Flawless run. Here, players can visit an old ally, the <strong>Emissary of the Nine</strong>, for access to all the new rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Each week, one dungeon will be listed as the featured dungeon and players will engage in various challenges in that one dungeon. There will be three difficulty options available, allowing players of all skill levels to earn something. For players willing to take on the highest difficulty, special loot is up for grabs.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will feature 12 revised weapons from past encounters with an all-new selection of perks. Adept versions will be available earned if dungeons are completed on the highest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">A new Origin trait called <strong>Gravity Well</strong> will be exclusive to these weapons. Along with the initial Origin perk in the fifth column, Gravity Well will also be able to be chosen as an option. Gravity Well's effects are listed as "Reloading this weapon automatically gathers nearby ammo." It's not known exactly how far away this takes effect, but the perk seems to gather any nearby ammo bricks on the ground, Heavy or Special, and pull them to your character on a reload.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also visit the Emissary of the Nine in the Third Spire space to attune their loot drops from dungeon completions. Similar to how the Brave Arsenal worked in Into the Light, only one attunement can be active per run, and this will increase the likelihood of obtaining that weapon as a reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Players who finish a dungeon on the highest difficulty,<strong> Ultimatum</strong>, will be able to earn an Adept weapon. These weapons have a unique shader effect on them making them glow and shimmer. Adept versions of weapons will also have boosted stats over the normal versions, so they will have an upper hand over normal drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the 12 weapons coming with Rite of the Nine:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prosecutor</strong> Auto Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Relentless</strong> Pulse Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Judgment</strong> Hand Cannon</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>A Sudden Death</strong> Shotgun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wilderflight</strong> Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Long Arm</strong> Scout Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Liminal Vigil</strong> Sidearm</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Terminus Horizon</strong> Machine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>New Pacific Epitaph</strong> Breach-loaded Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Survivors</strong> Submachine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greasy Luck</strong> Glaive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cold Comfort</strong> Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Other rewards from Rite of the Nine also include <strong>five new Emblems</strong>, <strong>a new Title/Seal</strong>, and <strong>weapon ornaments.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine's rotating dungeons are broken up into three difficulty tiers, allowing players of any skill level to earn something and experience a challenge. Each mode changes aspects of the dungeon, such as displaying helpful tips to the rather difficult "Notswap" modifier. Here's how each one is broken down.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This mode is essentially "Beginner Mode" with an incredibly forgiving difficulty level and much less harsh punishments for wipes and party deaths. While we don't know the maximum Power level for these dungeons yet, we can assume it will be a low bar to clear. The rules for Explorer Mode are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Darkness Zones.</strong> Normally when players come across a Darkness Zone, if the full time dies with no revives available, the encounter resets back to the start of the last checkpoint. In Explorer Mode, Darkness Zones are completely disabled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Revive timer is only five seconds.</strong> Revive Timers in dungeons typically range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds. In Explorer Mode, they are much more forgiving so players can be revived more quickly.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Tooltips explain mechanics.</strong> Before beginning the encounter, tooltips will be visible that explain how each encounter basically functions. New players will be able to immediately pick up on these tips and execute their mechanics.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Waypoints guide players</strong> during more open sections of dungeons. These will constantly be visible to guide players to the next objective.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Helper platforms</strong> appear when a player reaches a checkpoint, helping those who struggle with jumping puzzles.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">Bungie has not shared the full details on how this mode will work, but it is likely more geared towards casual players seeking a challenge. It's possible most of the standard rules for dungeons will be present here such as Darkness Zones, longer revive timers, and possibly even more strict timers on certain encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be a scoring mechanic live in Eternity Mode that will gauge players' performance based on time spent on an encounter, enemies killed, and revives remaining after an encounter is completed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the highest difficulty level for Rite of the Nine. Basically this is only where the best of the best can thrive. It's likely this will have a lower power cap and feature lots of extra modifiers to make the encounters much more unforgiving and difficult to navigate. The rules that we know of so far are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contest Mode difficulty.</strong> Much like when a raid is live for the first time, players will be at least 20 levels below the Power level of all enemies in the dungeons. Enemies will also be much more aggressive, shooting more often and running towards players whenever possible. Limited revives will prevent players from completing encounters if they run out.</li><li dir="ltr">"<strong>Notswap" Modifier.</strong> Notswap is a new modifier where, if a player swaps an Exotic armor, a weapon, or a class, all of their energy is drained to zero. All cooldowns will be reactivated, the Super gauge will be set to zero, and they will have to regain all energy to use abilities again.</li></ul><p>Scoring will be based on deaths.The fewer deaths accumulated through an entire run, the higher the score will be. If players achieve a <strong>Platinum</strong> score, they will receive an <strong>Adept</strong> weapon at the end.</p>

                <p>Developer Rebellion is perhaps best known for the Sniper Elite series, but the UK's studio latest release, Atomfall, is now the developer's "most successful launch" in its 32-year history. </p><p>Atomfall launched in full on March 27 and reached 1 million players over its first weekend, climbing further to more than 1.5 million so far. The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident </a>in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>"To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion," the developer's CEO and co-founder, Jason Kingsley, said in a statement. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</p><p>Rebellion also shared some other stats from launch, including:</p><ul><li>316,000 players killed the scientist at the start of the game</li><li>Players have used the cricket bat 3.7 million times to rack up kills.</li><li>More than 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</li></ul><p>Atomfall no doubt benefitted in terms of player numbers by launching into the Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass game catalogs. Rebellion did not, however, say how many copies of Atomfall have been sold across all platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.</p><p>In fact, there is no indiciation at all as to how Rebellion is measuring success for Atomfall. Also unknown is how much Atomfall cost to develop or market. As always, game development budgets remain mysterious. What we do know is Atomfall is not Rebellion's first Game Pass day-one release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance was a Game Pass launch as well.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p>

A new trailer highlights the newest Nightfarer's (Nightreign's version of classes) impressive mobility, showing the ability to send out a scatter of arrows while sliding or even firing shots after double-jumping off a wall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQ4uE_TPdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Iron Eye has some heavy-hitting abilities as well, such as a move that pulls out a massive bow and arrow that can pierce enemies and is followed up by a shockwave that knocks down surrounding foes. The Ironeye joins other Nightfarers like the magic-specializing Recluse, the grapple-shot-wielding Wylder, the nimble assassin-like Duchess, and the tank-oriented Guardian for a total of five playable classes revealed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring Nightreign so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players got to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-included-over-30-billion-lost-runes/1100-6530467/" data-ref-id="1100-6530467">Elden Ring Nightreign in February as part of a network test</a>, only for it to be plagued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">server issues that From Software later apologized for</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>, Tamoor Hussain said that the battle royale-inspired nature of Nightreign at first seems like From Software is chasing multiplayer trends but in reality aligns with many of the design principles the studio is known for, calling it "very much a From Software game."
