                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2's launch this week</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reflected on the first Switch console in a new video. As Huang explained, Nintendo had an ambitious goal to create a gaming device that was "powerful enough" to run first-party games at home and still be small enough to be used while on the go.</p><p>"We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade, drawn together by a shared belief that technology should serve creativity, and that joy is worth engineering for," Huang said in a Nintendo Creator's Voice video, while also reflecting on late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's vision for the system.</p><p>"I still remember the day Iwata shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day."</p><p>According to Huang, the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip for the Switch took over "500 engineer years" to develop, and the company had to "reinvent everything" for the Switch 2. Huang added that it achieved three major breakthroughs on the Switch 2: full-hardware ray tracing, dedicated AI processors, and "ultra low power" through optimized semiconductor process technology for high performance. The Nvidia CEO claims that this has led to the most advanced graphics ever seen in a portable device.</p><p>The Switch 2 represents a major step forward for Nintendo in terms of graphics, as the hybrid console is capable of rendering games at up to 4K resolution and 60fps when docked. This means that some good-looking games will be coming to the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">like Cyberpunk 2077</a>. CD Projekt Red recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-cyberpunk-2077-to-run-on-switch-2-wasnt-as-challenging-as-cd-projekt-red-thought/1100-6531992/">bringing the game to Switch 2 wasn't actually as much of a challenge</a> as anticipated, as modern technologies like Nvidia's DLSS helped make the port easier.</p><p>While other graphically impressive third-party games like Elden Ring and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/" data-ref-id="1100-6531363">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> are headed to Switch 2, several first-party Nintendo titles will also be upgraded on the system. These include paid-for upgrades in titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>, while smaller <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-switch-2-footage-shows-the-game-looking-much-smoother-in-action/1100-6531995/" data-ref-id="1100-6531995">free updates for games like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> will also be available.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red has unveiled some truly gorgeous new footage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4</a> running on PS5. But it's important to note that even though this looked like a gameplay video, the studio specifically noted this was a "technical showcase" for the RPG.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">The Witcher 4 was featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a> in Orlando earlier today, with CD Projekt Red previewing the game on PS5--not PS5 Pro, to be clear. That distinction is necessary since the developer stated the footage was running at 60fps on the Sony console with ray tracing. The tech demo for The Witcher 4 starts with Ciri standing on a cliff, peering out at snow-capped mountains and forested valleys.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AjikvaR0i34?si=curvr5-uR8nON2Zc&amp;start=2028" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">From there, The Witcher 4 protagonist walks along a path before meeting up with her buddy, Kelpie. She saddles the horse and takes off at a gallop. CD Projekt Red uses this moment to demonstrate the black mare's muscle movement and fluidity with Unreal Engine 5. The developer transitions from this fauna to highlight <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine" rel="nofollow ">nanite foliage</a> in the open-world game.</p><p dir="ltr">Meeting back up with Ciri (and Kelpie), The Witcher 4 tech demo introduces the port town of Valdrest. After jumping off her horse, Ciri takes down her hood to walk around the market. CD Projekt Red is proud of how when she bumps into a person carrying a crate of apples, the fallen fruit leads to a boy and pigs running toward the food organically.</p><p dir="ltr">While this footage of The Witcher 4 might bring back bad memories of Cyberpunk 2077 promises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/">CD Projekt Red has previously mentioned it's learned from its past mistakes</a>. Another key difference is The Witcher 4 is made in Unreal Engine 5; Cyberpunk 2077 utilized the studio's internal RED Engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/">The Witcher 4 isn't arriving anytime soon</a>. CD Projekt Red has noted it won't launch until after 2026, but that's all for specifics regarding a release window. And yes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-was-always-planned-to-have-ciri-as-the-new-lead/1100-6531815/">Ciri was always planned to be the lead</a> in this new RPG.

                <p>While the large publishers continue pumping out sequels and remakes, Nippon Ichi Software’s new CEO Kenzo Saruhashi says mid-sized companies should be taking more risks if they're to survive.</p><p>In a Famitsu interview translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/if-we-dont-make-new-ips-well-die-nippon-ichi-software-believes-mid-size-developers-need-to-do-what-the-big-guns-cant/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Saruhashi and Yomawari series creator Yu Mizokami discussed the company's policy when it comes to making new IPs in the face of rising development costs and risk of failure. This followed the publisher's March 2025 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1LAuAa5zog" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Untitled"</a> stream, where it revealed six new titles, of which five were brand-new IP.</p>

<p>Saruhashi notes that although making sequels is the easier and safer option, NIS does things differently. "In our case, we’re more driven by whether our fans want a sequel. If there’s demand for it, we’ll make it.”</p><p>In regards to making new IP, he said that it's imperative for a mid-sized company to dare to do things big companies can't risk in order to survive. He added, "If we were to stop taking on new challenges, we would be like a fish out of water--I think we’d die.”</p><p>These new and experimental titles are however being given limited budgets, which means developers need to come up with creative solutions. But in the interview, Mizokami commented that she prefers the thrill of problem-solving within a tight budget, saying that she'd "probably get bored halfway through" if suddenly given a multi-million budget. Saruhashi and Mizokami instead liken NIS's approach to "speedrun/real-time attack-style game development.”</p><p>NIS nonetheless still has some notable franchises it continues to release, including the Disgaea series, while its Western counterpart NIS America publishes the international release of the Trails series.</p>

                <p>Besides the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">$80 price point</a>, one of the biggest talking points about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> has been the Cow. Producer Kosuke Yabuki has now reacted to the excitement about the Cow, and re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">the Cow does in fact eat burgers</a>, but they may not be real-beef burgers.</p><p>"The decision to include Cow was something that we considered in terms of if we added that, I think people would be really happy about it. And so we did," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yabuki told IGN</a>. "But honestly, the reaction to that by the public was much bigger than we possibly could have anticipated. So that was a wonderful surprise."</p><p>As discussed previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">a "silly sketch" led to the creation of the Cow</a>, who has become one of the game's most popular characters in the lead up to release.</p><p>Yabuki went on to say that the Cow "really opened the floodgates" for Nintendo because it inspired the developers to wonder, "'Well, maybe we should just add who we can.'" Thinking this way, the developers also chose to add the Penguin and Pokey.</p><p>"Because all of these characters came in such a rush as the designers were getting kind of carried away, it's actually a little hard for me to remember which specific character would've come immediately next in the sequence after Cow," Yabuki said. "Because honestly, I have this memory of approving the concept for Cow, and then maybe the next day I had 10 proposals for other characters on my desk."</p><p>Given that Mario Kart World has a new mechanic that lets players stop at roadside restaurants and grab a bite to eat, many have been wondering if the Cow can stop for a burger or steak. The creature can, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily eating its own kind. Asked if the Cow specifically consumers beef or veggie burgers, Kabuki said, "Sorry that's top secret. I can't say."</p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.
