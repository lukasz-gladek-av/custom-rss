                <p dir="ltr"><em>God of War is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 22, 2025. Below, we examine how Kratos' character arc has shifted over time to become a timely reflection on masculinity and change.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As much as people remember the brutality and the grandiosity of God of War, as a singular game and as a series, it's easy to forget that the first God of War in 2005 doesn't actually begin with Kratos fighting a hydra and ripping soldiers apart with his bare hands.</p><p dir="ltr">It begins with a suicide attempt. Starting a new game, the very first thing we hear from Kratos is him gravely intoning that "the gods have abandoned me" before walking straight off a cliff into the Aegean Sea. This is a warlord who accidentally murdered his own wife and child, and is then cursed by an oracle to have his family's ashes permanently grafted to his skin, ensuring there is nowhere in Greece he can go where his crimes are unrecognized. The only help he receives is being conscripted by the gods to murder Ares, who set him up to begin with, which isn't really helpful at all. The reward is the gods' forgiveness, which does nothing to alleviate his consistent nightmares about the deed. When blood doesn't grant him peace, the gods give him power, letting him take Ares' place as the Greek God of War, beginning a reign so destructive that almighty Zeus himself has to intervene to take him down. That's before finding out Zeus himself is Kratos' father, and Kratos having his revenge means laying waste to his entire domain. Which Kratos does.</p><p dir="ltr">For a series that built so much of its early reputation on violent catharsis, it always felt ike Sony having their cake and eating it too that Kratos' quests never really get him any real solutions to his pain. Even when he sacrifices himself for a more noble cause in God of War III, spilling blood doesn't fix problems in this series--though it sure feels great in the moment. It all still leads to the desolation of Kratos' homeland, the complete massacre of its pantheon, and he himself doomed to wander the Earth with nothing but his thoughts. If I had a nickel for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilerfree-review/1900-6417483/">every prestige PlayStation franchise that ended up there</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbj5C-Sw2_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lbj5C-Sw2_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">All of this is a product of the time in which Kratos was born, really. Not as a character, but as a game from 2005, and one that felt like a grim-and-gritty nu-metal take on Greek myth--and two years before Zack Snyder would get there on film, to boot. Kratos' angst is the style of the time, a man who has made horrible, cruel, vicious mistakes, and his rage about that becomes everyone's problem. Everything about Kratos' design is of its place and time, and if there is any enduring lesson from that place and time, it's that hatred and violence can be useful and have their place, but they, in and of themselves, are not solutions. There is no happy ending with just nihilism as a driving force. By definition, it ends with nothing. God of War III just shows us the endpoint. Or, at least, what we thought was the end, before 2018, and Kratos' arc became one of the most beautiful things ever committed to pixels.</p><p dir="ltr">What tends to go forgotten after all these years is that the shift for this character didn't begin in 2018. It began in 2010, when we find out exactly why Zeus felt Kratos needed to die, the first acknowledgement that he himself had started a cycle of violence, creating the precise circumstances where his child, Kratos, would do to him what Zeus did to Kronos. But, again, Zeus still dies in God of War III. One of the unkillable plagues of AAA gaming is the inability for its stories to speak a language that isn't a language of blood, and there was no way to reconcile Kratos with the forces that resulted in his existence except by ensuring Zeus could not inflict more pain on others--not that there was anyone left on Olympus when Kratos was done. The cycle could only have a chance to be broken by taking Greece's #1 abuser out of the equation.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing we never see much of--in real life or in video games--is what awaits on the other side. Revenge is easy to obtain, retribution is easy to imagine, but the thing we don't consider enough in our art is what rehabilitation looks like. What does it mean for someone having done the things Kratos has done to continue to exist, if we are to allow him to exist?</p><p dir="ltr">There's no roadmap for processing the things Kratos has done, the only certainty being that he must carry the unrelenting weight of it. And he does carry it. The Kratos of 2018 is, too, a product of his time. He is heavy, taciturn, all too aware of what his power and anger can bring, trapped alive in a tomb of scars and regrets. It's where the manhood he was created to embody leads. But the singular issue with men knowing their acts have consequences, the innate wrongness of it all, is there is so little that tells them where to go next. That's especially true for Kratos since the one woman who could have guided him a little further down a righteous path has passed away when the new games begin.</p><p dir="ltr">The only light that shines out in that darkness is the fact that Kratos has a son. And in his son, even as he lacks the literal and metaphorical vocabulary to do it, he has but one true north, a realignment of priorities for this kind of narrative: "Don't be sorry. Be better."</p><p dir="ltr">How does Kratos atone? Are the centuries Kratos spends in silent exile enough? Is it enough that he once again loses a wife? The hard answer is that there may never be enough. But the asterisk is that it is good and worthwhile to try.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus begins a story unlike any in all of gaming and at bare minimum rare in all of fiction; the slayer of gods, monsters and men putting something back into the world instead of burning it all down, a father seeing his future reflected in the prism of his child's life, while ever pursued by the distorted Norse funhouse mirror of his past. And even though Kratos takes up the blades again, it is endlessly fascinating that Kratos does not regress. There is brutality still, a wellspring to draw upon when faced with a threat. But the timbre of the violence is different. It is violence attempting to operate without malice. And that's a hard tightrope to walk, one that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok don't always traverse without slipping. But the intent is clear, on the part of the developers, and this character, this man. We must try to be better, even when better is inconvenient.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos watching himself and his son struggle with power and privilege is wonderful on its own, their journey towards empathy and sympathy for each other, for all they have endured is equally so. But the moment that fully raised Kratos into the rarified air of characters in gaming came later, when the Valhalla DLC for God of War Ragnarok dropped, and Kratos faced his true enemy. Himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos faces his younger self, the bastard who slaughtered by the thousands, bathed in blood and fury, the one who would rather have killed himself than confront his grief and crimes, and the one who came to power he did not deserve or understand. That Kratos. It could have been a final boss. Instead, it is a monologue. Kratos has the vocabulary to face himself.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL9c_A9I2VY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qL9c_A9I2VY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">High-profile games don't reckon with the ramifications of their existence much. It's not fun, or entertaining, or empowering in the traditional sense. And a power trip like 2005's God of War is those three things above all else. But no matter what the medium is, there's a crucial honesty in the idea that the stories we tell each other grow with us, that a tale can mean one thing when you're 20, and something else entirely when you're 40. Where God of War differs is in being one of the few video game characters that has legitimately grown and changed in 20 years. Not after a reboot or redesign, but because the character has had experiences that recontextualize everything he's done. And so, Kratos faces himself.</p><p dir="ltr">"What can I say to you? I remember how it felt to take the throne. All that it meant, and all that it did not. A god of war. A god of pain. Of suffering. Of destruction. The Norns said I chase a redemption that I know I can never deserve. What does that make me? God of fools. A god of...hope. ‘When all else is lost.' You lost everything. And everyone. And you became. There is no forgiving you. You chose. I chose! What now? Should I, this same man…should I sit? Take? Proclaim? Lead? Place myself in service? In service. Should I lose everything and everyone? Will there still be enough left inside so that I do not become you? I do not know. But I have hope. You are cruel, and arrogant, and selfish. But you are more than that. You have always been more than what others saw. You are more than that."</p><p dir="ltr">That monologue represents one of the greatest feats of storytelling in this medium, putting itself in direct dialogue with the game that many of us followed into adulthood, with many of them really. It is a thorough understanding of the power of escapism, the appeal of it, but also its limits, its failures, and ultimately, that it is not enough for any soul that wishes to evolve. For men in particular, the ones for whom Kratos represented a place of violent force unquestioned, for those words to come from a better man is miraculous. And it uses one of gaming's most violent monsters to tell it, without redeeming him, simply showing the path forward, the way to wield power and privilege. There is no arc like this in the wider landscape of gaming. And that, more than any blessing from the gods, will make Kratos truly immortal.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--<strong>Season 3 starts on March 25</strong>, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.</p><p dir="ltr">With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_teaser">Fortnite OG Season 3 teaser</h2><p>Epic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHdzbgTMbcX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser</a> are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Pass_Season_3">Fortnite OG Pass Season 3</h2><p>The first two OG passes have included three new skins that are remixes of existing skins that first appeared during the original seasons. Each pass had two remixes of old pass skins and one remix of a shop skin, though it should be noted that they had to do it that way for those seasons because they didn't have many skins--the Season 1 shop only had two, and the Season 2 battle pass only had three knights and Sparkle Specialist.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354" data-ratio="0.55826771653543" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354"></a><figcaption>The original Season 3 pass, pictured here, will heavily inspire the OG Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 3 battle pass, by contrast, had six skins--Rust Lord, Elite Agent, The Reaper (Fortnite-brand John Wick), and three astronauts. They could make three distinct skins from that group, but on the shop side of things, Season 3 did introduce Raven--and Epic loves doing new versions of Raven almost as much as it likes doing new versions of Midas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_map">Fortnite OG Season 3 map</h2><p dir="ltr">Not much changed between Season 2 and 3, as you can see--the Season 3 map is almost identical to the Season 2 island that's on the way out. But that teaser including the meteor could be hinting that we'll start in the middle. As the end of the season approached, and the meteor came along with it, small pieces of the meteor kept falling off and damaging the island every match, and that's exactly the sort of shakeup feature that the OG mode could use. Since Epic has typically not done many in-season map changes in the OG mode, would anybody be upset if they jumped straight to that part?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352" data-ratio="1" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG's presumed Season 3 map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_loot_pool">Fortnite OG Season 3 loot pool</h2><p dir="ltr">Most of the current OG loot pool will stick around for Season 3, but this season introduced a variety of interesting new weapons and gadgets that you will very likely see in the new OG season.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hand cannon</li><li dir="ltr">Crossbow</li><li dir="ltr">Guided missile</li><li dir="ltr">Egg launcher</li><li dir="ltr">Port-a-fort</li><li dir="ltr">Remote explosives</li><li dir="ltr">Clingers</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a>, the first real attempt ever to compete with The Sims in the life sim space, is here, releasing via Steam Early Access, and it's only natural that players will spend their first several hours in the game creating their characters and messing around in build mode to see what kinds of dollhouses they can assemble. There's no point in jumping into the simulation until you've got everything else in order.</p><p>For those Sims players who are eager to see what InZoi's got that The Sims doesn't, be warned that InZoi's build mode has a few big quirks that you'll need to learn about before you get started, or else you might accidentally rip the walls out of your house while you're trying to make it bigger. Fortunately, we've got you covered with our InZoi build mode guide.</p><h2>How InZoi's home-building gameplay differs from the Sims</h2><p>If you're coming to InZoi from The Sims 4, you'll probably be used to a build mode in which everything is one context-sensitive click away. Clicking on an object picks it up; clicking on a wall lets you move it to expand or contract the room it's containing. You just click on what you want to manipulate, and then you manipulate it. InZoi's build mode is slightly more complicated than that, thanks largely to the fact that it has more customization options--but there are some fundamental differences from The Sims that will probably trip you up at first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269"></a><figcaption>InZoi's build mode will be familiar to Sims fans, but it has several unique aspects to it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><span>The first of these big differences is that you need to choose the right selection mode. By default, your cursor is using the standard "</span><strong>Selection Tool</strong><span>," which lets you click on and manipulate individual objects, like your couch. When you're in the mode, moving a wall will move </span><em>only</em><span> the wall--the room the wall belonged to won't change aside from no longer having a wall. If you want to change the size of a room, or make your house bigger, you'll instead need to choose the </span><strong>Room Selection Tool</strong><span>, which you can find on the build mode options bar near the top of the UI, immediately to the right of the standard Selection Tool.</span></h3><p dir="ltr">It's in that part of Build Mode--the part where you're dealing with furniture, appliances, and anything else you might put in your house--where you'll find another quirk you'll need to remember. In InZoi, you can customize your furniture just as deeply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-custom-clothes-and-furniture-in-inzoi/1100-6530233/" data-ref-id="1100-6530233">you can customize your clothing</a>, but you can only do so <em>after</em> you have placed the item in question. So you would, say, pick a couch you like from the build menu, place it in your home, and click on it to bring up the option to customize it--then you'll be presented with a pile of options for texture and color, and you can upload your own texture images yourself if you want, or use InZoi's built-in AI image generator to make one. If you want all your furniture to be covered in pictures of your dog, you can do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268"></a><figcaption>You'd better get used to swapping between the Selection Tool and the Room Selection Tool, because you're going to do it a lot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This after-the-fact customization causes no issues for things like your refrigerator, but since everything you can place in build mode works the same way, there are certain things where this becomes a problem. For example, if you want to add a staircase that turns 180 degrees halfway up, you'll have to place a full straight flight of stairs first and then bend it afterward. Since the purpose of such a staircase is to save on the horizontal space that the staircase takes up, having it work this way defeats that purpose because you have to make room for the full normal staircase anyway. You'll have to exercise a bit of cleverness to deal with this issue when it arises.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you understand these two basic aspects, most builders will be ready to go in InZoi; build mode is otherwise largely similar to that of The Sims but with a redesigned UI. But we'd be remiss if we forgot to point out one other strange thing about InZoi's build mode that has no equivalent in The Sims.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270"></a><figcaption>The ersatz apartment building where my Zois live</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I set up my first Zoi family, I put them in what looks like the first floor of a small apartment building in Dowon, which you can see above--it has a communal space with a gym on the ground floor, with three floors of living space above it. My family lived on the first of those floors, but I soon realized that I had no neighbors, and there was no access point for the upper two floors.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole building belonged to my family, and I just had to build new staircases to get up there--I had three times more space to work with than I'd thought, and my small apartment turned into a large house in minutes. It was a pretty surprising development since this is not how a building like this works in real life, and the game had made no attempt to tell me that I could do that. This is something to keep in mind when you start feeling like your family needs more space--you might already have it.</p><p dir="ltr">InZoi launches in Early Access on Steam on March 27 for $40.
