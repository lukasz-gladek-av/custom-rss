                <p>The story of Max Caulfield and her best friend, Chloe Price, was a major part of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-686438">Life is Strange</a>, and the pair are apparently about to reunite. The Pan-European Game Information has seemingly leaked the next game in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion, which looks to bring Max and Chloe back together for the first time in years.</p><p>In the original game, Max used her powers to rewind time to save Chloe's life, only to face a choice between saving her friend or saving their hometown. Chloe wasn't a featured character in the most recent game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure/" data-ref-id="5000-631969">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, but the PEGI rating for Reunion reveals that both of the game's heroines are facing some serious trials ahead.</p><p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time," reads the game's description. "Losing her is Max's greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus."</p><p>The PEGI rating notes that most of the violence in the game is implied, and that there are some swear words. It also specifically notes a scene where the player's character has the option of accepting wine to drink before realizing that it was spiked with a hallucinogen.</p><p>Square Enix will release Life is Strange: Reunion on PS5 according to the rating, which doesn't mention PC or Xbox Series X|S. Presumably an official announcement of the game will be made soon.</p><p>Late last year, Prime Video ordered a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-tv-series-officially-happening-after-9-years/1100-6534515/" data-ref-id="1100-6534515">Life is Strange TV series</a>. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/life-is-strange-creators-not-involved-in-tv-series-writer-says/1100-6534543/" data-ref-id="1100-6534543">the original creators of the game are apparently not involved</a> in the show.</p>
