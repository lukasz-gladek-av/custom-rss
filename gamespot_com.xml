                <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is a unique game that combines the best aspects of the first two titles in the series to create something entirely new. It met with positive reviews when it first launched on PC and mobile in 2016, and now it’s gearing up for a physical release on Switch that is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder</a> ahead of its April 24 release. Preordering at Amazon locks in its price guarantee, so if the game is discounted ahead of launch, you’ll pay the lower price. You also won’t be charged until the game is shipped.</p><h2>Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>There are currently no preorder bonuses for RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic. It’s unlikely that’ll change in the coming weeks, though if anything is announced, we’ll update this section with details.</p><div title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3152" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Physical Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases April 24</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is essentially the best parts of RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Just like those games, you'll build, customize, and manage your own theme park. Along with the option to simply build and manage your park in a free-form effort, there’s a structured Park Scenarios system that tasks you with completing 95 challenges from the first two games. This version of the game includes the Toolkit, Wacky Worlds, and Time Twister expansion packs. Physical editions are available to preorder at most retailers. The game is also available now digitally.</p>                      </div><p>This isn’t the first RollerCoaster Tycoon game on Switch, as you’ll also find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RollerCoaster-Tycoon-Adventures-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C9R5S1F7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures: Deluxe Edition</a> for $30.

Almost all the major Capcom series are here, though don't expect many new titles. The picks mostly include HD remasters and collections of classic entries in series like Ace Attorney, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more. One of the only major omissions is the Monster Hunter series--likely because Fanatical recently ran a separate Monster Hunter Bundle that is unfortunately no longer available.</p><p dir="ltr">The pricing structure is like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, with the price per key dropping as you add more games to your bundle. The savings aren't as high as most Fanatical bundle deals, but you're still getting big discounts on most titles. The deal starts at $13 for two games ($6.50 per key), three games for 19 ($6.33 per key), and four games for $25 ($6.25 per key). There's no limit to how many games you can add, meaning you can grab all 21 games for $131.25 if you want. </p><ul><li dir="ltr">Capcom Beat 'em Up Bundle</li><li dir="ltr">Dead Rising 4 - Frank's Big Package</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 5 + Vergil</li><li dir="ltr">DmC: Devil May Cry</li><li dir="ltr">Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</li><li dir="ltr">The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite - Definitive Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man 11</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Onimusha: Warlords</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil &amp; Resident Evil 0 Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 2 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 3 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 4 (2005) &amp; Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter V: Championship Edition</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-launched-today-but-its-not-easy-to-grab-one/1100-6528684/">GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs Launched Today, But It's Not Easy To Grab One</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Hopefully, that means we'll see a new single-player entry in the series soon. Either way now is a great time to be a Legacy of Kain fan. Even better, it's also a great time to get into the series if you're new to the games, too, as most of which have been re-released on modern platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Soul Reaver duology only represents one chunk of the overarching Legacy of Kain timeline. The franchise started with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, which follows Kain's transformation into a vampire, and its events serve as the basis for the rest of the series and are even revisited--and reframed--by Soul Reaver's time-hopping plot. It was followed up with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Omen 2</a>, and while it's largely disconnected from the events of Soul Reaver, it furthers Kain's characterization and Nosgoth's history. Both games are available on the PlayStation Store and on PC via GOG and Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline capped off with Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which directly follows the events of Soul Reaver 1 and 2, and features both Raziel and Kain as playable characters. Fair warning that it ends on a cliffhanger--which is part of why fans have been pining for a new game in the series--but it at least offers some closure on the events of the Soul Reaver arc and is worth grabbing after completing the remastered collection. Legacy of Kain: Defiance is only available on PC (unless you get your hands on a used PS2 copy), but it's currently <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discounted to less than $1 at GOG</a> (normally $7).</p><h2 dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain PC Game Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_12_remastered&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a> -- $22.49 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> -- $0.97 (<del>$7</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 has gotten off to a pretty strong start, adding new permanent modes with Fortnite OG and Ballistic, dropping a full-sized Godzilla on the island, and ushering in the game's Hatsune Miku era. But Chapter 6 Season 2 is just around the corner, bringing with it a whole new slate of attractions. With a few days to go before Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts, here's everything we know so far.</p><h2>When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 begin?</h2><p>Season 1 is currently scheduled to come to a close on February 21 at 11 PM PT/ 2 AM ET. That would mean that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 should begin a few hours later on the morning of Friday, February 21.</p><h2>Will Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 have a live finale event?</h2><p>The Jan. 31 update added some interesting items to the Fortnite game files, including many indications that Season 1 <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885260657940971852" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will end with some sort of ambient live event</a> on the battle royale island to bring the season story to a close. What exactly the event will entail is still a mystery, but the first stage of buildup has begun--the NPC Daigo has moved on from the spot in the Nightshift Forest where he's been battling demons all season and has taken up new residence by the unused portal in the mountains above Warrior's Watch, and that is where the big finale will go down.</p><h2>Fortnite chapter 6 Season 2 battle pass and season theme</h2><p>No part of the battle pass has leaked just yet, but we've got a big hint in the form of a theme: <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1886127448703533108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reportedly</a>, Chapter 6 Season 2 will be <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1886129502956249167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another heist season</a>. Fortnite has had a lot of heist seasons, including two different ones in Chapter 4. Since Chapter 6 already echoes Chapter 4 with the feudal theme and a throwback version of the Japan biome from that map--Seaport City is basically proto-Mega City in terms of its layout and structure, and the surrounding areas are very similar--the return of a prominent Chapter 4 theme isn't too shocking.</p><p>Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein has the seasonal tradition of teasing each upcoming season with a single word--his word for Season 12 is <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/1889054637803593935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pickled."</a> We don't know what all that terms entails, but it likely has something to do with the Kappa Kappa pickle factory that was added to the map last month, and all those little posters there that appear to depict a pickled version of Peely. So I'd expect a big pickle man skin in the battle pass, at least.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 potential collabs</h2><p>Like we said above, there aren't any confirmed details yet about Chapter 6 Season 2 cosmetics. But there are some rumored collaborations coming up that may fall into Season 2. In particular, there have been reports of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885257390993342568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cosmetics based on James Cameron's Avatar, </a>and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885281187586822448" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a customizable Iron Man skin</a>. Both of these leaked collabs could happen during Season 1, but I think that's unlikely for the Iron Man skin specifically because there are also rumors of new cosmetics tied to Captain America: Brave New World, which is in theaters on February 14.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Marvel would undercut its own timely collab for a skin that could be released literally any time, and a customizable Iron Man skin sounds more like a battle pass thing anyway, given the lack of style options we've seen among item shop collab skins for the past year. See, for example, the Iron Man Mk. 45 skin that Epic dropped in the shop last fall, which had no style options at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events lately, including Monday Night RAW in January, Royal Rumble on February 1, and also the upcoming Elimination Chamber in March. But none of the existing WWE skins have even appeared in the item shop in seven months and counting, so we're overdue for some wrestling content in Fortnite.</p><h2>Other rumors and leaks for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2</h2><p>One particularly interesting change that Epic made with Chapter 6 was to allow players to use their Festival guitars and other instruments as pickaxes and back blings, dramatically increasing the hypothetical usefulness of those cosmetics--if you like hitting things with guitars, anyway. Now, reportedly, Epic is looking at doing something similar with kicks by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1887927606747500639" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">turning the shoes that certain skins are wearing into kicks</a>--meaning, for example, that buying the Green Roots Billie skin would also grant you her green and black Air Force 1 Mids as kicks to use on any skin.</p><p>Stick around as we'll be updating this roundup of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 news, rumors, and leaks frequently as we approach the start date.</p>
