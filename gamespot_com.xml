                <p>Meta has shut down three of Oculus Studios' internal developers, new reporting has revealed. Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studio have all been impacted.</p><p>Outlets suchs as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html?ref=uploadvr.com" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> indicated that cuts were coming to Meta's Reality Labs business, which encompasses first-party VR game development. On Tuesday, developers from the three aforementioned studios <a href="https://x.com/andyTHPS/status/2011091620314431519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on X</a> and other social media websites, indicating that they had lost their jobs. </p><p><a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a> confirmed that the entirety of Twisted Pixel Games, Sanzaru Games, and Armature Studios were impacted as part of this round of Meta layoffs. In a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/meta-layoffs-vr-game-studios-twisted-pixel-sanzaru-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Meta's Tracy Clayton says these cuts were made so the company could focus on Wearables like its Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses. </p><p>It's a significant gutting that massively reduces Meta's AAA first-party development capabilities for its Quest headsets. All three studios shut down today are also quite well known, and had storied histories prior their their acquisitions by Meta.</p><p>Twisted Pixel Games initially gained fame thanks to Xbox Live Arcade titles like 'Splosion Man and Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley. It had worked on VR games for the past decade, just releasing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-deadpool-brings-the-merc-with-a-mouth-to-virtual-reality/1100-6532179/" data-ref-id="1100-6532179">Marvel's Deadpool VR</a> in November 2025.</p><p>Sanzaru Games was the studio behind Asgard's Wrath 2, which was a free pack-in title for the Meta Quest 3. Before that, it worked on the original Asgard's Wrath in VR and some Sony 3D platformer spin-offs like Secret Agent Clank and Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time.</p><p>Finally, Armature Studio was founded by former Retro Studios developers and is best known for the Xbox One console exclusive ReCore. Its most recent game was an impressive VR port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-4-vr-review-a-selection-of-good-things-stranger/1900-6417767/" data-ref-id="1900-6417767">Resident Evil 4</a> in 2021.</p><p>As it stands, Beat Saber developer Beat Games and Batman: Arkham Shadow developer Camouflaj are still in operation, so Meta's first-party development capabilities aren't completely gone. Still, it's a heavy blow to VR game development as Meta is the most prominent player in the virtual reality space. </p>

                <p>So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-2/" data-ref-id="5000-137">Fallout 2</a> and a writer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>--believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received.</p><p>When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, "They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009456971339149774%7Ctwgr%5E99f1ee048f913fdce98a2199dfe0f1e4cd7a6c94%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fzenimax-bethesda%2Flead-fallout-new-vegas-dev-says-bethesda-strayed-away-from-the-rpgs-origins" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout - and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me.</p>  — Chris Avellone (@ChrisAvellone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Avellone went on to explain that he doesn't hate Bethesda, and he praised the publisher's open-world games before calling out its weaknesses regarding its linear stories and "their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill. But every developer has their pros and cons."</p><p>Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/obsidian-was-the-only-choice-for-fallout-new-vegas-says-todd-howard/1100-6537213/" data-ref-id="1100-6537213">praised Obsidian Entertainment's work on Fallout: New Vegas</a>, and said that the studio was the only choice to handle the game. Avellone and other Obsidian employees had worked on the previous Fallout games, and that made it the ideal choice to develop New Vegas.</p><p>Later this year, PC gamers will be able to buy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-preorder-guide/1100-6536671/" data-ref-id="1100-6536671">a Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary physical bundle</a>, but console players will be left out of that.

They may get their wish, because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">remakes of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas</a> are rumored to be in development.</p>

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">described as</a> an "experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." Now, reporter Jez Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2010993531037302935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the game was "only ever a concept" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.</p><p>He added: "It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else."</p><p>In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror." The description continued: "Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible."</p><p>Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as "experimental" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a "showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium."</p><p>As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corden reported</a> that the developer's next title, which he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KPhoHILH4Wo?t=2176s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on the Xbox Two podcast</a> could be Hellblade 3, "will be more combat-involved and interactive" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.</p><p>Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.</a></p><p>2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations. The ball gets rolling on January 22, which is when Microsoft will host the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-returns-january-22-with-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/1100-6537273/" data-ref-id="1100-6537273">Xbox Developer Direct, focusing primarily on Fable and Forza Horizon 6. </a></p>
