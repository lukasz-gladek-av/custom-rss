The first game was a post-apocalyptic courier service adventure where you <em>really</em> didn't want to be caught out in the rain and it was anchored by the digital performances of Hollywood stars such as Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen.</p><p>In December 2022, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-officially-announced/1100-6509825/">Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards</a>. After years of teasing, it's full steam ahead for the sequel when it arrives in June, but even when it's so close to the finish line, we still have many questions we're hoping to have answered in Death Stranding 2. Ahead of its upcoming release, here's everything that we know about Death Stranding 2 so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Death_Stranding_2_be_released_">When will Death Stranding 2 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Death_Stranding_2">Preorder Death Stranding 2</a><ul><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2__On_the_Beach_preorder_bonuses_for_all_editions">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach preorder bonuses for all editions</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2__On_the_Beach_Digital_Deluxe_Edition">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Digital Deluxe Edition</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2__On_the_Beach_Collector_s_Edition">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach Collector's Edition</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_platforms">Death Stranding 2 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_cast">Death Stranding 2 cast</a><ul><li><a href="#Returning_from_Death_Stranding">Returning from Death Stranding</a></li><li><a href="#New_characters_introduced_in_Death_Stranding_2__On_the_Beach">New characters introduced in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></li><li><a href="#Will_Nicolas_Cage_be_in_Death_Stranding_2_">Will Nicolas Cage be in Death Stranding 2?</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_screenshots">Death Stranding 2 screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_Death_Stranding_2_be_released_"><strong>When will Death Stranding 2 be released?</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169407-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4169407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169407-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4169407"></a><figcaption>The initial Death Starnding 2 logo.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169407-deathstranding2%282%29.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will officially launch on <strong>June 26</strong></a>.

Sony was heavily involved in the development of the first game--and assisted Kojima Productions in completing the reveal trailer through its PlayStation Studios Visual Arts group--but given the company's recent approach to porting more of its console-exclusives to PC in the years since Death Stranding launched, it's highly likely that Death Stranding 2 will make its way to that platform eventually.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_Story">Death Stranding 2 Story</h2><p dir="ltr">Kojima is keeping the Death Stranding 2 story under wraps for now, but he has revealed a few details about the game since its official debut, while the first trailer has also hinted at a new calamity on the horizon as the unstoppable Death Stranding continues. The story for Death Stranding 2 that Kojima originally had in mind was thrown out after the COVID-19 pandemic hit, with Kojima remarking that he restarted from square one. "I had the story written before the pandemic. But after experiencing the pandemic, I just rewrote the whole story from scratch," Kojima said at the Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"Should we have connected" is the main crux of the story, as following Sam's journey to help establish the United Cities of America, the world has changed. Deliveries are now automated, a dangerous new cult seems to have emerged, and Higgs Monoghan has somehow managed to escape the Beach after he was stranded on it toward the end of the first game. Throw in a hulking samurai outfitted in red armor, kaiju-sized tar-monsters, and new locales, and Death Stranding 2 looks like it'll be greatly expanding on the ideas of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">"In Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, embark on an inspiring mission of human connection beyond the UCA," the official plot synopsis from Kojima Productions reads. "Sam--with companions by his side--sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles, and a haunting question: should we have connected?"</p><p dir="ltr">If you sift through the reveal trailer, there's a whole bunch of fascinating threads to explore, ranging from the state of the world after more connections had been made, the return of Fragile, who is in a much healthier state now, and possibly a multiverse of variants to deal with. For a deeper dive, you can check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/death-stranding-2-ultimate-trailer-breakdown-and-wild-speculations/2300-6460229/"> Death Stranding 2 trailer breakdown</a> for some wild speculation. In case you've missed them, here are the previous trailers that Kojima released for the game:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krnQLJYjMXo">Death Stranding 2 reveal trailer</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QGUEMSz2qY">Death Stranding 2 story trailer</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Aq_7OsgYLY">Death Stranding 2 SXSW trailer</a></li></ul><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_cast">Death Stranding 2 cast</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169406-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4169406" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169406-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4169406"></a><figcaption>Sam Porter Bridges, played by Norman Reedus in the Death Stranding games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4169406-deathstranding2%283%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kojima loves working with actors, and with a reputation as an auteur in the games industry, the game director has managed to attract some big names to his project. This time, Reedus will be joined by a few new faces as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elle-fanning-thinks-death-stranding-2-looks-pretty-amazing-but-is-going-to-get-so-much-better/1100-6511370/"> Elle Fanning</a> and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-game-features-deadpool-2-actress/1100-6508796/"> Shioli Kutsuna</a> are in the cast. Reedus once again plays Sam Porter Bridges, and he's joined by Lea Seydoux (Fragile) and Troy Baker (Higgs Monaghan), two characters from the first Death Stranding.</p><p dir="ltr">Other new actors include Mad Max director George Miller as Tarman, the captain of the DHV Magellan and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2s-latest-footage-debuts-new-characters-and-a-talking-doll/1100-6526788/"> Fatih Akin as Dollman</a>, one of the more interesting additions to the series. True to his name, Dollman is a living puppet who'll join Sam on his journey, and who isn't afraid to pick a fight with people like Higgs. Speaking of Higgs, the self-proclaimed particle in all things is sporting a wild new look, resembling a cyberpunk version of the Crow. There's also Neil, another new character who is the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-introduces-its-own-solid-snake-sort-of/1100-6529990/"> spitting image of Solid Snake from the Metal Gear Solid series</a> when he dons a bandana, as seen in the release date trailer.

dir="ltr" id="Death_Stranding_2_gameplay">Death Stranding 2 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">The first Death Stranding was essentially a puzzle game, as players had to guide Sam to his destination and figure out the best route and equipment to help him deliver his cargo in one piece. Sure, the game also had action and stealth as you were forced into fights with package-stealing Mules and the ghostly BTs haunting parts of the map, but the real core of the game was focused on the journey and the destination ahead of you. Adding an extra wrinkle to the gameplay was timefall, a weather phenomenon involving deadly rain that could steal the time of anything it landed on before becoming harmless water, and staying outside too long during one of these showers could ruin a cargo run.</p><p dir="ltr">For Death Stranding 2, it looks like that mix of genres has been expanded on. Couriering cargo, for example, looks even more dangerous thanks to other weather phenomena like bushfires, lightning storms, and avalanches. To make things easier, it looks like Sam will have access to a new fleet of vehicles that can traverse this deadly ground, as well as exoskeletons and floating carriers.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also looks like it has been beefed up, especially with all of the new enemies that you'll encounter. Human foes seem to be smarter this time. we've glimpsed horrifying hand-monsters in the wild, and we're going to need a much bigger gun to take on the skyscraper-sized tar-monsters.</p><p dir="ltr">Asynchronous multiplayer will also return in the sequel via the Social Strand system, which helped foster a feeling of connection in Death Stranding. Essentially, this allowed players to have an impact on the world, leaving behind useful tools, gadgets, and vehicles for other players to find in their expeditions once certain areas had been connected to the Chyral Network. We're not certain if or how this system has been expanded, but if it's anything like the one seen in the first game, it'll be a welcome feature as players lend a hand to each other in a dangerous world.</p><h2 id="Death_Stranding_2_soundtrack">Death Stranding 2 soundtrack</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSN1rPPKK9s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BSN1rPPKK9s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Death Stranding's soundtrack is a highlight of that game, as chill beats to relax to at the end of the world made for a meditative experience. We know that Woodkid composed the song "The Wilder" which was heard in the SXSW trailer and that you can listen to in the video above. This isn't the first time that the French music video director has worked with Kojima, as he previously teamed up with the director to create the song "Goliath" for the Death Stranding: Director's Cut trailer. Beyond that,<a href="https://youtu.be/krSy6fI0SBU?t=2038" rel="nofollow "> Woodkid also has several other tracks</a> that'll be in Death Stranding 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Scottish music trio Chvrches also contributed some of the best tracks to the game, and while they haven't been formally contacted to create some new material for the sequel, the band says that it'll be ready in a hot second if Kojima approaches them again.</p><p>"There's nothing formal yet. Weâ€™ve talked [and] we've hinted heavily at each other that we would both like to collaborate again," Chvrches synth player Martin Doherty<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chvrches-talks-death-stranding-2-is-ready-to-return-if-kojima-calls/1100-6512094/">said in March</a>. "There's sort of a dance going on right now. I don't want to be rejected by all out saying, 'Can we be on the game please?' and [Kojima] says no. But I donâ€™t know. We're continuing to build a really special relationship with Hideo. And I think we get him and I think he gets us. If the call comes in to do more then of course, we'll be there in a second."</p>

                <p>The first Battlefield Labs test took place recently for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, and while participants were prohibited from sharing footage publicly, that's exactly what happened.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-playtest-gameplay-shows-whats-next-for-the-franchise/1100-6529982/" data-ref-id="1100-6529982"> Lots of gameplay footage and new information emerged</a>. Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has now reacted to this, saying he is "not OK" with leaks.</p><p>"I am not OK with leaks; they are dealt with accordingly as well," Sirland said on <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899346999545086390" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> when asked for his thoughts.</p><p>A new Battlefield feature, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-6-gameplay-footage-reveals-two-big-changes/1100-6529992/" data-ref-id="1100-6529992">the ability to drag a downed teammate to safety</a>, was among the many things that leaked out of the early tests. Sirland said this will be a "key feature in the revive loop," going on to say he's expecting to see "some interesting use" in the next test.</p><p>Sirland was also asked if EA might considering dropping the requirement for participants to sign a non-disclosure agreement for future tests. He didn't confirm anything but <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1899415906104512741" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">laid out the developer's position</a>:</p><p>"We have loads of feedback from the very active testers selected. In good amounts and in the right areas for us to be able to use it. There is a rationale to the approach we are taking, and it's working well so far. There will be more tests and we'll open up to more over time."</p><p>It's not too late to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to possibly get into a future test.

                <p>Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has credited the story of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> as being one of the primary factors behind the Capcom game's breakout success.</p><p>Tsujimoto, who was recently promoted to become Capcom's Chief Product Officer, stated this in an interview with <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUF05BK60V00C25A3000000/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei</a>, a Japanese publication. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-story-driven-approach-contributed-to-its-success-says-series-producer/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> then reported his comments, which explained that Tsujimoto believed players enjoyed how Monster Hunter Wilds emphasized its story more than previous Monster Hunter games and how its immersiveness was heightened as the game was fully voiced. He also credited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-first-major-update-will-add-a-lot-in-april/1100-6529750/" data-ref-id="1100-6529750">cross-play</a> with drawing many people to the game and getting them to stick around.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_wNFT4j6qI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and sold 8 million copies during its first three days on the market. On March 10, Circana's Executive Director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lk25o4kkvk2d" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed on Bluesky</a> that Monster Hunter Wilds had the highest launch-week dollar sales for any game since Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and that it ranked 1 in weekly dollar sales across all three platforms it was available on.</p><p>GameSpot liked Monster Hunter Wilds, but wasn't as fond of its story as Tsujimoto is.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Chrono Trigger is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, March 11, 2025. Below, we explore how its innovative New Game Plus feature set it apart as an all-time classic.</em></p><p dir="ltr">I spent almost an entire summer vacation repeatedly replaying Chrono Trigger. At the peak of the dog days, when I was content to stay indoors with the air conditioning (and my parents were content to let me), I was completing a full playthrough every few days. This was a welcome proposition thanks to New Game Plus, which still stands as a major part of Chrono Trigger's legacy and a critical, irremovable piece of its brilliant design.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was not the first game to feature an optional way to continue playing after beating the game. Other games, like The Legend of Zelda, featured second quests or post-credits challenges. But Chrono Trigger did coin the term New Game Plus, and it popularized the idea as it's currently understood. As opposed to an extra challenge for those who had mastered the game, Chrono Trigger's NG+ allowed you to start the game again with all of your experience, skills, and any items or equipment that wasn't critical to the plot. Rather than challenge you to complete a second quest with your newfound mastery, it rewarded you by making the game easier and faster--a breezy romp through a story you already knew and probably loved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457654"></a><figcaption>New Game Plus in Chrono Trigger | Image credit: Thonky.com</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4457654-new-game-plus.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's important to understand this innovation in its context. Before we were awash in too many games to count or those indefinitely expanding with new content, most of us were replaying relatively short single-player games regularly. RPGs were a heavier lift, because they demanded so much of your time. Replaying an RPG wasn't unheard of, but it was a commitment. Squaresoft cleverly found a simple way to remove the high time and commitment barrier and allow players to play RPGs over again easily.</p><p dir="ltr">Put simply, Square recognized that persistent progression is a major component in our enjoyment of RPGs. Unlike a game like Super Mario World, which is primarily about playing and testing platforming skills, RPG players form close connections with their parties and builds, from their chosen skills to equipment to decisions and relationships. Shaking the Etch-a-Sketch clean just feels different for an RPG, and while it can certainly be enjoyable to start an RPG over with a completely fresh slate, it can be even more satisfying to keep your powerful characters intact and breeze through encounters that previously gave you some trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger was an especially great testing ground for this novel concept. The time-traveling RPG famously sported <a href="https://chrono.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Chrono_Trigger_endings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple endings</a>. These were based primarily on your decision of when and how to confront Lavos, an ancient evil that laid in wait, infesting the world for millions of years before ushering in doomsday in the distant future. To even attempt to take on Lavos early would require a party advanced well past the point that would be realistic for players to have early in the game. Jumping throughout time and experimenting with engaging Lavos at different points was both a plot payoff and only functionally possible through New Game Plus.</p><p>The multiple endings were a major draw meant to support multiple playthroughs, as many of them gave you a better understanding of the world and its events, the unfortunate consequences of action or inaction, and the many ultimate destinies of its cast. Some characters' fates were immutable no matter what you did. Others could be changed in small ways that impacted their lives. Still others could have major ramifications on the world. Seeing all of these timelines intertwined and in communication with each other makes the whole experience richer and more textured. The New Game Plus feature was an important tool, making it hassle-free to keep experimenting and discovering new possibilities.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsflIgDpvhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsflIgDpvhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>On a metatextual level, the time-traveling conceit implied, even if it did not overtly recognize, the idea of cyclical patterns. Perhaps the new Crono whose mom woke him up to meet his friend at the Millennial Fair really had lived a thousand lives before and become a powerful warrior ready to defeat a world-ending alien. It makes a certain degree of intuitive sense even if the story doesn't directly call attention to it.</p><p dir="ltr">And like the best platforming games, the flexibility of the system allowed players to invent their own fun. The heady summer I spent replaying Chrono Trigger, I set the goal to keep replaying until I had a full array of Prism armor for every character--an extremely powerful and limited item that can only be obtained once per playthrough. Achieving that goal may not have been necessary, but it felt uniquely satisfying in a way that was only made possible by New Game Plus.</p><p dir="ltr">While Chrono Trigger deserves plaudits as the game to coin and popularize New Game Plus as a mechanic, it has also retained its title as one of the best examples of it, even decades later. Many games have been content to offer the option to replay with your gear intact, but Chrono Trigger had the vision to weave it into the narrative and make it an integral part of the experience. Playing it two or more times isn't an optional nice-to-have; it's core to the designers' intent.</p><p dir="ltr">Chrono Trigger is an impeccably designed RPG in many ways, from the lovable characters and beautiful art design to its stirring score. It certainly deserves to be remembered for all of those reasons and more. But perhaps the reason it stands out in the collective memories of so many RPG fans of my generation is because it was the first game of its kind to invite us to experience all of those elements over and over again, strengthening our memories and creating new ones every time.</p>

                <p>Some hardcore PC game genres have had a renaissance in recent years. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> reinvigorated love for the CPRG, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-625869">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> tapped into a communal love for hardcore first-person RPGs that hadn't been satiated in a while. Not all classic PC gaming genres have been so lucky. We've yet to see a new stealth-tactics game like Commandos or a dungeon management game like Dungeon Keeper become a breakout hit. That's not for lack of trying, as games like Desperados 3 and Evil Genius 2: World Domination have kept the legacy of these genres going, albeit in a way that has stayed niche. Kuuasema's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cthulhu-keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-663255">Cthulhu Keeper</a> aims to resurrect these struggling genres and become that surprise success.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is a real-time tactics game split into two parts: One half sees players building up their home base of operations and defending it from intruders, while the other sees the player command cultists and Lovecraftian monsters with special abilities to complete stealth missions. I had the chance to go hands-on with Cthulhu Keeper exclusively following its reveal last month, and I found it to be an entertaining hybrid of those classic PC game genres.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuZ7OQEMCk8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LuZ7OQEMCk8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The version of Cthulhu Keeper I played didn't have much narrative content, although the eldritch theming still emanated from everything I played. There's no shortage of Lovecraftian video games out there, but the distinct perspective of Cthulhu Keeper helps it stand out. As I hear my subjects say, "Yes, master" after I give them commands during stealth missions and slowly amass power by building my cult's compound, I feel like a puppet master in the way Cthulhu and other horrors often are in Lovecraftian tales.</p><p dir="ltr">That vibe remains strong when I'm commanding minions within my cult compound, digging out areas so I can build altars, libraries, and other structures to increase my power and defend against potential intruders. Then, when intruders arrived--they ranged from genuine snoopers to a lovey-dovey couple who ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time--I could see everything I built work in harmony to keep those invaders at bay.</p><p dir="ltr">Management games like Two Point Museum are good fun, but I appreciate how Cthulhu Keeper is more in tune with the gameplay loop that made Dungeon Keeper such a classic. This cult compound gameplay is the backbone of Cthulhu Keeper, but building defenses or earning upgrades does require resources. To earn those resources, I had to venture out and complete stealth missions around the world. This part of Cthulhu Keeper is what plays more like Commandos, or contemporary examples like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/desperados-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-486056">Desperados 3</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sumerian-six/" data-ref-id="5000-631984">Sumerian Six</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457636"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457636-cthulhukeeper.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stealth missions took two different forms. There are story missions that serve as the set piece levels, while expeditions were mini-roguelite runs where I had to strategically get my units through a series of smaller encounters as unscathed as possible. I love stealth-tactics games because they reward my smart planning but also require me to think on my toes based on how enemies react to my actions.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper does not reinvent this style of gameplay; I still have to delicately choose where to place my units to navigate around enemy vision cones and smartly utilize each unit's abilities to kill enemies or open up opportunities to move past a unit without getting spotted. Player units are fragile, so I wasn't successful in Cthulhu Keeper whenever I tried to run and gun through a scenario.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lovecraftian twists Cthulhu Keeper applies to this tried-and-true formula do provide a unique flair within the stealth-tactics space. When I started missions, I only had one unit to command: Lilith West, a corrupted neurobiologist. Lilith could stealthily kill an enemy just fine, but she doesn't have much in the way of offensive abilities. Instead, her skills focused on increasing the number of units at my disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">After killing an enemy, I could harvest their corpse to get an eyeball or choose to reanimate them. The former would allow me to see an enemy's vision cone and surroundings even if they were out of my sightline, while the latter would create a whole new unit I could use to attack enemies or damage the sanity of civilians scattered throughout each level. Once I terrified a civilian, I could have Lilith use her Enlighten ability to turn them into a unit under my command.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4457637"></a><figcaption>Cthulhu Keeper</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4457637-cthulhukeeperstealthmission.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">These units couldn't kill enemies but were useful for scouting areas or temporarily stunning enemies so I could get past them. Occasionally, I would encounter a pylon in a level and destroy it to summon eldritch monsters. These monsters were the units that could tear through enemy forces, but even then, I had to carefully manage their health to ensure they did not die. That was particularly tough in the lengthy story mission, as I could no longer rely on quickly running to an encounter's exit to move on.</p><p dir="ltr">Even from this light smattering of encounters, I'm already enjoying the stealth-tactics part of Cthulhu Keeper as much as I enjoy games like Desperados 3. When a game juggles two different genres of gameplay, it risks becoming a jack of all trades but a master of none. I did not get that feeling while playing Cthulhu Keeper, as I found it to provide equally polished and engaging takes on stealth-tactics and dungeon-defending gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also a solid entry point to both of these hardcore genres. The menus and currencies required to build out the cult compound aren't overly complex. Meanwhile, the bite-sized encounters of expeditions should make learning the intricacies of stealth tactics less overwhelming and reliant on save-scumming. Cthulhu Keeper could reanimate PC gaming genres that have struggled to have a breakout hit in recent years, Lovecraftian-style.</p><p dir="ltr">Cthulhu Keeper is in development for PC. A public playtest for the game will begin on March 17.</p>
