                <p>Elden Ring's Switch 2 port is not going to release on time. From Software and Bandai Namco have confirmed that the Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition for Nintendo's console has been pushed to 2026.</p><p>Development "continues wholeheartedly," the developer said in a statement. But a delay was necessary to give the team time for "performance adjustments."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">people who played Elden Ring on Switch 2 said it was in rough shape</a>, with the frame rate in particular getting called out for being poor. Bandai Namco <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/" data-ref-id="1100-6534171">forbade media from showing footage of the game</a>, so we haven't actually seen it in action as of yet, however.</p><p>"We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support," the developer said about the delay.</p><p>The Tarnished Edition includes the base game and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Author George R.R. Martin worked on Elden Ring's backstory and lore.</p><p>Elden Ring was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/top-10-best-selling-games-of-2022-in-the-us/1100-6510556/">No. 2 best-selling game of 2022 in the US</a> and sold <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fromsoftware/comments/1hew72p/elden_ring_has_sold_over_286_million_copies_as_of/#:~:text=Full_Data_6240-,Elden%20Ring%20has%20sold%20over%2028.6%20million%20copies%20as%20of,IP%20of%20modern%20console%20generation" rel="nofollow ">nearly 30 million copies as of the end of 2024</a> across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. No sequel has been announced, but the standalone multiplayer spin-off, Elden Ring Nightreign, came out this past May. It's not confirmed for Switch 2, however.</p><p>Assuming it releases in 2026, Elden Ring will join From Software's The Duskbloods in launching for Switch 2 next year. That is a new action-RPG exclusive to Switch 2 developed by From Software and directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki.</p>

                <p>With Fallout Day finally here and the internet buzzing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">talk of remakes, remasters</a>, and maybe even a brand-new entry in Bethesda's iconic post-apocalyptic series, one Hollywood star has jumped into the conversation. Actor Danny Trejo, the fan-favorite tough guy from From Dusk Till Dawn, Machete, and Spy Kids--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/check-out-this-fallout-4-danny-trejo-character/1100-6433701/" data-ref-id="1100-6433701">and huge Fallout fan</a>--made his opinion crystal clear <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fallout/p/DQHdlH_jQeS/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on social media</a>: He wants Fallout: New Vegas back--and now.</p><p>Trejo, who actually voiced the ghoul mechanic Raul Alfonso Tejada in New Vegas, commented on Bethesda's official Instagram post with, "Remaster New Vegas boss!" followed by a fire emoji. That message sent shockwaves through the Wasteland, garnering almost 1,600 likes.</p><p>Unfortunately, Trejo's wish wasn’t included in Bethesda’s official lineup for Fallout Day. During the celebration, the studio is set to show off more from Fallout 76's upcoming Burning Springs expansion out this December, and yes, that includes Walton Goggins returning as The Ghoul from the hit Fallout TV series. There are also updates coming to Fallout 4 and Fallout Shelter, plus new content via Creations, Bethesda's name for officially supported community mods. Fans can also expect merch drops, live events, and a post-show dedicated to the ever-passionate Fallout community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664" data-ratio="0.64071856287425" data-width="1169" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4589664"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Instagram/Lan Pitts</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4589664-falloutscreenshot.jpg"></figure><p>Fallout has had a pretty good year in reaching fans outside the games, partially thanks to the success of the Prime Video show. It even had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/universal-teases-fallout-and-five-nights-at-freddys-halloween-horror-nights-houses/1100-6533789/" data-ref-id="1100-6533789">its own haunted house at this year's Halloween Horror Nights</a> at Universal Studios. Professional sports are getting in on the fun with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pro-hockey-team-is-hosting-fallout-night-in-partnership-with-bethesda/1100-6535586/" data-ref-id="1100-6535586">themed jerseys for Fallout Night</a>.</p><p>Still, the rumor mill is spinning faster than a Gatling laser. With The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered now out and whispers of a Fallout 3 remaster having leaked back in 2023, fans are convinced that New Vegas might not be far behind. And while everyone's dreaming of a full Fallout 5 reveal, Bethesda has made it clear that it won't happen anytime soon, as the team is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">focusing on The Elder Scrolls VI first</a>.</p><p>Bethesda boss Todd Howard reminded fans earlier this year that the studio doesn't want to rush its next big project. "We totally get the desire for a new single-player game," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ew8LQFGNWU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he told YouTuber MrMattyPlays last year</a>. "But these things take time--we just want to get it right."</p><p>The last mainline Fallout release was Fallout 4 back in 2015, followed by Fallout 76 in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-is-more-popular-than-ever-on-steam-thanks-to-the-tv-show/1100-6522828/" data-ref-id="1100-6522828">which found a new surge of popularity thanks to Prime Video's Fallout TV show</a>. So while the vault door to Fallout 5 may stay sealed for a while longer, it's clear Bethesda wants every future entry to be a true nuclear event in gaming history.</p>
