                <p>Earlier this month, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself "checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.</p><p>Other players have already noticed this and released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a less DLC checks mod</a> that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.</p><p>Capcom had previously promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update released this winter</a> would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.</p>

What was once a very popular Minecraft server is now its own standalone experience that rivals Mojang's massive survival game in some ways, with plans to challenge it a lot more over time, no doubt. If you're jumping into Hytale to see what all the hype is about, you'll benefit from our guides on the game, which tackle the burning questions players may have as the game is now in early access.</p><h2>Starter guides</h2><p>The guides we have on Hytale for now all comfortably fit under one category: starter guides. This is because the game has only just launched and, by the studio's own admission, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hytale-console-version-planned-but-developers-want-to-focus-on-making-a-good-game-first/1100-6537393/" data-ref-id="1100-6537393">there's plenty of work still to be done</a>.</p><p>For now, you can jump into Hytale and enjoy an experience much like the early hours of Minecraft. You'll build a modest home, begin crafting objects, and probably wind up dead in a mine somewhere, only to respawn at your bed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4636334-5e7ba47d3c9a2a00106793a2_113___trork_camp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636334" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4636334-5e7ba47d3c9a2a00106793a2_113___trork_camp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636334"></a><figcaption>It may be a few hours before you find yourself in a situation like the one depicted here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4636334-5e7ba47d3c9a2a00106793a2_113___trork_camp.jpg"></figure><p>Over time, as the game becomes more elaborate via updates and (presumed) expansions, we'll continue to build out our Hytale guides hub to tackle more topics that may be stumping you. <strong>If there's no link on a subject, that guide is coming soon!</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-hytale-editions-price-and-more/1100-6537363/" data-ref-id="1100-6537363">How to play Hytale: editions, price, and specs</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-multiplayer-in-hytale/1100-6537377/" data-ref-id="1100-6537377">How to play Hytale multiplayer</a></li><li>How to set up a Hytale server</li><li>What to do first in Hytale</li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">All Hytale workbenches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">All Hytale weapons</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-armor-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537448/" data-ref-id="1100-6537448">All Hytale armor</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-increase-inventory-space-in-hytale-backpack-upgrade-guide/1100-6537445/" data-ref-id="1100-6537445">How to increase inventory space in Hytale</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-hytale-mods/2900-7397/" data-ref-id="2900-7397">Best Hytale mods</a></li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more Hytale guides in due time, adventurer.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> was one of the big hits from 2025, and Embark isn't going to let that momentum wane in 2026. The studio has indicated that there are multiple new maps on the horizon, as well as an upcoming content roadmap.</p><p>"There are going to be multiple maps coming this year," said Arc Raiders design lead Virgil Watkins during an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/there-are-going-to-be-multiple-maps-coming-this-year-arc-raiders-dev-teases-2026-roadmap-and-maybe-some-new-maps-even-grander-than-what-weve-got-now/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "And I think it's going to be across a spectrum of size to try to facilitate different types of gameplay. So you might see some that are smaller, and you might see some that are even grander than what we've got now."</p><p>Watkins didn't share specific details about what will be featured in the new maps, but he added that "the ambition is to try to pair it with some new type of experience, whether that's the map conditions or weather conditions we put in that make the play feel different, enemy types or compositions feeling different, or we're escalating the types of loot available there."</p><p>As for the Arc Raiders content roadmap, Watkins suggested that it will be released "sometime soon." In the meantime, he confirmed that Embark is working on new weapons, objectives, and enemies in addition to the maps.</p><p>Embark has also shared details and stats about its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-threw-a-lot-of-snowballs-in-the-cold-snap-event/1100-6537434/" data-ref-id="1100-6537434">recently concluded Cold Snap event in Arc Raiders</a>. According to Embark's numbers, 91 million players were knocked out by snowballs, but just under 11,000 enemies were taken out the same way.</p><p>To date, Arc Raiders has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-get-this-free-pickaxe-as-game-passes-12-million-copies-sold/1100-6537346/" data-ref-id="1100-6537346">passed 12.4 million in sales</a>, it has earned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">hundreds of millions of dollars</a> in revenue.

                <p>There are few things more important in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">all Hytale weapons</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_armor_in_Hytale">How to craft armor in Hytale</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165" data-ratio="0.53521126760563" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165"></a><figcaption>A character donning some rare armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg"></figure><p>If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><p>Before you rush into trying to craft armor, though, you'll need the right Workbench. All armor can be crafted at an Armorer's Workbench, but some higher-tier armor requires a tier two or tier three Armorer's Workbench. You can find out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">how build the Armorer's Workbench</a> and upgrade it to higher tiers in our previous guide.</p><h2 id="All_armor_crafting_recipes_in_Hytale">All armor crafting recipes in Hytale</h2><p>You can find every single crafting recipe for all types of armor in Hytale.

Perhaps future updates will start to include some of the ultra-rare armor and weapons that we can currently see and equip in Creative, but this is what we have available in Survival at the start of early access in Hytale.</p>
