                <p>Blizzard's Overwatch 2 team has unionized. The wall-to-wall union--referred to as the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild--includes nearly 200 developers, ranging from artists and QA testers to writers and engineers. It is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">second union to form at the company since last July</a>, when the team behind Blizzard's hit MMO World of Warcraft successfully formed a union of its own. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced the union in a press release shared with <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> earlier today, writing that "an overwhelming majority of workers" supported the initiative.</p><p>"Game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall union," the CWA wrote. "A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal."</p><p>With the Overwatch 2 team's unionization, the number of unionized game developers working at Microsoft now exceeds 2,000 employees. However, the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild now has to bargain for its first contract--a process that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">accused of dragging out</a>.</p><p>According to Simon Hedrick, a test analyst at Blizzard, the layoffs at the beginning of 2024 were largely what motivated the team to unionize. Hedrick told <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> that "Up to that moment I'd been really happy in what I was doing.” Hedrick of course refers to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">sweeping layoffs by Microsoft</a> last January, in which the tech giant cut over 1,900 people from its video game division, including Blizzard president Mike Ybarra.</p><p>"People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it," Hedrick told Kotaku.</p><p>In addition to the looming threat of layoffs, the Overwatch 2 team also cited pay disparities, work-from-home restrictions, and wanting certain protections--such as freedom from crunch and guaranteed severance packages--as contributing factors to their unionization. According to Kotaku, Blizzard employees have repeatedly stressed that "improving their working conditions can also lead to better games," while layoffs and uncompetitive pay makes them worse.</p><p>Blizzard UI Artist Sadie Boyd also weighed in on the decision to unionize, telling Kotaku "We're not just a number on an Excel sheet. We want to make games but we can't do it without a sense of security."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – 21 Minutes Of Official Grand Prix and Free Roam Gameplay | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson said.</p><p dir="ltr">The images in question were billboards with text like "We Build Your Town" or "We Build Your Dreams" accompanied by odd images, like an under-construction skyscraper with strange pathways. Another image that had fans wondering was one of a car with unusually large windows and small tires, something that looked similar to what a generative AI might cook up.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Mario Kart World isn't yet out, it's possible what was shown in the gameplay livestream was simply placeholder or unfinished art. Regardless, Nintendo's statement seems fairly definitive, so fans worried about the use of AI art in the $80 game can rest easy (even if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">Nintendo has not done a great job justifying its price</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">With the game's June 5 release coming fast, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">everything we currently know about Mario Kart World</a>, ranging from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">number of playable characters</a> to all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">Mario Kart World's items</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-game-accessory-preorders-are-live/1100-6530753/" data-ref-id="1100-6530753">Mario Kart World and accessories are currently available for preorder</a>.

                <p><strong>Update</strong>: As of 11:15 AM PT / 2:15 PM ET, this issue appears to be resolved--and just in time for Mace Windu to hit the shop tonight.</p><p><strong>Original story</strong>: The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> item shop has ballooned in recent years. In 2018 or so, you might find a new character skin, or "outfit," in there a few times per week. These days, it's a megastore full of licensed music, muscle cars, virtual Lego playsets, Marvel heroes, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-in-the-fortnite-item-shop-today-november-2-2021-el-chapulin-colorado-arrives/1100-6497610/" data-ref-id="1100-6497610">the protagonist of a 1970s Mexican superhero sitcom</a>, for reasons that still elude me to this day. But today the shop looks very different: It's almost entirely empty.</p><p>As you might expect, this isn't intentional, and Epic has said it's working on a fix, but it's rather jarring to see the shop so devoid of in-game purchases, given how many tabs of colorful digital toys it's usually lined with these days.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We're investigating an issue where the in-game Shop and Web Item Shop may appear empty.<br>We'll provide an update once this is resolved. <a href="https://t.co/cLlcJrdEB2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/cLlcJrdEB2</a></p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1920888048914514198?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 9, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The only things for sale currently are the few items purchased with local currency rather than V-Bucks, as well as the level skips for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-star-wars-battle-pass-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-6523/" data-ref-id="2900-6523">Fortnite Star Wars battle pass</a>. This includes things like a Fortnite Crew subscription, and "starter packs" that tend to include a few bundled items for cheap. Everything else has vanished like your total crowns on a season launch day.</p><p>It's unclear what has caused this error, but it may be related to Epic's continued woes surrounding the item shop. Since its user experience overhaul, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-item-shop-wont-stop-being-weird/1100-6520635/" data-ref-id="1100-6520635">the Fortnite virtual store has routinely expressed some confusing, often slightly comical, problems</a>. Then again, perhaps today's issue comes as the result of some advantageous changes to the Epic Games Store, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-makes-buying-v-bucks-a-lot-more-rewarding/1100-6531431/" data-ref-id="1100-6531431">which will now see players getting back 20% of their money spent V-Bucks purchases through Epic directly</a>, as the company gears up to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-returning-to-us-ios-soon-after-judge-slams-apple-for-insubordination/1100-6531258/" data-ref-id="1100-6531258">Fortnite back on iOS</a> around the globe.</p><p>Whatever the cause of today's slip-up, it's likely to be resolved soon, so don't fret; the TikTok dances, anthropomorphic fruit, and Rocket League imports will return.</p>
