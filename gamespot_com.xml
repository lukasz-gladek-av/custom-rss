During today's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-direct-showcase-announced-for-this-week-with-metal-gear-solid-and-silent-hill/1100-6532278/" data-ref-id="1100-6532278">Konami Direct Showcase</a>, the new online multiplayer mode was officially announced as Fox Hunt. However, it won't simply be a rehash of MGO.</p><p>During Konami's presentation, Fox Hunt director Yu Sahara described it as "camouflage and hide-and-go-seek to the next level," before adding that players will have the choice of remaining hidden with their advanced camo or attempting to find their own hidden foes. He added that it shares the same world as Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but the gameplay will be "completely different."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDLzPdKuOkE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDLzPdKuOkE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Metal Gear Online was originally released in 2008 alongside Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. While Sahara acknowledged the similarities between Fox Hunt and MGO, he added that the former "will be its own new type of mode" because the online landscape has drastically changed since changed since MGO in Metal Gear Solid 4 and Metal Gear Solid V.</p><p>Shara promised that more information about Fox Hunt will be released soon. In the meantime, Konami showed off Snake Eater's Ape Escape crossover, Snake vs. Monkey, which will be available on PS5 and PC. Xbox Series X|S is getting a Snake vs. Bomberman mode instead.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be released on PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on August 28.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, the horror film titans at Blumhouse announced a video games label and brought its first game as a publisher, Fear The Spotlight, to Summer Game Fest. I eventually reviewed that one and found it to be a worthy entry-level horror game. It was creepy, but not overly scary, and made for a reasonable gateway into the genre for younger or less experienced players. At Summer Game Fest 2025, Blumhouse showed off two more games that, while perhaps not specifically for beginners, do well to express Blumhouse Games' publishing vision.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grave-seasons/" data-ref-id="5000-631819">Grave Seasons</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crisol-theater-of-idols/" data-ref-id="5000-601756">Crisol: Theater of Idols</a> are each horror games, but couldn't be more different otherwise. The former is 2D, the latter is 3D. Grave Seasons is presented in third-person, while Crisol is played in first-person. Grave Seasons is also a dark twist on farming sims, whereas Crisol blends elements of recent Resident Evil games with BioShock, all set in a world inspired by Spanish art and folklore. Blumhouse brought these two games to Summer Game Fest 2025, giving me a preview of what's to come from a publisher that is technically still in its infancy, but also carries the name recognition and reputation of one of modern horror's biggest brands.</p><p dir="ltr">In the movie world, it feels like one out of every two horror films displays Blumhouse's logo in their opening moments. While I'm sure that's not literally true, it's certainly the case that the production company has its hands in all kinds of horror productions, from major series like The Conjuring and Paranormal Activity to legendary one-offs like Get Out and 2020's remake of The Invisible Man. The prospect of the company getting into horror video games is an exciting one for me, as I hope the publisher can use a keen eye to lift notable projects out of obscurity.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Gj9vincgw4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7Gj9vincgw4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We have this internal saying: 'We're making all different flavors of horror games for everyone,' Blumhouse's Ara Josefsson told me after my demos with the publisher's SGF 2025 slate. "People think of horror, and maybe they have a very siloed perception of what that would be based on where they come from. Is it body horror? Is it jump scares? But there's actually a pretty big spectrum of what horror games are. I think our future games will impress upon that as well."</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Grave Seasons and Crisol, Blumhouse has already announced several future games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sleep-awake/" data-ref-id="5000-631820">Sleep Awake</a> is a first-person horror adventure from the interesting pairing of Spec Ops: The Line's director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails' guitarist Robin Finck about a dystopian world without sleep. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-simulation/" data-ref-id="5000-631821">The Simulation</a> is a VR title about investigating a horror game not known to have existed before. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-c/" data-ref-id="5000-615695">Project C</a>, admittedly the one I'm personally most excited about, is the next Sam Barlow game, and this time he's enlisted Brandon Cronenberg for what is likely to be something gruesome, if the latter's filmography is a reliable clue about the mysterious game.</p><p dir="ltr">Grave Seasons' pitch is perhaps the most compelling of the whole list so far, though. The game's Stardew-like setup soon gives way to a violent murder--and a murder mystery follows. Blending the gameplay elements of something like a Stardew Valley with a story about a serial killer seems poised to toy with the genre's usual romance angles and gamified friendships. I'm eager to see how the game might spin the neighborhood cast of characters into a whodunnit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5oNGQ4KWPg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/y5oNGQ4KWPg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Crisol's art style was impressive, too, and I'm most looking forward to playing this one in the developers' native language, Spanish, once it releases. The gunplay was rough in my demo, as aiming down sights proved to be unreliable, but I'm hoping that gets improved before it releases later this year. Making up for that roughness was the game's clever wrinkle: You reload your gun with your own blood, so you'll have to balance your ammo against your own health. In my time with the game, I found myself having to combat my habit of reloading after every encounter, which added a challenging layer to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two things I've found to be true about horror fans: rarely do they like just one kind of horror, and often they're obsessive about the genre. Blumhouse isn't the only games label pulling diverse, smaller-sized horror projects into the limelight--DreadXP has been doing it for years and Critical Reflex is a new label showing signs of similar intentions--but like Annapurna does for weird (complimentary) art games, Blumhouse's name recognition does some heavy lifting for the horror games it signs. Even if, like Blumhouse's movies, they don't all prove to be winners, I'm looking forward to experimenting with whatever projects they reveal for the foreseeable future.</p>

The 2.0 Storm's Brewing update adds deadly storms and new enemy types, and  it makes biomes harsher to survive. Here's everything you need to know about the 7 Days To Die 2.0 Storm's Brewing update, including how to watch early gameplay and join the beta build.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Storm's Brewing makes major environmental changes</h2><p dir="ltr">The 2.0 Storm's Brewing update adds a new layer to survival. The zombies won't be the only threat players need to fear, as the update adds new dynamic weather to survive. Each biome will have its own unique storm, and each one will feature a different scale of difficulty to survive. These are deadly and only give players a short amount of time to seek or build shelter before they start taking damage.</p>

There are also new zombie types specific to certain biomes and game stages. The developer stream showed off the Plague Spitter zombie for the forest biome, and the yeti-like Frost Claw found in the snow biome.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4512671-frostclaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512671" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4512671-frostclaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512671"></a><figcaption>New Frost Claw enemy type</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4512671-frostclaw.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other changes and quality-of-life improvements include:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">New perks and rebalancing of the perk system</li><li dir="ltr">50 new POIs</li><li dir="ltr">New HUD and player elemental VFX and Sound FX</li><li dir="ltr">Players can now spawn near other players when starting a new server/playthrough</li><li dir="ltr">Improved random map generation</li><li dir="ltr">Improved performance and visuals for trees and foliage</li><li dir="ltr">Cosmetic clothing equipment slots</li><li dir="ltr">A new book series for the sledgehammer weapon class</li><li dir="ltr">The Navezgane map will be updated for the upcoming biome, POI, and overall map-generation changes</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">How to watch and play 2.0 Storm's Brewing early</h2><p dir="ltr">The official stable launch for 7 Days To Die 2.0 Storm's Brewing arrives on June 30 for both PC and consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">However, players can get familiar with the new content during a Streamer Weekend during June 13-15, as content creators will go hands-on with the experiential build for the Storm's Brewing update.

                <p>A new Silent Hill game is in development, as Konami has announced that the studio behind the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, Bloober Team, will be remaking the very first game in the series. The reveal came at the end of the Konami Press Start Live showcase, as a short video was played and featured background music from the game. In a press release, Konami confirmed that it is the 1999 game being remade, and on social media, the company referenced an infamous quote from the game:</p><p>The original Silent Hill gave fans of survival-horror an alternative to Capcom's Resident Evil games. While it featured similar survival-horror themes, Silent Hill's deep focus on psychological terror made it stand out, and its sequel is still highly regarded as one of the best games of all time.</p><p>The franchise has made a big return, as in addition to Bloober Team's critically acclaimed remake of Silent Hill 2, a brand-new game in the series will launch in September. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-release-date-trailers-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6510045/" data-ref-id="1100-6510045">Silent Hill F marks a big departure</a> from previous games, as it shifts from the titular town of Silent Hill to Japan. The game will also focus heavily on Japanese horror, as it combines grotesque creatures pulled from local folklore with beautiful imagery.</p><p>Bloober is also busy working on a new game of its own--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-silent-hill-2-cronos-the-new-dawn-might-complete-bloober-teams-redemption-arc/1100-6532234/" data-ref-id="1100-6532234">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>--a sci-fi horror that looks like Dead Space with a time-travel twist. The studio announced earlier this year that it had signed a new deal with Konami, but at the time, it didn't specify what it was working on for the company.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When I was first asked to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/spine/" data-ref-id="5000-537140">Spine</a> at Summer Game Fest 2025, I hadn't heard of it yet. I <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1731290/SPINE__This_is_Gun_Fu/" rel="nofollow">looked it up on Steam</a> and thought it looked pretty rad, so I booked an appointment, though I also expected it would kick my butt. Sometimes that's the job, and that's okay. I compared it to Sifu in my mind, which I always found to be really difficult. However, once I got to go hands-on with it, I found it's more like a Batman Arkham game in terms of its combat gameplay. Those familiar mechanics helped me look stylish and deadly in my demo, and put Spine on my radar ahead of its launch next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes from Nekki, a team that has previously developed mobile games, including the popular Shadow Fight series. Even Spine originally began as a mobile game, but as the project grew and took on a different shape, the team realized it had an opportunity to make its debut on PC and consoles. Inspired by the career works of John Woo and other stylish action movies, Spine is a "gun-fu" combat game in a cyberpunk setting with a simple story setup.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl_9oQgLVLM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nl_9oQgLVLM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In it, you play as Redline, a character whose physical look is so cool in my opinion that it got me to book the demo. The punky street artist's origin story is much like John Wick's, though instead of a dead dog, it's her kidnapped brother who compels her to get into ass-kicking mode. The 15-20 hour game is said to start small in terms of Redline's motivation and increase the stakes from there. What she expects is a personal quest to save her brother soon pulls her into a criminal underworld of AI overlords and corrupt people in power across the colorful but troubled city.</p><p dir="ltr">In my time with the game, I lit up bad guys in bars, hallways, and rooftops with roundhouse kicks, haymakers, and blasts of my dual-wielded pistols. The game wears its inspirations on its sleeve. This is a game from people who unabashedly love movies like The Matrix and Hard Boiled. Nekki isn't shying away from that, perhaps best displayed in its hallway fight scene reminiscent of Oldboy. It's leaning into it. But I was happy to see the game uses combat systems more like the Batman Arkham series, in which it's not too tough to chain together attack combos, execute well-timed counters to keep chains alive, and periodically switch to finishing moves performed by pressing a pair of face buttons.</p><p dir="ltr">Redline was fierce and swift, taking down groups of four or more enemies at a time with regularity. I could also use a trigger button to spray-paint enemies huddled around me, much like Batman's cap stun attack. The paint would stick to the enemies and the environment, giving it a nice visual touch in which you literally left your mark on a brawl. I could shoot whenever I wanted to, but it's not a shooter. The guns were best used as combo finishers, which you can see stylish examples of in the trailer above.</p><p dir="ltr">While the game won't necessarily be "easy," it's not meant to send you beating your head into a wall. With people's busy schedules in mind, a developer told me the studio wants players to be able to play for just a short while and feel like they've made progress. If you come home from work and only have a little time to play games, you should be able to load up Spine, crack a few skulls, and feel like you've accomplished something in your short timeframe. And for players who do want more of a challenge, the game will offer a mode in which you have to avoid taking any damage <em>at all</em>. Good luck with that.</p><p dir="ltr">I liked Sifu, but more on the merits of its art direction, story, and, sure, how good the combat looked when I could pull it off. But Spine made me feel just as powerful without the accompanying frustrations, and personally, I'm way more up for that kind of experience. Whereas some games of this sort leave me feeling like a nameless goon at times, Spine made me feel like one of Keanu Reeves' punchiest roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Spine comes to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>
