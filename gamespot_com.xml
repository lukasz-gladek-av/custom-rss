                <p>A free-to-play title called PirateFi was released with little fanfare on Steam earlier this month. But the only reason many players will ever hear about it is because the game has been pulled from the platform for spreading malicious malware to unsuspecting gamers who downloaded it.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/did-you-download-this-steam-game-sorry-its-windows-malware" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Magazine</a>, Valve has been notifying players who downloaded PirateFi about the takedown. In the screenshot reproduced below from SteamDB, Valve encourages PirateFi players to run a full-system scan with anti-virus software. The company also suggests considering a full reformat of players' operating system in order to remove any malicious programs that may linger.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1889610974484705314" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A game called PirateFi released on Steam last week and it contained malware. Valve have removed the game two days ago.<br>Users that played the game have received the following email: <a href="https://t.co/B98BFs0WbK" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/B98BFs0WbK</a></p>  â€” SteamDB (@SteamDB) <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1889610974484705314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>It's unclear how many players' computers were infected by PirateFi. Although SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3476470/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only lists five players at PirateFi's peak</a>, users on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3476470/?curator_clanid=4777282" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam's board</a> indicated that the game wouldn't launch. If that's the case, then most of those users wouldn't show up as active players on SteamDB. PC Magazine notes that there was a job offer on Telegram for an in-game chat moderator for PirateFi, and the user who shared that story believes that the game developer's account was run by an AI program.</p><p>Steam recently released a survey that revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/almost-half-of-steam-users-still-use-windows-10-despite-impending-end-of-life/1100-6529522/" data-ref-id="1100-6529522">almost half of Steam's users are still using Windows 10</a> despite the operating system's impending support shutdown this fall. Additionally, it appears that Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-seemingly-bans-all-steam-games-that-require-watching-advertisements-to-play/1100-6529356/" data-ref-id="1100-6529356">has banned games on Steam that force users to watch ads</a> to play them.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> has required a $15 monthly subscription to play since its launch back in 2004, but in all those years, the price in the US has never gone up. According to ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, it was due to not wanting to "agitate" the game's playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick reflected on his long history as the CEO of Activision and later Activision Blizzard. Along the way he dove into details about developer Blizzard and WoW's success.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="3483">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D2urSgcuyyo?start=3483" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">He said the game over its lifetime has seen over 150 million subscribers, making it the "best subscription business of all time." When one of the interviewers suggested the price of the subscription could have been "priced more highly" given WoW's huge success, Kotick pushed back against the idea.</p><p dir="ltr">"We never raised the price," Kotick said. "My view was we come up with value-added services, come up with new things to sell, but just leave the price. We could figure out how to come up with other things to sell them. And it's a prickly audience, you know? You don't wanna do too much to agitate them. And even a dollar increase would've been a problem in my view."</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick went on to talk about how vital Blizzard veteran Chris Metzen was to the company's success, and said he was, and still is, "the soul of creativity at the company." Metzen retired from Blizzard in 2016 (according to Kotick, due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">burnout related to the Warcraft movie</a>) but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-veteran-chris-metzen-is-once-again-working-on-warcraft/1100-6510092/" data-ref-id="1100-6510092">returned in 2022 as a creative advisor on WoW</a>. He is now an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-chris-metzen-is-now-shaping-the-future-of-warcraft-as-a-creative-director/1100-6518000/" data-ref-id="1100-6518000">executive creative director for the Warcraft universe</a>. Prior to returning to Blizzard, Kotick said Metzen believed WoW's upcoming expansions were in bad shape, and Kotick "begged him" to return in order to fix them.</p><p dir="ltr">"Just come do it, you're the guy, come do it," Kotick said he told Metzen.</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick said Metzen had his "fingerprints" all over the MMORPG's latest expansion, The War Within, and that the next expansion, under Metzen's guidance, "is going to be great." Once Metzen returned to Blizzard, Kotick said he hardly ever talked with him, instead preferring to let him get to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?" Kotick said. "I just wanted him to do his thing."</p><p dir="ltr">Kotick served as CEO of Activision, and later Activision Blizzard, from 1991-2023, stepping down after the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-officially-acquires-activision-nearly-two-years-later-bobby-kotick-resi/1100-6516016/" data-ref-id="1100-6516016">publisher's sale to Microsoft for $69 billion</a>, which came after a variety of controversies involving the publisher.</p>

                <p>Windows 11 has been here for a while, but that doesn't mean that Windows 10 users are willing to go gentle into that good night, despite its impending "end-of-life" date of October 14, 2025. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcguide.com/news/nearly-half-of-steams-users-are-still-using-windows-10-with-end-of-life-fast-approaching/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Guide</a>, according to Steam's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/" rel="nofollow ">January 2025 Hardware &amp; Software Survey</a>, more than 44% of the storefront's users are still on Windows 10, with more than 55% opting for Windows 11.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows 11 has been out for four years now, but there are a few obvious reasons for its lack of market penetration. For one, the differences between Windows 10 and Windows 11 can be difficult to suss out at a first glance, and for most users, there isn't really a strong reason to upgrade. For another, Windows 11 came along with some stiff hardware requirements that essentially locked out those with older processors, even though many of those machines can still run many PCs games well.</p><p dir="ltr">Windows 10's end of life means that Microsoft will no longer receive software updates or security fixes, and the company has been encouraging users to upgrade for years now. It seems inevitable that the numbers will begin to shift a bit more, a process that has perhaps already started--Windows 10 had a slight majority of Steam's userbase in September of last year, losing roughly 5% in the interim. The survey also revealed that the most popular GPU for Steam users is the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, that 16 GB RAM is the most common, and that a majority of Steam users have hard drives with more than 1 TB total space and 100 to 249 GB of free space.
