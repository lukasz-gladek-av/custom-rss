                <p dir="ltr">The Like a Dragon--previously called Yakuza--video game series has been around for nearly 20 years, but it's never been more popular in the West than it is today thanks to Yakuza: Like a Dragon and its 2024 sequel Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. It figures to move even more into the mainstream with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Yakuza-Season-Trailer/dp/B0D9PPR5FY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV series</a> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Video</a> today, October 24. In honor of the new TV series, several retailers are holding sales on the entire Yakuza series, making now the perfect time to get into the beloved Japanese crime saga. You'll find deals on console and PC versions of the games, including an Amazon discount that drops the most recent game, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a></strong>, to just $30 (normally $70).</p><p dir="ltr">This nearly 60%-off deal is the best price we've seen for Infinite Wealth since its release earlier this year. The discount applies to the PS5, PS4, Xbox (cross-gen) versions of the game, but it's only available for a limited time, so grab it while you can. As mentioned, Infinite Wealth is a direct sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which starts a new story arc with a brand-new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Like a Dragon is a great game to start with if you're new to franchise. Infinite Wealth continues Kasuga's story and brings back Kazuma Kiryu, the original protagonist of the Yakuza series.</p><p dir="ltr">Like a Dragon's PS4 physical edition, which has a free upgrade for PS5 players, is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Q6HT9J9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $15 at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1857376942411315089%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyakuza-games-are-on-sale-for-cheap-in-celebration-of-new-prime-video-series%2F1100-6527384%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next seasonal celebration, the Halloween-themed Festival of the Lost, will offer new ways to get some highly sought-after rewards. The annual event is bringing a means to get its best piece of armor, the ability-combining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-exotic-class-items-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-how-they-work/1100-6523922/" data-ref-id="1100-6523922">Exotic class item</a>, that allows you to skip <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">the (excellent, but potentially arduous) two-player Dual Destiny mission</a>. The Festival of the Lost will also see the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack</a>, an all-black cosmetic shader players haven't been able to get in the game since the launch of the Final Shape expansion.</p><p>Bungie laid out the details for how to get both rewards in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>, where it also provided a bunch of information about the Festival of the Lost event, which launches on October 29. During the Festival, players can earn an event-specific currency--candy, because it's Halloween--that can be spent with Eva, the vendor for holiday events. With 2,500 candy and one of the Festival's specific gear drops, an Eerie Engram, you can buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva.</p><p>Currently, players need to complete Dual Destiny, a two-player story mission, located in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location that was added with The Final Shape. It's one of Bungie's best missions, in fact, but some players have struggled with or complained about its requirements. Dual Destiny can't be completed alone, and because it requires a lot of communication and teamwork in the same way Destiny 2's raids and dungeons do, the mission doesn't support matchmaking. Thus, if you don't have a good teammate with whom you can communicate to complete the mission with, you can't unlock the Exotic class item.</p><p>Buying the class item from Eva gives players a new route around Dual Destiny to get the item, although there are some caveats. First, you still need to own The Final Shape in order to get a class item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390101" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390101"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 Exotic class item for Hunters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg"></figure><p>Exotic class items carry two special perks, which are drawn from other Exotic armor pieces, which allows players to combine those abilities to create special new builds. Those perks are assigned randomly, and you can buy as many class items as you want to try to get the combination of perks you're looking for. However, if you <em>do</em> complete Dual Destiny, you can unlock the ability to "attune" the class items you buy from Eva to get the specific rolls you want. So players who haven't completed the mission can still buy random Exotic class items from the vendor, but they can only get random rolls, not attuned ones.</p><p>Alongside the class items, the Festival of the Lost will also offer an opportunity for players to earn Superblack, possibly the best shader in the game, or at least the most requested. To get it, you'll need to really lean into the Festival of the Lost, though. The shader is the reward for the Ghost Writer event challenge, which requires you to complete 15 event challenges. Those are the special Triumphs that are part of the Festival's Event Card, so they're likely to require a lot of participation in the Festival.</p><p>Shaders recolor weapons and armor and usually several different colors and textures based on a specific theme, but Superblack stands apart because it's the only all-black shader in the game. Superblack was first released in the original Destiny, but it wasn't a part of Destiny 2 until Into the Light, the event that Bungie released ahead of The Final Shape. If you completed a lengthy list of objectives as part of Into the Light, Superblack was your reward--but when Into the Light ended ahead of The Final Shape's release, Superblack went with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390102" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390102"></a><figcaption>Superblack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg"></figure><p>This is the first time Superblack has been back on the menu for players. Unlike with the Exotic class item, though, you can get Superblack as a free-to-play Destiny player. The Festival of the Lost itself is also free.</p><p>The Festival of the Lost doesn't sound like it's changing too much from previous years, requiring players to take on different haunted Lost Sectors to defeat bosses and earn candy, usually while wearing Festival of the Lost-specific masks. The event is adding seven more masks this year, as well as Arcane Embrace, a shotgun with a new special archetype that fires two shots in quick succession.

The best map for getting started, especially for beginners, is the Liberty Falls map. Here we'll explain how to gain access to the Pack-a-Punch machine, as well as the costs associated with those upgrades for your weapons.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find and unlock the Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch</h2><p dir="ltr">When starting a match on Liberty Falls, the Pack-a-Punch machine will be on the opposite end of the gas station rooftop where you'll spawn. This will take some time to earn enough points to access the area you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also more than one path you can take, with doors to unlock on the left and right side of your starting area, but we recommend choosing the right side. This will give you quicker access to the most essential perks of Juggernog and Quick Revive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067" data-ratio="0.56277056277056" data-width="1848" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls cemetery barrier </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 1:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spend the 1,500 essence points needed to unlock the right-side barrier.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 2: </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Head behind Ollie's Comic Shop to unlock the second barrier needed. This is 1,750 essence points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 3:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Follow the street leading up the hill to the church. This will include a barrier for 2,000 essence points to unlock access to the church front and cemetery.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 4:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The front entrance to the church is also locked, so it will cost you 2,250 essence points to open this final barrier to the church.</p><p dir="ltr">You can now enter and find the Pack-a-Punch machine at the back of the room.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also helpful to note that Black Ops 6 finally <strong>allows players to share the costs of opening doors</strong>. You can choose to pay a portion of the barrier costs, and other teammates can chip in as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Pack-a-Punch costs</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390069"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390069-libertyfallspap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Upgrading the power of your weapon with the Pack-a-Punch machine is a hefty price. There are three tiers of upgrades, which are priced as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Tier 1 costs 5,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 2 costs 15,000 essence points</li><li dir="ltr">Tier 3 costs 30,000 essence points</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Playing solo, you should be able to unlock access to Pack-a-Punch and get a tier-one upgrade by level 9.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390065"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls Arsenal machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390065-libertyfallsarsenal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also upgrade your weapon's rarity by adding more attachments. This rarity upgrade is applied at any of the map's Arsenal machines. There's an Arsenal machine at the end of the street on the right side, which is just beyond where you open the first barrier. There's another Arsenal machine in the parking lot opposite the church.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades are paid for with the salvage currency dropped by fallen zombies. The costs are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">500 for Common (Green)</li><li dir="ltr">1,000 for Rare (Blue)</li><li dir="ltr">3,500 for Epic (Pink)</li><li dir="ltr">8,500 for Legendary (Orange)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out all the details on how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-progression-and-prestige-works-plus-tons-of-unlocks-and-rewards/1100-6527292/">player progression and prestige work</a>.
