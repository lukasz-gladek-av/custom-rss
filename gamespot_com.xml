                <p dir="ltr">Nearly 25 years from its initial release on the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee continues to be one of the most popular games in the platform fighting franchise, particularly in the modding community. One modder, Mooshies, decided to add one of gaming's newest icons to the battle: Jimbo from Balatro.</p><p dir="ltr">The jolly jester's Smash Bros. Melee variant is a reskin of Mr. Game and Watch, with all of the movements and attacks of Mr. G+W intact. However, Mooshies's mod replaces all of the original character's weapons and sound effects with cards, images, and sounds from the 2024 smash hit roguelike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QjT-WGHvoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9QjT-WGHvoM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mooshies released a brief gameplay trailer showing Jimbo in action, along with the wild and wacky way he uses the recognizable jokers and card packs from Balatro in matches against Falco, Marth, and more. This was originally released as a paid mod, but Melee players interested in trying Jimbo out can find the mod on <a href="http://patreon.com/Mooshies" rel="nofollow ">Mooshies's Patreon page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Smash Bros. community has been bereft of new content across the entire series since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's final update in 2021, which saw Sora from Kingdom Hearts join the roster as the final downloadable fighter in SSBU's Fighter Pack 2. Other downloadable fighters added to Smash Bros. Ultimate as DLC include Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII, Steve and Alex from Minecraft, and Kazuya from Tekken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Super Smash Bros. may be dormant, its creator, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, has been keeping busy. His next project, Kirby Air Riders, launches November 20 on Nintendo Switch 2, and it was the focus of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/">45-minute Nintendo Direct</a> earlier this month.</p>

                <p>Ysbryd Games has officially announced the delay of Demonschool's release, shifting its launch date from September 3 to November 19. The decision, described as one made with "anguished consideration," comes in response to an unexpectedly competitive release window, headlined by the announcement of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-finally-revealed-after-years-of-waiting/1100-6534159/" data-ref-id="1100-6534159">Hollow Knight: Silksong's September 4 debut</a>--and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">not the first game delayed because of the surprise release</a>.</p><p>This surprise timing left the indie publisher little choice but to reconsider. "Crueler still," noted the press release, written by founder Brian Kwek, "that we should find out with such short notice that Hollow Knight: Silksong will launch just one day after our planned release for Demonschool."</p><p>The publisher emphasized the difficult nature of launching a title in 2025 due to the early fall season being increasingly crowded, with other major titles such as the Final Fantasy Tactics remaster, Pokemon Legends: Z-A, and Ghost of Yotei launching within weeks of each other. For those unfamiliar, Demonschool is a new-style tactics RPG with some clear Persona influence sprinkled in.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fazy1L9KXFQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fazy1L9KXFQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"If the September period is going to be Silksong's moment, then we need to be elsewhere on the calendar to give Demonschool its own moment to be seen and talked about meaningfully," the statement continued, adding "there are no more delays after this point." The delay also enables the inclusion of additional content at launch, including alternate endings and minigames that were originally slated for post-release updates.</p><p>Demonschool will be available for all current major platforms, including PC via Steam. Ysbryd and developer Necrosoft Games expressed its gratitude to fans for their continued patience and enthusiasm. "We truly hope you continue to support Necrosoft Games' labor of love by showing up for Faye and her madcap band of collegiate demon hunters on November 19th," concluded Kwek.</p><p>"This was not our choice, but we understand why the choice was made. We aren't mad at Ysbryd but at the situation. Dropping the GTA of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out," Necrosoft Games said in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3lxak6xi3622r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bluesky post</a>. "Ysbryd is being a good partner and paying for the delay. We're sorry this is happening." Ironically, a release date had been anticipated for quite some time, and the original September launch date was committed to only a few weeks ago.</p>

                <p>In 2024, Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">shut down its live-service shooter Concord after only two weeks</a>, as it became one the publisher's most prominent failures. According to Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive of studio business Hermen Hulst, the biggest lesson from Concord was that more oversight is needed during the development process.</p><p>"We have since put in place much more rigorous and more frequent testing in very many different ways," Hulst told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d5859ffc-c4d7-4480-98a6-c1cff07af299" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a>. "The advantage of every failure ... is that people now understand how necessary that [oversight] is."</p><p>Hulst went on to explain that he wants Sony's PlayStation studios to make big swings when conceiving future franchises. However, he would also like to catch the failures before they launch.</p><p>"I don't want teams to always play it safe," noted Hulst. "But I would like for us, when we fail, to fail early and cheaply."</p><p>Following Concord's demise, Sony subsequently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">re-committed to live-service titles</a>. Regarding future titles in that genre, Hulst downplayed the importance of how many live-service games are available and said, "What is important to me is having a diverse set of player experiences and a set of communities."</p><p>One of Sony's next live-service launches is slated to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marathon/" data-ref-id="5000-589442">Marathon</a>, the new game by Bungie. That title has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/give-marathon-a-chance-former-concord-developer-says/1100-6530862/" data-ref-id="1100-6530862">already drawn unfavorable comparisons to Concord</a>, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">was delayed indefinitely in June</a>. Since then, reports have emerged that Bungie is losing its independence to PlayStation Studios. Last week, Bungie's longtime boss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/longtime-bungie-boss-pete-parsons-announces-departure-after-two-decades/1100-6534197/" data-ref-id="1100-6534197">Pete Parsons announced his departure</a> from the company after two decades.</p><p>Marathon is expected <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-exec-expects-marathon-to-launch-by-march-31-says-bungies-independence-is-getting-lighter/1100-6533759/" data-ref-id="1100-6533759">to be released before the end of Sony's fiscal year</a>, which runs through March 31, 2026.</p>

Speaking to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pitchford-nervous-challenge-borderlands-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Pitchford said there are many Borderlands players who aren't looking for much challenge out of their experience, and parts of the game might test them like the franchise has not before.</p><p>"We have lots of players that actually aren't interested in deep, hard challenges; lots of people that love just exploring the Borderlands or spending time with the characters," Pitchford said. "I'm a little nervous because there are points of Borderlands 4 that are more challenging."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The executive went on to say that if any players are struggling, they can "just grind somewhere" and level up their character to become more powerful to help them get past where they are stuck.</p><p>"You will find that things that were hard when you were a little chump will become trivial when you become a badass," Pitchford said. "But we definitely have pushed the challenges quite a lot, especially with bosses and boss fight mechanics."</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches on September 12 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. It comes to Switch 2 on October 3. In other news, Pitchford has said he expects the game to succeed and push the entire Borderlands franchise <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-will-push-franchise-beyond-100-million-sales-gearbox-ceo-says/1100-6534199/" data-ref-id="1100-6534199">above 100 million units.</a></p><p>"We went from an industry that predicted that we would die--that Borderlands would find no audience--to being one of the leading video game franchises in the world. And it's kind of humbling, frankly, to be a part of it," Pitchford told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/gearbox-boss-randy-pitchford-says-the-game-industry-once-expected-a-genre-experiment-like-borderlands-to-die-but-it-actually-became-one-of-the-leading-video-game-franchises-in-the-world-its-kind-of-humbling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar.</a></p><p>A major point of online discussion about Borderlands 4 has been its price--which is $70. Pitchford said the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">delivers so much value that it would still be worth it if 2K charged $350.</a></p>
