                <p>As part of Konami's Tokyo Game Show briefing today, the company <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/18845/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater's Fox Hunt multiplayer mode will launch on October 30.</p><p>Fox Hunt, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/" data-ref-id="1100-6532384">which was previously announced</a>, is an evolution of Metal Gear Online. The mode puts players into "cat-and-mouse encounters" as players must sneak around and survive.</p><p>Fox Hunt supports online matches with up to 12 players, and there will be two modes. The first of these is called Survival Capture, and it's described as a "tense, multi-phase mission" where players must capture Kerotan frogs. The number of frogs decreases as the match continues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xGBiC4K9ME" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xGBiC4K9ME" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The second mode is called Survival Intrude and it has players attempting to capture and hold zones, with the number of zones decreasing as the match plays out.</p><p>Players deploy with an AT-CAMO suit that allows them to camouflage themselves in different environments to blend in. Players also get an ability called Naked Sense, which detects nearby enemies and items.</p><p>Fox Hunt does not support cross-platform multiplayer, but players can creative private matches with friends on the same platform. Fox Hunt does not include any microtransactions.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/" data-ref-id="1900-6418396">Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater review</a> scored the game a 9/10. "It successfully modernizes visuals, tweaks game design, and updates controls so that the game sits comfortably alongside its action game contemporaries," reviewer Tamoor Hussain said.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid: Delta Snake Eater is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Metal+Gear+Solid+Delta%27s+Fox+Hunt+Mode+Launching+In+October%2C+No+Microtransactions+Or+Cross-Play&amp;fnauthor=eddienoteddy&amp;fndate=2025-09-25+06%3A03%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-25+06%3A32%3A27&amp;fnarticle_id=6535016&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.fanatical.com%252Fen%252Fgame%252Fmetal-gear-solid-d-snake-eater&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmetal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-mode-launching-in-october-no-microtransactions-or-cross-play%2F1100-6535016%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently on sale at GameSpot sister site Fanatical.</a></p>
