                <p dir="ltr">These days Call of Duty is filled with outlandish shop bundles, including animal-themed operators, neon-colorful outfits, and characters like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. However, a wacky new operator bundle in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a> is causing controversy, as some players are calling the bundle's emote a sneaky pay-to-win tactic.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the latest shop items in Call of Duty is the Cardboard Commando bundle. This includes an operator constructed out of cardboard boxes, and everything in the bundle is themed around cardboard, too. The controversy comes from the bundle's "Surprise Gift" emote, which allows you to turn into a cardboard box mid-game.</p><p dir="ltr">The emote can be seen in the clip above, as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1916567772387070072" rel="nofollow ">ModernWarzone</a>, and several comments on the video are already calling the emote a pay-to-win feature.</p><p dir="ltr">Being able to quickly conceal yourself in Call of Duty can be quite the advantage, especially in more competitive modes like Search and Destroy or Warzone's battle royale. This cardboard box is fairly large and should look out of place in most settings. The emote also only temporarily lets you disguise yourself as a box. So, while this paid emote could potentially give you a competitive edge over your opponents, it's unlikely to fool anyone who isn't a new player. Still, this is a 2,400 CoD Points ($20) bundle that probably shouldn't let you hide.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty recently had another pay-to-win bundle controversy with the game's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-include-nerf-for-terminator-skin/1100-6530740/">Terminator skin has been adjusted</a> to include better visibility, but it was a very minor visual change.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/youll-never-guess-who-the-next-cod-operator-might-be/1100-6531191/">Seth Rogan may become a future Call of Duty operator</a> as part of the stoner-themed content arriving with the Season 3 Reloaded update. Here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-reloaded-start-date-and-details/1100-6531027/">major announcements for Season 3 Reloaded</a>, including a new weapon, Ranked Play for Warzone, and more multiplayer maps.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a> amped up its production last November, though it won't launch until at least 2027. We know that it will continue the story of the previous games, albeit with Ciri now serving as the series' protagonist, and that former hero Geralt (and his long-time voice actor, Doug Cockle) will still be around in some capacity. However, the voice artist behind The Witcher 3's Yennefer of Vengerberg has said she doesn't know yet if her character will return for the upcoming sequel.</p><p>Denise Gough, who now stars in the Star Wars series Andor as Imperial Officer Dedra Meero, wasn't sure if Yennefer would return, much less the level of progress of the game.</p><p>"I don't know any of this," Gough told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yennefer-voice-artist-doesnt-yet-know-if-shes-back-for-the-witcher-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. She also looked back at her initial signing on for the role and was confused by the process.</p><p>"I didn't know what I was doing," Gough continued. "I'd never done a video game before. And then lots of, usually men, would come up to me in sound departments on film sets, would come up and go [whispers] 'are you Yennefer?' And I was like 'who's Yennefer?'"</p><p>The sorceress Yennefer is part of The Witcher's main character trinity, along with Ciri and Geralt. Her 'complex' relationship with Geralt, is featured in numerous Witcher stories as well as a prominent part of Netflix's The Witcher TV adaptation. In the series, she is played by actress Anya Chalotra.</p><p>Fans got their first proper look at Liam Hemsworth in the role of Geralt back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">in May last year</a>. The Witcher Season 4 production started a year ago, with Netflix announcing that the series will end with Season 5. The final two seasons will adapt the events from The Witcher books, Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake.</p>
