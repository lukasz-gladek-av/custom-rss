                <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has further detailed its plan to break apart or be sold. In a news release today, the media giant that owns the developers of Mortal Kombat, Batman, and Harry Potter games said it has received "unsolicited interest" from multiple parties already to acquire the entirety of the company or just Warner Bros.</p><p>These parties were not named outright, but <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg recently reported</a> that Paramount submitted a $20/share bid for WBD, which the company rejected. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/wbd-sale-warner-bros-media.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC reported</a> that Netflix and Comcast might be in the mix, too. Netflix already is invested in the gaming space and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">continues to ramp up its efforts</a> after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">some previous setbacks. </a></p><p>WBD said its board will "evaluate a broad range of strategic options" moving forward as it relates to the company's previously announced plan to sell the entire company or break it up in multiple sales or spin-offs.</p><p>CEO David Zaslav said he's trying to find a buyer or multiple buyers to help "unlock the full value of our assets." WBD board of directors chair Samuel A. Di Piazza Jr. added, "We continue to believe that our planned separation to create two distinct, leading media companies will create compelling value," but that it's important as well to "broaden" the scope of potential transactions to find a deal that pays the company the most possible money for its assets.</p><p>WBD did not set a deadline or a timetable for when it will complete this newest strategic review for these "strategic alternatives" to the previously announced separation plan. That plan, meanwhile, is booked to be completed by mid-2026, if it happens at all.</p><p>Also today, WBD announced <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-max-prices-increases-plans-2025-1236557671/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another price hike for HBO Max, and it's the third in three years.</a> WBD's stock price is soaring today, up more than 10% so far.</p><p>As for WBD's gaming efforts, the company has said it will focus on core franchises going forward with the highest potential of making money back. Batman: Arkham Knight developer Rocksteady is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">working on a new single-player Batman game</a>. WB Games Montreal is reportedly pitching a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/" data-ref-id="1100-6529314">new Game of Thrones title</a>. Avalanche Software is expected to be working on a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285"> full sequel</a> to Hogwarts Legacy. The Mortal Kombat series, meanwhile, is expected to continue from developer NetherRealm. As for other DC projects, studio boss James Gunn has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">some "really interesting" projects are coming</a>, but not soon.</p><p>One we do know about is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-691445">Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>, which launches in 2026 from developer Traveller's Tales. As for the Mortal Kombat series, Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection is coming October 30, but it's published by Atari, not Warner Bros. A project that is not coming to market is Wonder Woman, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">WBD canceled the game and closed the studio, Monolith.</a> The company also closed Player First Games and WB San Diego earlier this year.</p><p>WBD management said the breakout success of Hogwarts Legacy gives the company the confidence that it can "get back to producing high-quality games built for long-term consumer engagement." The company said it expects its video game division to return to profitability in 2025 with the games division looking to become a "more significant contributor to growth in the years ahead."</p><p>WB's longtime gaming boss, David Haddad, announced in January that he is leaving the company but will stay on for the time being to help with the transition process.</p>

                <p>Lovecraftian survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/">The Sinking City 2</a> has been delayed to 2026, as Frogwares says that the ongoing war in Ukraine and its ambitious design goals for the sequel will have necessitated more development time. While a concrete release date hasn't been set yet, the studio says it is aiming to have the game out in the first half of 2026.</p><p>"Developing a game during a war isnâ€™t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning."</p><p>Lead game designer Alexander Gresko also added that The Sinking City's 2 shift toward a full-fledged survival-horror direction has also slowed the team down, as it has to learn a "completely different kind of design thinking" for the game. To make up for the delay, the studio revealed 13 new screenshots for The Sinking City 2, showing off more of the game's setting and enemies that players will encounter. Frogwares also plans to reveal a fresh look at the game soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

                <p>A new report has shed light on Electronic Arts' use of AI, revealing a company that's implementing the technology in everything from game development to performance reviews. EA's position? Employees should view AI as a "thought partner."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report from Business Insider</a>, EA's top brass over the past year has urged its nearly 15,000 workers to use AI for everything from coding and concept art to scripting conversations around performance reviews and promotions. Internal documents Business Insider obtained showed some workers are not just expected to take multiple AI training courses, but also use AI daily to expedite work, with the idea that the tech is a "thought partner."</p><p>The company's in-house chatbot, ReefGPT, is one of the tools EA is pushing onto its workers. However, people Business Insider spoke to on the condition of anonymity said this chatbot produces flawed code and other hallucinations, creating more work that clogs production. Other people Business Insider spoke to said EA is expecting creative staff to train AI on their work, instilling a fear that the company may then facilitate a downsizing that could cut talent such as artists and level designers.</p><p>A laid-off Respawn Entertainment senior quality-assurance designer told Business Insider that AI basically did his job--reviewing and summarizing playtesters' feedback--which is why he believes he was cut from EA this spring, along with nearly 100 others.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">EA warned of "legal and reputational" risks</a> around the industry's mass adoption of AI, saying consumers could "lose confidence in our business and brands" if the technology isn't managed appropriately.</p><p>The company was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased (pending regulatory approval) by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">one of the largest sales in the business sector</a> that--much like EA's AI use--raises some ethical questions.</p>

                <p>Silent Hill has once again cemented itself as one of the biggest survival-horror franchises, thanks to critically acclaimed releases like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake in 2024 and the recent launch of Silent Hill F. Both games--and an interactive streaming series called Silent Hill Townfall--were first announced in a 2022 livestream, and series producer Motoi Okamoto recently spoke about how this was a deliberate move on Konami's part to show fans of the franchise that it was committed to reviving Silent Hill.</p><p>"Three years ago, in 2022, we announced three titles--Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, and Silent Hill: Townfall," Okamoto said in a <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979174851308032466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a> (via an <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-series-producer-says-publishers-cant-expect-players-to-get-serious-about-an-ip-with-just-remakes/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> translation). "We didn't want to just announce a single remake to 'test the waters.' We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series. Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen."</p>

<p>Okamoto added that players would not feel motivated to give a new game in a long-running series a chance if the company behind it was adopting a "wait-and-see" approach, and only by approaching the IP with a serious intent could it get the fanbase for that game to engage with it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/">Silent Hill F</a> have been critically acclaimed entries in the franchise, and there's still more to come.
