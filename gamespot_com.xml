                <p>Similar to The Sims, the in-game Zois in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529953/" data-ref-id="1100-6529953">InZoi</a> can die if you don't take care of them or if they suffer an accident. It's now come to light that the game has 16 unique types of death, including dying from a need for recognition. During the recent InZoi showcase event, InZoi game director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim confirmed that a significant element of the game is death, and the game will include numerous ways to bite the dust.</p><p>"In InZoi we have a lot of different types of death, because life comes with death. In InZoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," he said, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by PC Gamer</a>. "And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful."</p><p>Another way to die in InZoi is getting hit by a car, "so you might want to be careful around cars," Kjun said. When InZoi launches, players can enable driveable cars from the menu as part of an experimental test, but otherwise, cars drive automatically.</p><p>Beyond all of these, InZoi will include a method of dying that Kjun said has never been in a game before, and that is "dying from the need for recognition."</p><p>"In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognized by others and this death reflects that," the director said.</p><p>As an example, Kjun said the game might present an opportunity to have a fight with someone that causes a rumor to spread--and the consequences could be deadly. "I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down. And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that," Kjun said.</p><p>Announced previously, InZoi also has a reputation system that allows for Zois who die with a bad reputation to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzois-game-director-teases-plans-for-ghost-zois-getting-shackled-to-the-mortal-realm-karma-starved-and-seeking-redemption-if-they-die-with-a-bad-rep/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">come back as ghosts to haunt the living</a>.</p><p>InZoi releases on Steam Early Access on March 28, priced at $40. The game will receive a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-price-and-update-roadmap-revealed-just-before-launch/1100-6530201/" data-ref-id="1100-6530201"> range of free updates</a> as part of a post-launch DLC roadmap.</p>

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has generated more than five times as much money during its first month on the market compared to its predecessor's debut in 2018.</p><p>That's according to the analyst firm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lkqai5tjhs2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana</a>. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was released on February 4 and was the second-best-selling game on console this past month behind Monster Hunter Wilds, which launched on February 28.

                <p dir="ltr">Typing with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-controller/1100-6473486/">an Xbox controller</a> on Windows 11--especially handheld devices--should become easier with a new update rolling out. That's because Microsoft is bringing controller functionality found on Xbox Series X|S for keyboards to Windows 11.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632342/microsoft-windows-11-gamepad-keyboard-xbox-controller-available-now" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> reports all Windows 11 users should see the new Xbox controller feature in the coming weeks. Not only will there be a gamepad-specific layout for touch keyboards, but there will be controller shortcuts too, such as pressing X for backspace or Y for space. This should sound familiar to Xbox console owners when typing on the system. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3613-to-the-release-preview-channel/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft's official language</a> for the update is below:</p><p dir="ltr">"We have enabled the gamepad keyboard layout for the touch keyboard in Windows 11. This change introduces the ability to use your Xbox controller to navigate and type. This includes button accelerators (example: X button for backspace, Y button for spacebar) additionally the keyboard keys have been vertically aligned for better controller navigation patterns."</p><p dir="ltr">Considering this controller support works with Windows 11 mobile devices, this could add fuel to the fire about a recent report saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">an Xbox-branded handheld is planned to release later this year</a>. Microsoft is possibly partnering with Asus on the device, which would run Windows and sport Xbox aesthetics. Additionally, Microsoft is apparently also internally developing an Xbox handheld that's eyeing a 2027 launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-is-an-intriguing-idea-to-phil-spencer/1100-6522161/">Phil Spencer has talked about an Xbox handheld</a> for a while now, even noting he wants current PC handhelds "to feel like an Xbox." That also parallels <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">a marketing push to remind people that Xbox is more than just a singular console</a>.</p>

As a reward, a video of Hazelight founder Josef Fares congratulates the viewer and admits that many in their office can't beat the level. He also invited the first fans to complete Laser Hell to the studio's headquarters in Sweden to see Hazelight's next game, which is still in development. Fares later congratulated sharkOvO and E1uM4y on social media and confirmed that they had earned their trip before promising to reach out.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/1902355744751514068" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Congrats to ”sharkOvO” and ”E1uM4y” for finishing the secret challenge ”Laser Hell” in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/splitficton?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#splitficton</a>.

As warlords vie for control, it's up to you to aid Yasuke and Naoe, to see how their destinies are intertwined. One is a samurai, a peerless warrior who can go toe to toe against multiple foes. The other, meanwhile, is a shinobi, striking from the darkness to silently eliminate her targets.
