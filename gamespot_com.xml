                <p>The makers of an upcoming spaceship co-op title are making a slight change of course: The game formerly known as Jump Ship has been renamed to Jump Space.</p><p>Development studio Keepsake Games announced the name change in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam post</a>, assuring readers that the rebranding does not affect the game's release plans, and adding that a date announcement for its early access launch is coming this month at Gamescom. The title's Steam listing currently displays a release window of Q3 2025.</p><p>The studio, which was formed by veterans from Mojang, Hazelight Studios, and Coffee Stain Studios, stated that the new name is the result of "trademark complications." Keepsake's post does not go into detail about the complications. "Jump ship" is a fairly common idiom, but any company or product sharing the name could be the reason for a trademark dispute.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨IMPORTANT NEWS!🚨<br>We're renaming to Jump Space, due to trademark complications.<br>This does not affect our release plans -<br>In fact, RELEASE DATE REVEAL at Gamescom later this August! <a href="https://t.co/x2iouYlvmV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/x2iouYlvmV</a></p>  — Jump Space - formerly Jump Ship (@KeepsakeGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1952730057832821071?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Regardless, Keepsake expressed excitement for the name change. "We think Jump Space is super cool, after all, there is more to the game than just the Ship," the Steam post continues. Funnily enough, this isn't the first name change for the game, as it previously<a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1663878368696193031" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> went by the codename Hyperspace</a> before a formal reveal as Jump Ship in 2024.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jump-ship-looks-like-ftl-combined-with-sea-of-thieves/1100-6522368/" data-ref-id="1100-6522368">Jump Space has four players</a> act as crew members on a spacefaring craft, taking on several "hand crafted missions with random elements." Players will switch between operating and maintaining the ship, space walking, and exploring planets on foot.</p><p>Common points of comparison to Jump Space include Left 4 Dead and Sea of Thieves, and it joins the budding "space Sea of Thieves-like" subgenre alongside Void Crew and Wildgate. However, Jump Space is purely a PvE experience, bringing it closer to Void Crew and less like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-space-pvp-game-wildgate-will-be-supported-after-launch/1100-6533150/" data-ref-id="1100-6533150">PvP-focused Wildgate</a>.</p><p>According to Keepsake Games, over 1 million people have added Jump Space to their Steam wishlist. The game is running a closed beta, and a free demo was available for a limited time this past June as a part of Steam Next Fest. Keepsake says that the Next Fest demo reached over 500,000 players.</p>
