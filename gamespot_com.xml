                <p>Arc Raiders is a popular gaming, and it could become a movie or TV show next.</p><p>Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderlund told <a href="https://x.com/deantak/status/2008263228313464868" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesBeat</a> (<a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/arc-raiders-movie-tv-offers/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VideoGamer</a>) that the team has received numerous offers from Hollywood, but nothing has materialized as of yet. "It needs to be done in the right way," he said.</p><p>"I can't tell you how many companies have reached out wanting to make a TV series [and] movie out of this IP," he said. Soderlund added that it would be "fun" to see Arc Raiders get adapted for a film or TV show, but nothing is officially in the works as of yet.</p><p>"The IP fits quite well," he said of Arc Raiders.</p><p>Arc Raiders launched in October 2025, sandwiched between Battlefield 6 and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. It has enjoyed great success, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">reportedly selling 12 million copies and driving more than $350 million in revenue</a>. Months after release, Arc Raiders recently had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">biggest day ever.</a> The game also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/steams-2025-game-of-the-year-revealed-plus-all-other-winners/2900-7383/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7383">won the Most Innovative Gameplay award for the Steam Awards.</a></p><p>If Arc Raiders gets a movie or TV show deal, that doesn't mean anything would ever actually be produced. After all, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/video-game-movies-in-the-works/2900-5059/" data-ref-id="2900-5059">50+ video game adaptations in some form of development at the moment</a>, and it's not expected that they will all be seen through to release.</p><p>In terms of video games movies that are definitely coming, 2026 will see the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-plot-release-date-and-everything-we-know/1100-6536141/" data-ref-id="1100-6536141">The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/street-fighter-movie-release-date-cast-and-everything-we-know-so-far/2900-6770/" data-ref-id="2900-6770">new Street Fighter film</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-release-date-moved-up-but-not-by-much/1100-6535603/" data-ref-id="1100-6535603">next Mortal Kombat movie,</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-director-says-he-is-following-the-rules-but-also-telling-a-new-story/1100-6534939/" data-ref-id="1100-6534939">Resident Evil movie from Weapons director Zach Cregger</a>.

                <p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 developer Warhorse has revealed one feature that it cut from the RPG because it was too weird and not very fun.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nearly-had-a-san-andreas-like-fat-henry-system-that-would-have-let-you-create-bohemias-chunkiest-boy-and-forced-you-to-wear-clothes-that-fit-to-boot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, executive producer Martin Klima said this feature was a <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Eating" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GTA: San Andreas-like eating system</a> where main character Henry could gain and lose weight depending on food consumption. This would also affect what Henry would be able to wear.</p><p>The version of Kingdom Come 2 that launched in February 2025 allows players to put on any piece of clothing they find. But it wasn't always this way. In earlier stages of development, Klima said, "Some NPCs would be fat and some would be thin, and then the clothing they wear would be either too large or too small for you."</p><p>If players found a piece of clothing or armor that was too big for them, they would be able to eat a bunch of food to grow in size. Alternatively, players could cut back on chowing down to shrink into smaller clothes. "When you eat, basically, you would get fatter, and then this clothing you have in your inventory suddenly <em>will</em> fit you, while the clothing you had previously wouldn't fit you, because now you're too fat for it. Or you could go on a diet and do the same process in reverse," Klima said.</p><p>In the end, the feature didn't make it into the game for a few different reasons. "It was just really too bizarre and too much work and not really that much fun," Klima said. "We felt that the clothing system is quite complex as it is, and it really doesn't need another layer of complexity."</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 is on sale for just $30 right now on Amazon.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come 2 review</a> scored the game a 9/10. Reviewer Richard Wakeling said it is a "triumphant sequel, improving upon its predecessor with an open-world RPG that delights in its complexity and emphasis on player choice."</p><p>Kingdom Come 2 was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-best-pc-games-of-2025/2900-7326/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7326">among GameSpot's favorite PC games of 2025.</a></p>

A report said it had been in some stage of development since 2018 and that it might have been a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">cross between Cyberpunk 2077 and Destiny</a>.</p><p>Following the game's cancellation and layoffs at the studio, some affected workers started new studios, including the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-elder-scrolls-online-devs-behind-canceled-mmo-project-blackbird-game-launch-a-new-studio/1100-6535321/" data-ref-id="1100-6535321">employee-owned Sackbird Studios.</a></p><p>"After years in AAA, we wanted the freedom to take smart risks without waiting for a greenlight or chasing quarterly targets," CEO Lee Ridout said about the formation of the new studio.</p><p>After working at ZeniMax for 18+ years, Firor is now "advising some projects and start-ups," he wrote on LinkedIn. He also said he has "made some investments in small teams...." Some have wondered if Firor may start a new studio, but he said he has "not yet seriously contemplated" this.</p><p>The cancellation of Project Blackbird came as part of wider cuts at Xbox. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#11" data-ref-id="2900-6726">Rare's Everwild was also canceled</a>, as was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/#11" data-ref-id="2900-6726">new Perfect Dark from The Initiative</a>--the studio was also closed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why Clair Obscur Expedition 33 Is GameSpot's Game of the Year 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Many are derived from French, the home country of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 developer Sandfall Interactive. For example, the Machinapieds enemy is simply "Machine with feet" in French, while the Licorne enemy is French for unicorn. Some enemies are a combination of French words or a wordplay on French phrases. Barbasucette is a combination of the French words for beard and lollipop, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Other names are based on what that particular enemy does. The Potier is French for potter, since that enemy throws pots, while the flying Volster enemies are derived from Vol, the French word for fly. The rolling ball-shaped Petank enemies are named after the French boules game Petanque.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some names that don't fit into those categories and are more one-off references. The Gestral Ono Puncho is a reference to the popular anime and manga series One-Punch Man, while another, Limonsol, is labeled in the files as an "inside joke" with no additional context.</p><p dir="ltr">As for why Sandfall Interactive went out of its way to link Wikipedia articles and explain the meaning behind all the game's names within its files, fans are theorizing it was done for the benefit of localization teams in order to help convey the meaning behind characters into different languages.</p><p dir="ltr">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 ended 2025 with a bang, with one <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-getting-a-free-update-with-new-boss-battles/1100-6535296/" data-ref-id="1100-6535296">final free update adding new boss fights</a> amidst the game taking home a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">record-shattering number of awards</a>, including Game of the Year, at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">2025's The Game Awards</a>. It was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's 2025 Game of the Year</a>. The game's runaway success even saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/president-of-france-takes-a-turn-congratulating-clair-obscur-expedition-33/1100-6536961/" data-ref-id="1100-6536961">French President Emmanuel Macron</a> congratulate Sandfall Interactive for its work.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Sandfall's next game, it's unclear if it will be a sequel of sorts to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, with the game's director having previously confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-is-the-franchise-name-says-sandfall-as-it-stays-coy-on-what-comes-after-expedition-33/1100-6534302/" data-ref-id="1100-6534302">Clair Obscur is the name of a "franchise"</a> and that Expedition 33 is merely one story within it. The studio knows expectations are now high for whatever comes next, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dev-doesnt-just-want-to-be-people-pleaser-with-next-game/1100-6537165/" data-ref-id="1100-6537165">doesn't want its next game to be a "people-pleaser,"</a> according to Sandfall lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen.</p>

                <p>Awesome Games Done Quick (AGDQ), a bi-annual charity livestream, kicked off this week with an assortment of speedrunners playing new and old games, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/jet-set-radio-2000/" data-ref-id="5000-134083">Jet Set Radio</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" data-ref-id="5000-538251">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. A wacky event that tends to attract all sorts of characters, someone made a surprise appearance during AGDQ on January 5: Pac-Man, who played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pac-man-world-2/" data-ref-id="5000-3987">Pac-Man World 2</a>.</p><p>Well, it wasn't really Pac-Man. The day started with speedruns of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-x/" data-ref-id="5000-966">Final Fantasy X</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mega-man-battle-network/" data-ref-id="5000-3197">Mega Man Battle Network</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nuclear-throne/" data-ref-id="5000-198784">Nuclear Throne</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wolfenstein-the-old-blood/" data-ref-id="5000-403573">Wolfenstein: The Old Blood</a>. As the multi-hour livestream went on, the event's organizers booted up Pac-Man World 2 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> content creator DThaiPome to play. If the event raised $10,000, then Pac-Man--really, DThaiPome in a blow-up Pac-Man costume--would speedrun his own game. That fundraising goal was easily crushed, and DThaiPome, in a Pac-Man outfit, played some Pac-Man.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wl0fD-h9mM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wl0fD-h9mM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Playing a remastered version of the classic 2002 platformer, DThaiPome managed to beat Pac-Man World 2 in approximately 30 minutes, employing all kinds of skips and tricks to get to the end as quickly as possible.</p><p>AGDQ started on Monday, January 4 and runs until Sunday, January 11.

                <p dir="ltr">As GPU prices continue to skyrocket and stock becomes increasingly scarce, rumors are swirling that Nvidia might be about to resurrect a previously discontinued line of hardware.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/" rel="nofollow ">Wccftech</a>, Nvidia is reportedly on the verge of resuming production on its budget-friendly GeForce RTX 3060 GPUs to combat the ongoing shortage of RAM being caused by an uptick in development on AI technologies and the increasing prices of memory.</p><p dir="ltr">Wccftech's reporting on these rumors seems to stem from a credible leaker of Nvidia GPU production news on Twitter called <a href="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@hongxing2020</a>. According to a post they made early on January 5, Nvidia seems poised to bring back the RTX 3060 in the first quarter of 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060 Q1 come back… 🥲</p>  — hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The back half of 2025 saw GPU prices sharply rise as tech companies voted to go all in on AI. In short, many of these companies need more raw computing power, which means that companies like Nvidia are now dedicating massive amounts of their own consumer stock to these ends. What little is left for consumers looking to build PCs has now risen in value, and you've likely seen as much if you've spent the last few months shopping around for the right parts for a gaming PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Just days into 2026, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amd-and-nvidia-will-reportedly-raise-gpu-prices-significantly-in-2026" rel="nofollow ">reported</a> that both AMD and Nvidia , two of the most reputable names in the business, would be raising the prices of their consumer GPUs quite heavily this year. Some of the estimates being floated sound <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/memory-crisis/" rel="nofollow ">preposterous</a>, but regardless, you better get used to the idea of paying a lot of money--more than usual, at least--for memory as we wade deeper into 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, unless the rumors prove true and Nvidia does really bring back the RTX 3060, which is still one of the most<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> popular graphics cards</a> around despite being phased out for the newer (and more expensive) 40 and 50 series GPUs.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-4/" data-ref-id="5000-565525">Resident Evil 4 Remake's</a> opening moments could have played out much differently if Capcom had not opted to cut an opening referred to as "Chapter 0," in which players would have controlled Ashley and witnessed her kidnapping at the hands of the Los Illuminados. At least, that's according to datamined files spotted by an eagle-eyed fan.</p><p dir="ltr">Using leftover pieces from "Chapter 0" found in the game's files, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thekempy</a> has pieced together what the game's lost opening might have looked like in a recent video. Players would have controlled Ashley alone in a forest at night as she encountered a Los Illuminados ritual, something which can actually be briefly seen in a story trailer for the game released in October 2022.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXI-MrzgZXU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After witnessing the sacrifice, Ashley would have made her way to the center of the game's village, potentially having to use the light of her phone to navigate and sneak past deadly enemies like the Ganado. Her running would become more frantic as the chapter continued, eventually witnessing a Ganado kidnapping another character, Luis Serra.</p><p dir="ltr">While the cutscenes for the cut chapter aren't found in the Resident Evil 4 remake's files, there are some leftover enemy spawn locations, scripted events triggers, auto-save locations, and even off-limit areas that help give an idea of what the chapter would have looked like.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear why this opening chapter, something that doesn't exist in the original Resident Evil 4, was cut prior to launch. Thekempy speculates Capcom's decision may have been related to pacing, as an opening chapter focusing on Ashley hiding and sneaking would have slowed down a game known for its non-stop action.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom is far from finished remaking Resident Evil games. Reports have indicated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-are-the-next-remakes-for-the-franchise-report/1100-6523753/" data-ref-id="1100-6523753">remakes of Resident Evil Zero and Code Veronica</a> may be coming in the next few years, with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-resident-evil-0-remake-will-flesh-out-originals-story-report/1100-6535568/" data-ref-id="1100-6535568">Resident Evil 0 remake reportedly looking to further flesh out</a> characters and plot details only alluded to in the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, will bring back <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leon-kennedy-is-back-in-resident-evil-requiem-and-now-he-has-a-chainsaw/1100-6536786/" data-ref-id="1100-6536786">Resident Evil 4's Leon S.

                <p>Steam hit a major milestone already this year, setting a new record for concurrent users. According to SteamDB, the platform peaked at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">41,816,052 users online at the same time</a> actively playing games. Not only that, but a new record for actively gaming users was also set, with that figure reaching <a href="https://mein-mmo.de/en/steam-starts-in-2026-in-the-best-way-already-breaking-a-record-after-4-days,1544545/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">almost 13.4 million</a> as compared to March's 13.2 million record.</p><p>The timing of the record is likely no coincidence.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-winter-sale-2025-game-deals/2900-7360/#g2a_2025_1694524" data-ref-id="2900-7360"> Steam's annual Winter Sale</a>, which wraps up later today, offered steep discounts on a wide range of popular titles, along with more modest deals on newer releases. Sales events have long been a reliable driver of traffic on Steam, pulling in both longtime users and players returning to pick up games they missed throughout the year.</p><p>Steam's growth has been steady for well over a decade, but it has accelerated sharply in recent years. A notable spike occurred in early 2020, when COVID-19 lockdowns pushed concurrent users past 23 million, later climbing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-passes-28-million-concurrent-users-setting-new-record/1100-6499464/" data-ref-id="1100-6499464">28 million just a couple of years later</a>. The company even offered a bundle of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-covid-19-bundle-has-4-fantastic-indie-games-/1100-6475753/" data-ref-id="1100-6475753">which went to COVID relief at the time</a>. Since then, the rise of live-service games and consistently strong seasonal sales have helped keep players logged in, especially during holidays. Games like Arc Riders continue to grow, hitting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">over 3 million concurrent players this week</a>.</p><p>While Steam reached this new peak after nearly 17 years of expansion, the pace of growth has been especially fast over the past six years, with peak user counts nearly doubling in that time. The achievement comes during a mixed period for Valve, which has faced criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-horses-ban-reflects-the-gaming-industrys-double-standards-and-emotional-immaturity/1100-6537012/" data-ref-id="1100-6537012">inconsistent content moderation and censorship decisions</a>.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see how these numbers change <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">once the Steam Machine comes into play</a> later this year.</p>
