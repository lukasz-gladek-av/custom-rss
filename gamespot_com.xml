                <p>The time has come and 210 days after the initial service was supposed to shutter, Nintendo's 3DS and Wii U online servers are officially gone. The service lasted as long as it did due to the efforts of dedicated fans around the world. One final player was left by the end, with a system crash finally bringing the end of 3DS online play.</p><p>Player Fishguy6564 wasn't the only player to keep going until the curtain call, but he was certainly the most successful in terms of how long he managed to keep things going. "It's over. Rest in peace, Nintendo Network," Fishguy6564 tweeted Sunday morning along with showing his 3DS displaying an error message.</p><p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/after-127-days-in-nintendo-server-purgatory-the-last-known-mario-kart-3ds-survivor-thinks-he-cant-be-stopped-this-could-go-on-forever/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar back in August</a>, Fishguy6564 said that he could potentially keep playing forever with the only caveat being "if the 3DS somehow gave in." Sadly, that was the foretold ending.</p><p>Fishguy wasn't the only player keeping the tracks alive. He and another fellow player, Marioiscool246, set off with a clear goal: Keep a lobby alive for as long as possible. They did this by installing a patch that "supposedly prevented the death of a lobby" by deploying two bots to race each other endlessly.</p><p>After Marioiscool246's 3DS crashed in May, Fishguy6564 kept going for almost seven months. Even back in August, he couldn't believe it lasted that long. "It sure has been a wild ride," he added.</p>

                <p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard studio BioWare has now seemingly "shifted entirely" to the next Mass Effect. As such, the studio is apparently not planning any downloadable expansions for The Veilguard.</p><p>BioWare confirmed these details in an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/dragon-age-the-veilguard-john-epler-interview-1235147001/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, though there were no direct quotes from the team attesting to this or offering any other details. Dragon Age: Inquisition, for comparison, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-inquisition/dlc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">welcomed eight total expansion packs after launch</a>, spread across single-player and multiplayer.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">previous report from Bloomberg</a>, developers working on the next Mass Effect were pulled off the project to assist with getting The Veilguard out the door. Staffers from Iron Man studio Motive were also re-assigned to The Veilguard to help finalize the game for release, the report said.</p><p>BioWare creative director John Epler didn't reveal any new information about the next Mass Effect in the interview, but he discussed the possibility of BioWare trying its hand again at multiplayer. The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">originally had a live-service design before getting rebooted as a single-player game</a>. It remains to be seen what could happen for the next Mass Effect, but Epler said he loves the "focus that single-player can give you."</p><p>"It's possible to tell a strong story in a multiplayer game. Final Fantasy XIV does an excellent job," he said. "Multiplayer also introduces some complications around world states. I make a giant choice in my world, and the world changes."</p><p>The Veilguard launched on October 31 and enjoyed the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-biowares-biggest-launch-ever-on-steam/1100-6527529/" data-ref-id="1100-6527529">best-ever debut for a BioWare game on Steam</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1845910/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reaching 89,000+ peak concurrent users.</a></p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard review in progress</a> scored the game a 7/10. If you're just getting into the game, you might want to check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-veilguard-guides-hub/1100-6527490/" data-ref-id="1100-6527490">The Veilguard guides hub.</a></p><p>As for the Mass Effect series, BioWare is currently at work on the next entry in the spacefaring series. It remains to be seen when more information about the game could be revealed, but some are predicting news could come as soon as this week. That's because the Mass Effect holiday--N7 Day--takes place this Thursday, November 7. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>
