This makes for a fast-paced game focused on combat and exploration that's easy to set up and learn, but still offers much of the customization, continuity, and replayability of pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The game originally launched in 1989 and was out of print for several years until it returned with the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HeroQuest-Tabletop-Immersive-Fantasy-Adventure/dp/B08Q4J1XHZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HeroQuest Game System (2nd Edition)</a></strong>, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. You can pick up a copy for $91.60 at Amazon, which is very close to the lowest price this year. Though the retailer briefly sold it for under $50 in early 2024, the price has trended up ever since--it hasn't dropped below $85 since Black Friday. The price has bounced between $90 and $110 throughout 2025 (so far). HeroQuest's MSRP is $135.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a cheaper path to accessing the new expansion.

While you can play Nightreign as a solo player, the game is focused on pairing you with two other players for you all to fight and explore together. Fortunately, both the single-player and multiplayer functions in Elden Ring Nightreign are easy to use, allowing you to minimize your time between expeditions into the Living Lands.</p><p>Below, we'll show you everything you need to know about how to start expeditions and how to set up both single-player and co-op multiplayer runs in Elden Ring Nightreign, as well as the lack of proper cross-play support.</p><h2 id="How_to_start_expeditions_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to start expeditions in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, let's go over how to actually get into expeditions once you're past the tutorial of the game that occurs within the first 10 or so minutes.</p><p>After the tutorial, you'll find yourself at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a>, a familiar location for Elden Ring fans. At the Roundtable Hold, you can interact with a variety of NPCs, but the main area you'll spend the majority of your time in is right in the center at the table itself. When you approach the central table, you'll get a prompt to "Commence Expedition," which you want to press.</p><p>When you choose to commence an expedition, the boss menu in Nightreign will appear on your screen. This lists all the current bosses you can hunt down in the game, providing a brief background on each one so you know what you're up against.

You can do the same things, fight the same enemies, and try to defeat all of the bosses to eventually reach the final boss. Of course, as a solo player, this is incredibly hard, and once you die a single time, you're dead for good since you can't be revived.</p><h2 id="How_to_play_multiplayer_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to play multiplayer in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now, let's get into playing Elden Ring Nightreign the way the developers intended. By default, your Expedition Type is set to multiplayer, so if you want to play with two random players, all you have to do is commence an expedition, pick your boss, and then the game will take care of the rest. You'll be automatically matched with two other real players, and then the character selection screen will appear.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498401"></a><figcaption>The tutorial box for setting up team expeditions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498401-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.39.18.46.png"></figure><p>Only one person can select any particular class, so if a player gets to your favorite class, you need to have a backup or two. Once the characters have been chosen, all three of you will drop onto a map together, and you can start playing from there. There's no limit to staying near your teammates, so feel free to do whatever you think is best. However, you'll eventually wind up with your teammates at the end of the day as the zone encroaches around the map.</p><p>On the flip side, if you want to play with your friends instead of random players, you can do that from the Matchmaking Settings menu as well. All you have to do is select the "Invite Members" option from the menu, which brings up a list of your online friends from your platform. If you invite players, they become members of your party, and you can all hop into an expedition when everyone has readied up. As a note, <strong>if some players haven't progressed to your point in the game, they'll still be able to play, but could experience content they haven't seen yet</strong>.</p><p>To bypass the inviting and joining process, you can also set a multiplayer password. This allows you to matchmake with players using the same password as you, which gives you the chance to play with people that you're not friends with on your platform. You can choose to set the number of players with the password who can join, with a maximum of three players, which fills out the entire party. If you select one or two players, then the remaining spots will be filled with random players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png" data-ref-id="1300-4498402"></a><figcaption>Setting a multiplayer password for others to join off</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4498402-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-23.44.16.18.png"></figure><p>Finally, you can also set up to five group passwords. These passwords are so you can more easily see bloodstains, phantoms, and victor records from others who are using the same password. Of course, setting up five passwords takes some coordination if you're planning to use them across a large friend group, so make sure all of your friends are using the exact passwords.</p><h2 id="Does_Elden_Ring_Nightreign_support_cross_play_">Does Elden Ring Nightreign support cross-play?</h2><p>Now that you understand how multiplayer expeditions work, you might be wondering if you're able to party up with your friends or other players who are on a different system. Unfortunately, Elden Ring Nightreign does not support cross-play at launch, meaning that you can only matchmake with players who are on the same system as you.</p><p>However, there is one caveat to that rule. Nightreign does support cross-generation play, which means you can party up with friends and players who are using the same console brand as you. For example, if you're on Xbox Series X|S, a friend on Xbox One can still matchmake with you for an expedition. The same goes for players on PlayStation 4 and 5.</p><p>So, while the game doesn't offer full cross-play, there is a silver lining for those who have a friend group with some mismatched last-generation and current-generation consoles.</p><p>And that just about does it for all of the ways to set up an expedition in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p>

She's a self-sufficient magic caster who can maintain her own FP without using items and whose spell choice determines what additional abilities she can use.

Magic Cocktail is the most important part of the Recluse's skillset, as it restores her FP <em>and</em> gives her access to a broad variety of offensive and support spells, from fiery explosions to auras that raise everyone's maximum HP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_Cocktail_and_Elemental_Defense"><strong>Magic Cocktail and Elemental Defense</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This is the Recluse's standard art. Use it when an elemental stain is present to absorb that element and recover FP. The Recluse stores three elemental stains, and when she uses Magic Cocktail with three stains, she casts a new spell that changes depending on the stored elements used. Magic Cocktail has no cooldown timer, and you need to use it regularly to restore the Recluse's FP so she can keep casting spells.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Soulblood_Song"><strong>Soulblood Song</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Soulblood Song is the Recluse's ultimate art. She attaches blood sigils to all nearby foes and deals magic damage to them. Allies--including the Recluse--who attack enemies with blood sigils will restore their HP and FP by a small amount with each attack.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Magic_dodge"><strong>Magic dodge</strong></h3><ul><li dir="ltr">This isn't a named ability, but the Recluse's dodge has a slightly longer window of evasion compared to the standard dodge the other Nightfarers get.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The most important thing about Magic Cocktail, aside from learning its combos, is that the Recluse can absorb elemental stains from sources other than her own spells. If, for example, a teammate has a fire bow and attacks an enemy with it, it'll create a fire stain you can absorb.</p><p dir="ltr">The Recluse begins an expedition with a single weapon, the Recluse's Staff. It's a basic sorcery staff that lets her cast Glintstone Pebble, which is good for single targets, and Glintstone Arc, which can hit groups of enemies and potentially knock them backward. It's a humble set of spells, but the fully upgraded versions still make a dent in the HP bar of strong enemies.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Magic_Cocktail_combos">All Magic Cocktail combos</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502324" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502324"></a><figcaption>Every combo benefits the party, even if some of them don't deal damage.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502324-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The number of stacks is irrelevant except in cases where we specify otherwise. For example, the floating fireball spell works whether you have two fire and one standard or two standard and one fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Another point worth keeping in mind is that, like with other spells, Recluse combos take a second or two to cast. Make sure you have a safe space to cast them in, without a boss bearing down on you.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Three standard: Creates a swirl of magic that damages enemies at intervals</li><li dir="ltr">Three fire: Launches a spiralling bolt of fire at a target that explodes on impact.

Our guide for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-incantations-and-magic-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531836/" data-ref-id="1100-6531836">where to find magic and Incantations</a> has specifics about where to look.</p><p dir="ltr">The ideal scenario is one where you find lightning, fire, and holy spells, so you have the full range of Magic Cocktail combinations available to use. The easiest-to-use ones are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Flame Sling</li><li dir="ltr">Lightning Spear</li><li dir="ltr">Discus of Light</li></ul><p dir="ltr">All three have comparatively short casting times, and you can charge them for extra damage. Zamoor Ice Storm is another powerful sorcery, though it's rare, and you can end up with good results from any of the dragon communion Incantations. The drawback with using those is how long they take to cast and how difficult it is to target quick enemies with them. The best time to use a dragon breath Incantation is while a boss is immobile during a critical hit or if their attention is occupied elsewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't find the spells you want, it's worth keeping one or two weapons with elemental affiliations on hand. The Recluse isn't built for using greatswords and hammers, but a twinblade, dagger, whip, or sword with a useful affinity lets you use a wider variety of Magic Cocktail's combos even without magic.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_relics_for_Recluse">Best relics for Recluse</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502326"></a><figcaption>Spells have lengthy cast times, so make sure you have enough space between you and your target to cast them safely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502326-elden-ring-nightreign-recluse-guide-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Like with weapons, the random nature of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">finding relics</a> makes it challenging to recommend a combination that might be useful to anyone.

Some have negative effects that make the fight more challenging than it needs to be, such as giving Libra greater damage resistance or reviving the boss after defeat. Others are less problematic.

The only difference as you deplete this boss' health is that Libra starts using certain attacks more frequently, such as the clouds of madness, or makes them faster and more powerful, like with their madness sigils.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Staff_smash">Staff smash</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Libra performs a three-hit staff combo--two horizontal strikes, followed by a powerful overhead slam. The overhead attack has a slightly longer delay. Libra may use variations of this pattern, with multiple horizontal strikes before using the overhead smash</li><li dir="ltr">Dodge toward Libra to evade all three and give yourself a little extra time to land a hit, if you're on the offensive</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Rotating_madness_sigil">Rotating madness sigil</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Libra summons a single sigil that fires a beam of madness-infused energy.

The clouds rain down madness after a few seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Libra also uses a weaker version of this attack with three bursts of madness rain in a smaller range</li><li dir="ltr">Retreat away from Libra so you aren't under the clouds or rain</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Madness_sigils">Madness sigils</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Libra summons large sigils that appear under you and, after a few seconds, explode with madness-infused energy.

Once Libra finishes chanting, your madness meter maxes out, and you take extensive damage</li><li dir="ltr">Interrupt Libra with an ultimate art.

These cleanse a small amount of madness and let you survive the final burst</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Frenzied_shield">Frenzied shield</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Libra creates a sphere of energy around itself. If uninterrupted, Libra completes the shield, causes a small explosion, and takes less damage while the shield lasts. If you break it, Libra enters a frenzied state with double attack speed</li><li dir="ltr">If you've got a good grasp on Libra's patterns already, it's often worth just dealing with the shield's increased damage resistance instead of having to put up with a relentless barrage of attacks. If you feel up to it, though, shatter the shield with an ultimate art, such as the Ironeye's or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-wylder-class-guide/1100-6531893/" data-ref-id="1100-6531893">Wylder</a>'s. Extended uses of dragon breath Incantations can also break the shield, though the Recluse is usually the only one with an FP pool large enough to pull it off</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Libra_weaknesses">Libra weaknesses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502816" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502816"></a><figcaption>Collect the orange crystals scattered around the arena to stave off madness.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502816-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The boss-selection menu tells you that Libra deals madness damage and is also weak to madness damage. While we never saw evidence that Libra suffers from the madness affliction like other enemies do--where they suffer extra damage after a period of buildup--it's true that the boss takes extra damage from madness weapons and spells.</p><p dir="ltr">Those are hard to find, though, and you might have more than a few runs without a madness camp showing up on the map. If so, or if the weapons you get from a madness camp don't suit your build, Libra is also prone to frostbite and blood loss. Ice weapons and spells, katanas, daggers with bleed effects, or, if you're lucky, a bow with the bloodloss effect, are all suitable choices.</p><p dir="ltr">By Day 2, if you don't have any weapons that take your fancy, spend time getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">Smithing Stone 2 in Limveld's mines</a>. That way, you can upgrade whatever weapons you <em>are</em> using and dish out plenty of damage, even if you can't exploit Libra's weaknesses.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_team_combinations_for_Libra">Best team combinations for Libra</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502817" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502817"></a><figcaption>An ally with an offensive ultimate art can shatter Libra's shield before it finishes charging.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4502817-elden-ring-nightreign-libra-boss-5.jpg"></figure><ul><li dir="ltr">Three Ironeye</li><li dir="ltr">Two Ironeye, one Raider, Duchess, or Wylder</li><li dir="ltr">One Ironeye, one Recluse, one Wylder or Raider</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Libra moves quickly, but often targets just single teammate or uses close-range attacks. You want at least one ranged character who can maintain pressure while the beast is targeting a teammate or while you're out of their attack range. The other necessary component for this fight is an ultimate art that damages enemies--so, the Wylder, Ironeye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guardian-class-guide/1100-6531894/" data-ref-id="1100-6531894">Guardian</a>, or Raider. At several points during the fight, Libra will start to generate a shell that, if left unbroken, increases the boss's resistance to all attacks for several minutes. The Executor's ultimate is useful, but often not powerful enough to break the shell before it forms.</p><p dir="ltr">Ironeye is the best choice, since they're less reliant on lucky item drops and can still dish out quite a lot of damage just by upgrading their standard bow. One hit from their ultimate is also enough to shatter Libra's shell before it forms. The Recluse is also useful--doubly so if you manage to nab a madness-related spell or Incantation--though their reliance on item drops for stronger Magic Cocktail spells means you might get stuck with just Glintstone Pebble for the fight.</p><p dir="ltr">The Duchess is another worthwhile consideration. Her ultimate deals no damage, but her extra dodge and longer evasion window makes it easier to avoid Libra's staff strikes and escape from madness sigils before they activate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for some extra support, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-guides-hub/1100-6531889/" data-ref-id="1100-6531889">Elden Ring Nightreign guides hub</a> which includes the best ways to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-best-ways-to-farm-runes/1100-6531844/" data-ref-id="1100-6531844">farm runes</a>, where to find <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-smithing-stones-and-upgrade-weapons-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531840/" data-ref-id="1100-6531840">smithing stones</a> to upgrade weapons, and how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">increase healing flask charges</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> matchmaking isn't as simple as pressing a button and letting the game take care of everything. That's especially true if you're looking to tackle specific fights against the Night Lords, or want to play with people from other regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">how to play solo and multiplayer</a>, there are a few matchmaking rules that aren't explained in too much detail. If you're only getting your bearings around the game, the process might lead to some frustrations. Fear not, though, as we'll explain everything you need to know about how matchmaking works in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Elden Ring Nightreign matchmaking works</h2><p dir="ltr">At its core, matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightregin is fairly straightforward. Interacting with the Table of Lost Grace at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">Roundtable Hold</a> opens up the Expeditions menu. From there, you can select which boss you want to tackle and immediately start matchmaking, which will search for two other available players who are on the same hunt as you are.</p><p dir="ltr">If you've enabled the cross-region network option, you might be matched with people from, well, other regions. I'm based in Argentina, and I've primarily played with people from the United States, but latency was rarely an issue.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, here's where matchmaking in Elden Ring Nightreign gets tricky: The first available Night Lord is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. You won't gain access to other bosses until you've beaten it at least once. As such, if you want to matchmake with people who have other Night Lords unlocked, you'll first need to tackle that requirement. This <em>can</em> be bypassed if you're matchmaking through specific platforms' party invites, but it won't apply to random matchmaking with players outside your friends list.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502861"></a><figcaption>A party of Nightfarers arrives on day 1 in Limveld.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4502861-eldenringnightreign_20250519220916.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shifting Earth events are another condition. These are random instances that affect maps in an array of ways, which also become available after defeating our pal Tricephalos. Now, these are in rotation, and there are a few different conditions to unlock them all. You can matchmake with people who have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-shifting-earth-events-guide/1100-6531879/" data-ref-id="1100-6531879">Shifting Earth event</a> active, even if you don't, but you must have encountered it at least once before.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, there are also Character Remembrances. These lore snippets, which are different for each playable class, lead to unique objectives on your next expedition. If you have one active, you won't be able to matchmake with other players who also have an active objective. Once again, you can bypass this step by inviting folks through your platform's party system. If you do, only the first person to start the matchmaking process will have their objective on the map.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, if you're matchmaking with friends in Elden Ring Nightreign, you'll largely be able to join each other's games without too many hurdles. When trying to find matches with random people, however, it might be tricky. At the very least, the more progress you make, the easier this will become.

In short, this is a deadly rain that gradually engulfs the map, closing in on a random area where a boss fight takes place. This happens at the end of Day 1 and Day 2--after the latter, you'll automatically move to a different area outside Limveld, where you'll do your last preparations before confronting the Night Lord chosen for the expedition.</p><p dir="ltr">Each day lasts for around 15 minutes. During that time, you'll notice how the blue circle outside of the map gradually shrinks.

                <p>When you first get past the tutorial in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, you'll be able to challenge a single boss: the Tricephalos. This is the only boss that you can select from the Expeditions menu, regardless of whether you decide to run a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-solo-and-co-op-explained/1100-6531697/" data-ref-id="1100-6531697">solo or multiplayer expedition</a>. If you manage to make it through your first two nights, you'll get to challenge Tricephalos, which goes by the name "Gladius, Beast of the Night" when you get to the boss arena.</p><p>If you don't want to die to Gladius and make your expedition run all for nothing, then check out our guide below for tips on how to beat the first boss in Elden Ring Nightreign.</p><h2>Gladius, Beast of the Night attacks</h2><p>Gladius, Beast of the Night is a three-headed dog--or Tricephalos-- with several primary attacks that you'll always need to be on the lookout for and a couple of major attacks that can decimate your entire party at any moment. It specializes in fire damage, so that's worth keeping in mind for your resistances and counters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503372" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503372"></a><figcaption>The opening scene with Gladius, Beast of the Night</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503372-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.22.48.93.png"></figure><p>When your party first heads into the boss arena, Gladius will usually start with its chain attack, where it will uncoil a large whip-like chain from over its head and fire it quickly in a curved line. This attack always targets a single player, but can be initially avoided if you see that the boss is targeting you. However, you need to watch out for the chain's secondary attack, which whips the chain across the arena and damages anyone who's in its way.</p><p>After the chain attack is over, Gladius will recall the chain and often start moving around the arena to find a specific player to target with close-range attacks. If the boss doesn't do that, though, it will likely use its sword attack, which is another medium- to long-range move that targets one player. The sword attack is similar to the chain, but the sword moves in a straighter line and at a faster speed. It's easy to predict which player the boss targets with the sword, but you need to be quick to dodge the sword once Gladius swings it at you if you're the one it's targeting.</p><p>Those are the two set attacks that Gladius performs with the weapons at its disposal. Of course, Gladius also has attacks that involve melee or using one of its three heads. In between the chain and sword attacks, the boss will target one player and move towards them to try and bite them, lift up its paws to do a stomp move, or swing its tail around to damage any nearby players.</p><p>After you have dealt enough damage to Gladius it will unleash its primal form, which involves the boss splitting up into three separate dogs. Each one of these dogs remains large, but only one has a sword that it can use. However, the entire boss arena will be covered in banners that deal area of effect damage throughout this phase, so you want to ensure you're staying far away from the floating orange structures.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503373"></a><figcaption>The primal form of Gladius litters the arena with dangerous banners.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503373-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.24.24.91.png"></figure><p>You need to deal enough damage to each of the three dogs during this phase for Gladius to return to its normal, three-headed self. Every time Gladius returns to its regular form, you can expect the same attacks as when the fight began. So it's crucial you know the timing and predictability of the chain and sword attacks.</p><h2>Strategies for Gladius, Beast of the Night</h2><p>Now that we've gone into the attacks you can expect from Gladius, what are some strategies you and your party can utilize to defeat the boss?</p><p>First off, it's highly recommended not to try this boss solo, as the three dog phase alone will usually be enough to overwhelm a single player. Going in with a full three-person party is the best way to defeat Gladius, and there's really no "perfect" party combination to use. However, if you want to see some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">efficient party combinations in Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, check out our other guide.</p><p>Assuming you are in a full party of three, the best opening strategy for Gladius is to have one dedicated player be the "aggro" target for the boss. This player should ideally be running a tanky melee class like the Raider or Wylder, and their job is to consistently grab the attention of Gladius when it's not performing one of its set attacks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503374" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503374"></a><figcaption>Splitting up your party's three members is a great strategy for Gladius</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503374-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.23.08.77.png"></figure><p>When Gladius is focused on this single player, the other two party members can attack it from range or up close, depending on their chosen classes. The aggro target player can also try to attack, but their primary job is to dodge Gladius' attacks to stay healthy and keep the boss focused on them. Whenever Gladius moves to try to attack another player, the aggro target needs to attack the boss to make it refocus on them.</p><p>To effectively deal damage to Gladius, all players need to use their abilities to their fullest extent. Taking larger chunks away from the boss's bar using abilities and perhaps some equipment is the best way to make this fight go by faster. Of course, abilities aren't always available to use, so the players who Gladius isn't focused on need to try and deal consistent damage using their top weapon(s) while the boss is distracted and not using one of its better attacks.</p><p>The players Gladius isn't targeting can also try to support the aggro target. This can be done using Warming Stones in the aggro target's range, which heal any character standing in its range, or utilizing their own abilities if the player gets into trouble. For example, the Raider class can summon a large pillar as its ultimate ability, and that can be used quite effectively to save a player who is low on HP or needs to be revived faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503375" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503375"></a><figcaption>The first Night Lord Felled screen in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4503375-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.27.31.81.png"></figure><p>Unfortunately, a bulk of this strategy goes out the window during Gladius' three dog phase. During this phase, it's best for each player to try to manage one of the three dogs so that the dogs aren't all grouping up on one player, which can lead to a vicious revive cycle. Of course, if one or two players are low on HP, then it might be better to all group up and try to survive the phase together so that one player doesn't take the brunt of the damage.</p><p>All in all, Gladius can be a tricky boss to deal with in Elden Ring Nightreign. It has some powerful attacks, a difficult phase that can be triggered multiple times, and a ton of HP that doesn't go down easily. However, as long as your party members are dealing consistent damage, splitting up when necessary, and helping out different players, you should be able to defeat the boss on your first or second try.</p><p>If you managed to defeat the Tricephalos in Elden Ring Nightreign, why not take a look at our other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-equilibrious-beast-libra-boss-guide/1100-6531874/" data-ref-id="1100-6531874">boss guide for the Equilibrious Beast</a>, which is unlocked after defeating Gladius.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Deep Rock Galactic celebrated its 5-year anniversary in May 2025. Below, we look at how it has maintained its identity as one of the best co-op shooters around.</em></p><p>Before any round of Deep Rock Galactic, my friends and I have a little ritual. We'll pile into the bar at HQ and order a drink. Sometimes, it'll be Deep Rock's equivalent of a seasonal draft--complete with buffs that'll carry over into the next few expeditions--but other times it's just a brew with a silly effect, like a drink that'll freeze the player or shrink them. We'll hoist our mugs into the air, shout, "Rock and stone," and then chug our virtual ale of choice. Shortly thereafter, one of us moseys over to the jukebox and drops a coin in. Before I know it, one of us is twirling like a ballerina while the other twerks adjacent to them. Someone else is doing the robot or some move reminiscent of Gangnam Style. Everything's alright.</p><p dir="ltr">For this reason, and countless others, I feel it's about time we talk about Deep Rock Galactic in the same vein as the greats. Since it's 1.0 launch five years ago, the cooperative shooter has proven time and time again that it is more than just another novel (yet niche) take on the formula once perfected by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-made-left-4-dead-special-according-to-the-devs-making-games-like-it/1100-6503996/">titles like Left 4 Dead</a>. It has instead carved out a unique and approachable vision of what this kind of game can be, filling titanic shoes and all the while paving a brighter and more inclusive road forward. That's especially difficult given the obnoxiously dark tunnels under Hoxxes IV in which Deep Rock Galactic takes place. But by sticking to its guns and never kowtowing to the pressure of chasing trends like countless other live-service titles around it, Deep Rock Galactic has succeeded where many have failed, and stands to continue longer than many of its contemporaries.</p><p dir="ltr">Between best-in-class squad-based gameplay with clear and distinct roles, procedural-generation tools and mission types that freshen every run, an appealing low-poly art style, a user-friendly approach to seasonal content, a focus on irreverence, and a community driven by kindness, there's very little that Deep Rock Galactic doesn't knock out of the park.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Rock and stone</h2><p dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic is a four-player cooperative shooter that tasks players with plumbing the depths of a hostile planet, Hoxxes IV, in search of materials to bring back to their parent company, the eponymous Deep Rock Galactic corporation. You are a squad of four blue-collar dwarves--complete with rad sci-fi equipment, pickaxes, a penchant for booze, and plump beards--working under the company on increasingly convoluted and dangerous jobs. Get in, get the job done, get the hell out of Dodge; that's the gig.</p><p dir="ltr">To describe it as some of the most fun I've had in a game is still doing it a disservice.</p><p dir="ltr">Every run of Deep Rock Galactic is a deliriously fun romp. Across Hoxxes IV's varied environs, which range from sand-blasted caverns and volcanic cores to fae-like crystalline caves and radioactive wastes, a vast range of mission types occupy the time of the dwarves that fill the ranks of the Deep Rock Galactic corporation. Sometimes, you will just have to harvest a certain kind of ore from a certain biome, like some kind of deep-space prospector, and other times, you are tasked with the assassination of monstrous bugs impeding progress. My favorite of these mission types involves building a pipeline to three pumps randomly distributed across the map. You have to lay it down piece by piece and can even grind on the rails of the pipe like you're some kind of dwarven skater. Once they're all connected and running, bugs will begin to target and break the pipes, prompting players to divide and conquer to defend the pipeline, all the while riding the pipes like an indoor rollercoaster. All in a day's work at Deep Rock Galactic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503617" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png" data-ref-id="1300-4503617"></a><figcaption>A gunner repelling an attack in one of Deep Rock Galactic's biomes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503617-drg_s05__1.46.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The varied and numerous jobs, as well as side objectives (like destroying a certain number of bug eggs) and possible encounters, ensure there's never a dull moment. Sometimes a mission will be going swimmingly until a titanic bug nukes you off the map. You'll be making your escape and be within feet of victory when an enemy type known to cling to the darkest part of the cavern ceilings extends a tentacle to pluck you off the ground and isolate you from the team. Deep Rock Galactic missions are rarely as simple as they seem on their face, and I always delight in the mischievous ways in which they twist the knife and provide another wrinkle and another story to tell ourselves and others.</p><p dir="ltr">To that end, each level--down to its composition and length--is procedurally generated, and for as long as I've played Deep Rock Galactic, I've rarely, if ever, encountered a level similar to any other, and that's kept me coming back for years. Over that span of time, the developers at Ghost Ship Games have built upon the game's foundation, adding modifiers, seasonal events, and additional mission types that have spiced up the diversity of content on offer. After some time away from the game, I recently revisited it and started a mission that culminated in an encounter that I had, miraculously, never done! Partway through another mission, a swarm of bugs covered in rocks appeared, forcing us to use our pickaxes to do damage to them as opposed to traditional weaponry, and this too was a surprising new addition. Since I first picked it up, the game has never lacked depth, but to see how far it's come after a few years is astounding.</p><h2 dir="ltr">"Teamwork and beer will keep us together"</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've settled on a mission, you and your party will be dropped onto the planet in pods that burrow deep underground, at which point you're prompted to pick a class and dig like your life depends on it...because it does. The four classes are composed of the gunner, engineer, scout, and driller. The gunner, as is maybe obvious, is the big damage dealer of the bunch, and comes complete with a good ol' six shooter, while the engineer supports the others with turrets and placeable platforms that smooth out maneuverability in the game's often-labyrinthine caverns. The scout is more of a lone wolf who can zip to places on their own with a hookshot, but also touts a flare gun that nails longer-lasting sources of light to walls to improve visibility. And then there's my personal favorite, the driller, who supports the rest of the team by dual-wielding large drill bits and detonating C4 charges that blow bugs and chunks of earth sky high with similar aplomb.</p><p dir="ltr">No one is locked into a role and your party can opt for any permutations of the crew, including all of one class or none of another. Deep Rock Galactic matches are likely best played with all roles equally represented, but tuning the difficulty down (or simply being really experienced with the game) can make up for some absences; otherwise you may as well be playing with an additional handicap. I've lost count of the number of times that I could've desperately used a driller to reach some out-of-reach goal because I'd gotten lost and separated from the rest of my teammates. I can also recount numerous times a well-placed zipline was the key component in my reckless extraction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503622" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503622"></a><figcaption>They're just here for the zipline.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503622-drg_screenshot_012.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Every class comes with its own set of unlockable weapons and they rarely step over one another in terms of utility. The driller, for example, mostly uses crowd-control weapons like a flamethrower, cryo gun, or sludge pump that can be charged to fire especially huge and debilitating globs of acid. The scout begins with a fairly standard assault rifle, but can eventually get a marksman rifle that can do massive damage with focus shots and their very own boomstick. Each weapon can be fine-tuned to your preferences via a skill tree and customizations, as well as overclocks that fundamentally change their natures.</p><p dir="ltr">In fact, just about every facet of the dwarves can be changed to your liking. Multiple seasons and years later, Deep Rock Galactic has a bevy of free customization options. They are unlocked by collecting resources and in-game money, as well as via progression on the season passes, which are all completely free and which you can swap between at any time. Additionally, there's a wealth of paid customization options that can be picked up too, but these are largely seen as a way to support the team for all of the free content that they manage to squeeze into the game.You can also swap out the pieces of your pickaxe, your helmet, your beard, and just about everything in between them. So yes, if you've been picking up on this game's pseudo-western vibe, you can rock a cowboy hat and live your space-western fantasy. As if that weren't enough, there are challenges that net players upgrade points that can be spent on active and passive perks, which can be slotted into loadouts, further diversifying the possibilities, and endgame activities such as Deep Dives offer rewarding paths of progression for folks looking to make these characters into full-fledged avatars of themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">In brief, there's no shortage of things to do or unlock in Deep Rock Galactic, and while development has slowed recently (mostly to accommodate the development of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactics-vampire-survivors-style-game-excels-by-giving-you-something-new-to-do/1100-6521414/">few</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deep-rock-galactic-to-get-haunted-and-hostile-roguelite-spin-off-check-out-the-debut-trailer/1100-6528035/">spin-offs</a>), it seems primed to continue.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Clocking out</h2><p dir="ltr">But if you were to ask me my favorite part of Deep Rock Galactic, it has very little to do with the action of an intense Hazard 5 mission or the joy of dressing up my dwarven miner. My absolute favorite aspect of Deep Rock Galactic is its emphasis on irreverence, and a community that often makes it feel like a home away from home.</p><p dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic is a blue-collar satire brought to life. This is a game which, upon loading into a lobby, feels like a post-work hang at your local happy hour. If I click in on one of my thumbsticks, my dwarf will often let out a "Rock and stone," a catchphrase the dwarves and workers parrot at one another to get through the hard times. As we plumb the depths of a hazardous cavern, we shout a hearty "Rock and stone" or one of its many humorous derivatives, or bemoan Karl, an unseen but legendary lore figure who seems to have perished before our time. Little did I know at the time that this facsimile of companionship and camaraderie was precisely what I was looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">I found Deep Rock Galactic at one of my lowest points. It was the midst of the early pandemic, and I was lost in more ways than one. Like countless others, my days were spent feeling stranded and alone inside my apartment. Eventually, I reached out to some of my oldest and closest friends, whom I hadn't spoken to for a long while at that point, and by their good graces, we reconciled and checked the game out. And perhaps because of that decision four-some-odd years ago, I find Deep Rock Galactic particularly endearing. It facilitated the rehabilitation of some of the most important relationships in my life. As we faked it as dwarven miners in space, we fell back into old bits, formed new inside jokes, and repaired the damage distance had wrought. We became best buds again. You know those memes where people gesture at deep late-night conversations they have while running in a circle in something like Minecraft? That was this game for me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503623" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4503623"></a><figcaption>A full crew back at HQ, and some of them even have celebratory drinks in hand.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1748/17481584/4503623-drg_screenshot_017.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I loved just loading into Deep Rock Galactic and throwing back a drink with my closest friends while holding late-night confessionals. I loved slacking off at the Abyss Bar, which is tended by a bowler-hat-wearing robot named Lloyd, only for management to admonish us. I loved pissing away company time by endlessly engaging in a competition of kicking a nearby barrel into a hoop. I loved that there was a tiny dance floor where I could cut a rug (please, Ghost Ship Games, give us some kind of synchronized line dance), or the fact that failing to extract from a mission prompted us to spawn from the med bay in a patient gown with a well-placed slit, through which we could see each other's underwear.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when my friends haven't been available to play, I've rarely run into a crew of players that was ever hostile to me--which may as well be the default in certain other online spaces and games. Veteran players welcome "greenbeards," or new players, with open arms, and I was never booted despite falling short of objectives, getting downed by overwhelming swarms, and failing to revive the rest of the crew to salvage the mission. This level of tolerance and patience for one another is a growing rarity, but the Deep Rock Galactic community has always enjoyed an abundance of it, and it's something I've tried to carry forward as I've become a more-experienced player.</p><p dir="ltr">I think the camaraderie comes from the framing of the game. At the end of the day, we're all at the whims of crappy managers and money men who see us as little more than digits on a spreadsheet, expendable and replaceable. Down in the mines, and in the pockets of time we get to enjoy above-ground before returning to them, we only have each other. So sure, the horrors persist, both in-game and outside of it, but so does the workman-like spirit of Deep Rock Galactic, which we carry with us.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Bucking trends</h2><p dir="ltr">In a similar vein to how the players look out for each other, Ghost Ship Games really looks out for its community. I've already mentioned this in bits and pieces, but a lot of noise deserves to be made about Deep Rock Galactic's approach to live-service content.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of its season passes (five and counting) are available to players entirely for free. Additionally, you keep access to those passes beyond the expiration of a season, meaning that years later, I can still access the means to unlock some cosmetics from 2021 if I so desire. Nothing gets ripped out of the game, and no one is ever gated from anything that's been offered, unless it was tied to some event that'll likely cycle back around. And nothing is kept from players who arrived to the game late. Just because I wasn't actively playing during a specific season doesn't mean I can't ever get it. Everything of import, be it a new mission type, piece of equipment, or biome, is added to the game at no cost to the player.</p><p dir="ltr">While this approach is gaining some traction with other games in the live-service sphere (like Marvel Rivals), Deep Rock Galactic has long felt like the pioneer of the philosophy in the modern era, and is still the most generous of the bunch. At a time when huge publishers and developers either rip content out of the game never to return it or push microtransactions and paid season passes on their communities every few months, Deep Rock Galactic and Ghost Ship Games come out looking like saints. By rejecting the modern sensibility to nickel-and-dime its community, Ghost Ship Games has fostered one that actually sticks around and cares for the game and one another, even if it has a smaller audience compared to the Fortnites of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">By comparison, Deep Rock Galactic feels like a thing built to last. It isn't built on trends or a callous model created to siphon your money and your time. Logging on and engaging in shenanigans with friends and randos alike, all the while earning little treats and trinkets like gear and cosmetics, feels intuitive and fun, rather than laborious. Despite its appearance and framing, it couldn't be less like work. And I guess that's what's kept me coming back all these years, and it's sure to keep me around another few as well. Rock and stone forever.</p>
