                <p dir="ltr">The longtime franchise mode in the Madden NFL series lets players make decisions for their favorite team, such as drafting players and signing free agents. New York Jets owner Woody Johnson gets to oversee these decisions in real life but has apparently used the Madden games as a pivotal resource in decision-making. In fact, Johnson reportedly axed a trade this past offseason involving a wide receiver because the player's rating in Madden NFL 24 was too low.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005485/2024/12/19/jets-jerry-jeudy-trade-madden-woody-johnson/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, the Jets were close to agreeing to a trade with the Denver Broncos in March for wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. But then, Johnson reportedly killed negotiations after looking at Jeudy's Madden NFL 24 rating. Electronic Arts tweaks player ratings throughout the season, but <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2023/07/24/madden-nfl-24-denver-broncos-ratings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Denver Post</a> notes that Jeudy was an overall 83 before the start of last season. Interestingly enough, the wide receiver--who ultimately was traded to the Cleveland Browns--still sports the same <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/ratings/player-ratings/jerry-jeudy/20940" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">83 overall rating in Madden NFL 25</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="306442581" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

                <p>11 Bit Studios has canceled Project 8, its console-centric game that began development around 2018. As of September 2024, 37 team members were involved in the project.</p><p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting. However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal,” said president Przemysław Marszał in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>He blamed COVID for some of the game's setbacks, and over time, delays accumulated and the project's budget grew. During Project 8's most recent milestone, the studio found that unresolved issues and challenges would have extended development time, and lost confidence in completing the game within a reasonable timeframe and at satisfactory quality. Thus, it was canceled.</p><p>An unknown number of developers will be laid off as a result of Project 8's cancellation, and some employees will be offered opportunities to transition to existing projects.</p><p>11 Bit Studios' latest game, Frostpunk 2, was released in September. It won the award for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">Best Strategy Game at The Game Awards 2024</a>. This year's show also introduced the "Game Changer" award for Amir Satvat, who has helped laid-off game developers find openings at other companies over the last year.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-drawing-a-line-in-the-snow/1900-6418286/" data-ref-id="1900-6418286">Frostpunk 2 review</a>, we said, "Frostpunk 2's challenging gameplay makes for a compelling experience despite a dour and cynical view of human nature."</p>

                <p>Later this week, Ben Schwartz reprises his role as Sonic in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-review-a-delightful-change-up/1900-6418326/" data-ref-id="1900-6418326">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. It's a part that Schwartz has played since the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-sonic-boom/1900-6417409/" data-ref-id="1900-6417409">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> film in 2020. But when it came time to pick one of his favorite video game characters of all time, Schwartz didn't go with Sega's blue hedgehog. Instead, he choose a supporting character from Square Enix's 1995 RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chrono-trigger-review/1900-6201545/" data-ref-id="1900-6201545">Chrono Trigger</a>.</p><p>While speaking with IGN, Schwartz cited Chrono Trigger's anthropomorphic hero Frog as his favorite. He recalled Frog's giant broadsword as "one of the coolest things of all time." Schwartz went on to call Chrono Trigger his favorite video game.</p><p>"It's an extraordinary game with an extraordinary soundtrack and story," recalled Schwartz. "Each character was unique. I feel like sometimes when I'm playing [Final Fantasy games] there will be some characters that you're like 'I guess I'll level this person up.' But in Chrono Trigger, every character you were emotionally invested in."</p><p>In 2021, Schwartz praised former Sonic voice actor Roger Craig Smith before revealing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonics-movie-voice-actor-ben-schwartz-has-not-been-approached-for-the-games/1100-6487386/" data-ref-id="1100-6487386">he was not approached to take over the role</a> in the games. Schwartz's Sonic 3 castmate, Keanu Reeves, voices his character, Shadow, in the recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/keanu-reeves-shadow-dlc-coming-to-sonic-x-shadow-generations/1100-6526686/" data-ref-id="1100-6526686">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 Movie Pack DLC</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-reruns/1900-6418303/" data-ref-id="1900-6418303">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>.
