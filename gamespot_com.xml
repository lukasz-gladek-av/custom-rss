                <p>The Switch 2 is about to become a hub for horror, as during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">September Nintendo Direct</a>, Capcom announced that it was bringing ports of Resident Evil 7 and Resident Evil Village to the Switch 2, while Resident Evil 9: Requiem will come to the console as well. All three games are launching for Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4566839-screenshot2025-09-12at10.03.02am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4566839" data-ratio="0.56598513011152" data-width="2152" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4566839-screenshot2025-09-12at10.03.02am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4566839"></a><figcaption>Switch 2 gets more Resident Evil games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4566839-screenshot2025-09-12at10.03.02am.png"></figure><p>Following the lukewarm reception and sales generated by Resident Evil 6, Resident Evil 7 is considered to be a major turning point for the franchise and Capcom. The first full-length game to utilize the RE Engine, Resident Evil 7 returned to the survival-horror roots of the franchise and it received critical acclaim. Capcom's Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes were also well-received, and the Resident Evil 4 remake was one of the best video games of 2023.</p><p>The next game in the series, Resident Evil: Requiem, launches on February 27, 2026, for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. The game will introduce a new protagonist--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-explores-the-backstory-of-new-heroine-grace-ashcroft/1100-6534107/">Grace Ashcroft</a>--and will see players return to Raccoon City, a location that has been left unexplored following its destruction in Resident Evil 2 and 3.</p><p>The September Nintendo Direct include lots of news and trailers--be sure to check out the gallery below to get up to speed with all the big announcements.</p>

                <p>More than a month before the release of Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Nintendo announced that paid DLC is already on the way to the upcoming monster-catching title during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7026/" data-ref-id="2900-7026">September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p>Titled Mega Dimension, the DLC will have additional story content and feature two Mega Evolutions for Raichu: Mega Raichu X and Mega Raichu Y.

According to a press release, "Mysterious distortions" appear in Lumiose City, which connect to "Hyperspace Lumiose." The teaser also showcases the designs for both Mega Raichu forms, with Mega Raichu X having two tails and Mega Raichu Y sporting longer, pointer ears.</p><p>Preorders for the DLC will come with "Holo-X and Holo-Y apparel items," which will be available for use in Pokemon Legends: Z-A when it launches on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 16.</p><p>A new trailer for the base Pokemon Legends: Z-A game premiered right before the DLC reveal.
