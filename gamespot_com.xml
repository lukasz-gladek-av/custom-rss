                <p>Humble has revealed its February 2025 Humble Choice lineup of PC games, giving subscribers a selection of classic and recently released titles to check out. If you're unfamiliar with it, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fkick-off-2025-with-8-games-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6528685%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1738317477392hgb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Humble Choice is a $12 monthly subscription service</a> that offers a monthly batch of PC games that are yours to keep forever, even if you cancel your membership. You'll also get several other benefits, like exclusive discounts at the Humble store and access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games exclusive to members.</p><h2>Humble Choice February 2025 Games</h2><ul><li>Immortals of Aveum</li><li>Trepang 2</li><li>Total War: Pharoah Dynasties</li><li>Fabledom</li><li>Griftlands</li><li>Tales and Tactics</li><li>Naheulbeuk's Dungeon Master</li><li>My Little Universe</li></ul><p><strong>Immortals of Aveum</strong> is the big draw this month, as this first-person fantasy game is a fun combo of magic and action. Sadly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/immortals-of-aveum-devs-address-its-struggles-truly-awful-idea-in-todays-market/1100-6521037/">it didn't set the world on fire when it was first released</a>, but if you're looking for a AAA single-player shooter that offers exciting challenges, tons of lore to explore, and breathtaking visuals, then you'll want to check out this underrated gem.</p><p>Another fun--and gory--FPS game available through Humble Choice this month is <strong>Trepang 2</strong>. It's a fast-paced shooter that lets you unleash an arsenal of powers against enemies, as you can utilize super-speed, intangibility, and super-strength to bulldoze your way through anything standing in your way. For something a little bit more cerebral, you can command ancient armies in <strong>Total War: Pharoah Dynasties</strong>, and <strong>Fabletown</strong> is a relaxing game where you can build the fairy-tale kingdom of your dreams.</p><p>You can also pick up the deck-building roguelike <strong>Griftlands</strong> this month while <strong>Tales and Tactics</strong> is a blender of genres like squad-based auto-battling, strategy, and roguelike elements. Sticking with fantasy, <strong>Dungeon Master</strong> is a fun satire of tabletop gaming, and <strong>My Little Universe</strong> takes you to the stars for a session of sci-fi survival.</p><p>As a reminder, all these games are available at no additional to Humble Choice members as part of their $12/month subscription. You can sign up now and gain immediate access to them all, and they're yours to download and keep forever. You'll also get all the other membership perks, including the Humble Vault and exclusive Humble Store discounts. As an additional goodwill bonus, 5% of every Humble Choice membership is donated to charity, and this month, proceeds will go to the United Negro College Fund.</p><h2>Humble Game Bundle Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdestiny-2-story-so-far-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-immortals-of-aveum-and-7-other-games-for-just-12-at-humble-this-month%2F1100-6529163%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny 2: The story so far</a> -- $30</li></ul>
