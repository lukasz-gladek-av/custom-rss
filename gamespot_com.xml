                <p>Anyone with the extremely specific requirement of wanting to play a turn-based strategy game on console that has "Songs Of" in its title can look forward to <em>two </em>games arriving next month. In a bizarre coincidence, both Songs of Silence and Songs of Conquest announced on the same day that they'd be headed to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, and in an even weirder twist of fate, they'll arrive a day apart from one another. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/songs-of-conquest/" data-ref-id="5000-497698">Songs of Conquest</a> will be out first for consoles on November 12, and it'll be followed by Songs of Silence on November 13.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616" rel="nofollow ">Lost in Cult marketing director Ryan T. Brown</a>, it's a strange example of serendipity, but the <a href="https://x.com/songsofconquest/status/1851362360423862500" rel="nofollow ">Songs of Conquest social media account</a> did respond to this positively by tagging its Songs of Silence counterpart and writing about how November could be awesome for the two games. Keeping the good vibes going, the <a href="https://x.com/songsofsilence_/status/1851363746431557646" rel="nofollow ">Songs of Silence account responded with an apt meme</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This is a bit wild. <br>Two unrelated turn-based strategy games, both with titles "Songs of ___", both announced they're launching on PS5 + Xbox Series, launching a day apart. They both announced this news in the same day. <br>Good luck to them, I'm sure they're livid ðŸ˜­ <a href="https://t.co/LEPYDYoBG2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LEPYDYoBG2</a></p>  â€” Ryan T. Brown ðŸŽ®ðŸ©· (@Toadsanime) <a href="https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1851282509897605616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While it's not unusual for games to make chance encounters--Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3, Overwatch and Battleborn being a few examples--rarely do similar games have release dates and release-date announcements come so close together--not to mention having near-identical titles to boot. Another prime example here would be The Outer Worlds and The Outer Wilds, as people often mixed the names of these two games up as they were released in the same year.</p><p>It's worth noting that while there are some similarities between these two games, they also put their own distinct stamps on the turn-based strategy genre. Songs of Silence is a good-looking 4X strategy game that aims to make battles feel more fast-paced, while Songs of Conquest is inspired by '90s games and will appeal to anyone who enjoys micromanaging their kingdoms and resources.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next content update has been detailed, and in addition to introducing a whole new zone to explore (something usually reserved for major raid tier patches), it will add a mount first teased over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.0.7 will bring players to the Siren Isle, where an expedition is underway to investigate a mysterious signal and discover what happened to the Kul Tiran forces that once occupied the island. The update will introduce two new questlines that will continue The War Within's story, one dealing with the aftermath of the destruction of Dalaran and the mages of the Kirin Tor, and another that will serve as a prologue to the game's 11.1 update, with Blizzard teasing the return of a "familiar face."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbXcFW7g-o0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vbXcFW7g-o0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Siren Isle in many ways looks to mimic <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-dragonflight-return-to-the-forbidden-reach-update-lands-on-march-21/1100-6512141/" data-ref-id="1100-6512141">Dragonflight's 10.0.7 update</a>, which similarly introduced a new endgame zone (in that case, a repurposed version of the Dracthyr starting zone). Just like the Forbidden Reach, players will be able to snag a powerful ring as part of the Siren Isle questline that can be outfitted with special gems granting unique powers. Blizzard said the ring will give players "an edge" on the Siren Isle and still be "fairly" strong going into the game's next season.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps most surprising is that come patch 11.0.7, players will finally be able to earn a Stormcrow mount that was originally teased as being earnable in the game's 2014 Warlords of Draenor expansion (and was actually datamined even earlier) but was never added to the game proper. Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as the Stormcrow mount is now officially named, will also be joined by other earnable mounts and transmog appearances Blizzard said were unused from previous years. In a preview video detailing the update, Blizzard said it was excited to get the old, unused content "into the players' hands" and that "they've seen them in the files long enough."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467" data-ratio="0.56238805970149" data-width="1675" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392467"></a><figcaption>Thrayir, Eyes of the Siren, as seen in the 11.0.7 update video.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4392467-stormcrowmount.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other additions coming in patch 11.0.7 include new Arathi elf-ear customization options for human and Kul Tiran characters, and even the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-plunderstorm-blizzards-take-on-battle-royale-makes-traditional-mmo-gameplay-walk-the-plank/1100-6521859/" data-ref-id="1100-6521859">Plunderstorm, WoW's take on a battle royale</a> that first debuted earlier this year. Blizzard said the mode will return in early 2025 for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not given an exact release date for when WoW's Siren Isles update, but it will be playable for testing on the game's public test realm servers October 31. In the meantime, players can check out the game's currently live 20th anniversary update, where players can earn updated versions of some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">WoW's most iconic armor sets</a> alongside plenty of other unique rewards.</p>
