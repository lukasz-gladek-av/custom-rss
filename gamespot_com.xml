                <p>Fortnite's latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">crossover event with The Simpsons</a>--which includes multiple Simpsons-themed skins and a new map inspired by Springfield--is one of the game's most successful events ever, with over three million concurrent players logging in over the weekend. A new short, uploaded today on the official Fortnite YouTube channel, shows how Epic Games will up the ante in tomorrow's update--if you plan to log in, keep <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awAmdYB6Xuc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watching the skis...er, skies</a>.</p><p>The short features Homer and Professor Frink speaking about the shard Homer has installed into his TV remote. Frink wants to analyze it, but Homer isn't through using it, as he immediately transforms a nearby round cloud into a massive donut, which falls from the sky. Homer then transforms Frink into a new version of Peely dressed as the professor.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GaYY9ghy8EQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GaYY9ghy8EQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video then shifts to gameplay footage, which showcases massive donuts falling from the sky all over the Springfield map. We also get new glimpses of some upcoming skins: Lisa Simpson, who is riding in a mech like her brother Bart; Moe Szyslak, the grumpy bartender; and Peely dressed as Professor Frink from the animated short, which seems to be the second skin available in the Springfielder Peely portion of the current battle pass.</p><p>Finally, the trailer shifts back to another animated scene, with the aftermath of Homer's antics in full view. The town is complaining to Mayor Quimby about the food raining from the sky, and the town agrees to put a stop to it. Meanwhile, Homer disposes of the shard by throwing it into nuclear waste, then falls into the waste himself--only for multiple Homers to appear, seemingly teasing the next major change coming to the Fortnite Simpsons event.</p><p>Fortnite is free to download and play on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, and mobile devices. The current Simpsons-themed season is scheduled to run until November 29.</p>

                <p>A new State of Play livestream has been announced for this week, but this time, it's going to be a little different. Sony has confirmed that State of Play Japan will be broadcast on <strong>November 11 at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET</strong>, and the show will be focused on games created in Japan and across Asia. Voice actor Yuki Kaji will also host the livestream, which will be in Japanese with English subtitles and will run for over 40 minutes.</p><p>"From beloved series to distinctive indie creations, the show, hosted by voice actor Yuki Kaji, will be packed with great games, interviews, and new looks at anticipated titles," Sony said.</p><p>As for the games, Sony has several products being developed in Japan and Asia, like the upcoming fighting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-tokon-looks-set-to-become-the-next-big-fighting-game/1100-6533923/">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> from Guilty Gear studio Arc System Works. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phantom-blade-zero/">Phantom Blade Zero</a>--one of several wuxia-inspired action games that have popped up lately--would also be a good fit, and Capcom has several projects of its own, like next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-wont-be-open-world-or-souls-like-promises-director/1100-6532554/">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/pragmata-check-out-screens-and-art-of-capcom-new-sci-fi-hack-em-up/2900-6895/">Pragmata</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7073/" data-ref-id="2900-7073">Sony's last State of Play livestream was held in September</a>, and it saw several games from western studios given the spotlight.

                <p>Celebrated video game composer Mick Gordon has revealed that he is working on his first full video game soundtrack in five years, for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">upcoming FPS game Defect</a>. The cyberpunk-themed asymmetric shooter will see Gordon bring his skills to the game, and for this project, he's aiming to push the music to the very edge of what's possible using his signature talent for heavy sounds and distortion.</p><p>"It's celebrating that deformity, almost like some form of rebellion," Gordon said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/mick-gordon-is-asking-how-heavy-can-we-get-it-in-his-first-full-game-soundtrack-since-doom-eternal-im-really-exploring-the-extremes-of-distortion-with-this-project/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I'm always trying to push it, always trying to push it more. Like, how heavy can we get it? I'm really exploring the extremes of distortion with this project. How distorted can you get it, where you lose the musicality, and then bring it back."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wr-kLx-ZPhM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wr-kLx-ZPhM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gordon added that he'll make use of synthesizer sounds traditionally associated with the cyberpunk genre, and he has a few ideas of how to put his own spin on those instruments. "Setting that background theme against this dystopian cyberpunk world gave me all sorts of ideas, especially with regards to synthesizers, and how synths should resemble analog machinery in a way," Gordon said. "Something that's palpable and tangible, and it must be alive within the sort of grimness of the cityscapes that this game takes place in."</p><p>One surprising influence for Defect's soundtrack comes straight out of the 1990 live-action Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, with Gordon remarking how one scene in particular featured a track during the <a href="https://youtu.be/CDJev_Sw-j8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Foot Clan recruitment drive</a> that caught his eye--or ear, to be more precise. While Defect marks the first full soundtrack that Gordon will be working on since Doom Eternal--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-eternal-composer-distances-himself-from-the-n/1100-6476272/">a project that ended Gordon's collaboration with developer Id Software</a> after a <a href="https://medium.com/@mickgordon/my-full-statement-regarding-doom-eternal-5f98266b27ce" rel="nofollow ">dramatic falling out</a>--he hasn't been sitting idly by.</p><p>Gordon helped compose a large chunk of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomic-heart-review-crispy-critters/1900-6418033/" data-ref-id="1900-6418033">Atomic Heart</a> soundtrack and contributed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/absolum-review-a-sleeper-hit/1900-6418419/" data-ref-id="1900-6418419">Absolum</a>, DotEmu's new fantasy-themed beat-'em-up that recently launched. Between those games, Gordon also did "production role stuff" with several metal bands.</p>
