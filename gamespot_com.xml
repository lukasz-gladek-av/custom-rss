                <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking for feedback from players as it proposes a new rule revolving around in-game currencies and transactions that would allow the current Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the protections it grants to consumers, to apply to certain video game companies.</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, the EFTA has been used to protect consumers from unauthorized transactions and requires financial institutions to fix errors and investigate and correct illicit transactions. The CFPB wants some of those same rules to apply to game companies whose products resemble "consumer asset accounts" that allow for converting in-game currency or goods into real money.</p><p dir="ltr">Under that interpretation, new regulations would apply to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> (which allows users to convert Robux into US dollars) and not games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, where in-game currency and goods can be purchased but can't be converted into real cash or exchanged between players. It would also likely apply to platforms like Steam, where users can sell in-game goods like weapon skins and other cosmetics for cash.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the distinction, the CFPB is asking players more broadly to share their experiences when it comes to purchasing digital goods and services in-game. It's asking for players to share their stories about issues they've encountered when using in-game currency, the kind of help (or lack thereof) they've received when something has gone wrong, and what protections they would like to see when it comes to protecting their in-game transactions and accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every year, Americans spend billions of dollars on video games and virtual worlds," the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/lfg-looking-for-gamers-cfpb-wants-to-hear-about-your-video-game-loot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CFPB writes</a> in its call for feedback and input from gamers. "A large portion of those expenses are purchases of gaming currency that is stored on a player's account and used for in-game transactions, like buying goods and services and person-to-person ("P2P") transfers. As detailed in our report on the financial risks of video games and virtual worlds, the ways in which these gaming currencies and accounts work is evolving rapidly, including to function more and more like banking and payment systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The CFPB goes on to state that gaming companies currently operate on the idea of "buyer beware," where users who run into issues converting currency, have their accounts hacked, or have their virtual goods stolen receive little to no help from game companies themselves. Those who encounter issues often have their refunds denied, may be banned from the game associated with their account, or are lost in customer service "doom loops" as they try to find answers, according to the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts," the CFPB writes. "The CFPB invites the public, including gamers, to provide comments and stories to our proposal."</p><p dir="ltr">The public will have until March 31 to submit a comment by emailing the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your contributions will help us shed light on features in the gaming industry that increasingly resemble traditional banking and payment options," the CFPB writes.</p>

                <p>Microsoft will launch Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, according to a recent report, and that might not be all.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateTheHate</a> revealed this on his podcast recently, adding that Final Fantasy VII Remake is coming to Xbox as well in 2025. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central reporter Jez Corden</a> corroborated this and said, "Microsoft isn't stopping there." Corden reported that Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and Gears of War Ultimate Edition are scheduled to come to PS5 this year. Whether or not they show up on Nintendo Switch 2, however, wasn't mentioned in the report.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1877777878630183001?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge recently said</a> that he was "willing to bet" that Microsoft would have some Xbox games "ready for the Switch 2."</p><p>Of course, plans can change at any moment, for any number of reasons, so while these reports claim to have accurate information, nothing is locked down for sure. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more information.</p><p>This report comes not long after an analyst said they expect 2025 to be the year that Microsoft begins to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-may-bring-all-their-big-games-to-ps5-analyst-says/1100-6528617/" data-ref-id="1100-6528617">"all their big games" to PS5.</a> None of this should be terribly surprising, though, as Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer himself has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-any-xbox-game-could-come-to-ps5-but-not-every-one-will/1100-6521148/" data-ref-id="1100-6521148">any Xbox game could come to PS5.</a></p><p>One of the next big Xbox games to come to PlayStation is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches for PS5 in Spring 2025. Beyond this, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">ongoing rumors of a Halo: Combat Evolved remaster project that could launch on PS5.</a> Looking further out, experts have said that the Halo franchise changing engines to Unreal would make it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">theoretically easier to bring the series to PlayStation.</a></p><p>In May, it was reported that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-pushing-for-no-red-line-for-what-games-could-come-to-playstation-report/1100-6523516/" data-ref-id="1100-6523516">mandating increasing margins at all divisions, including Xbox</a>. At the time, it was reported that Microsoft might look to release even more of its first-party games on PlayStation to help increase revenue. There is said to be an internal plan within Microsoft called "Latitude" that is focused on formulating plans to bring more first-party Xbox games to rival systems.</p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft is holding the next Xbox Developer Direct event on January 23, and the broadcast will feature a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-this-month-teases-brand-new-game/1100-6528709/" data-ref-id="1100-6528709">"brand-new" game. </a></p>

                <p>To counter fan harassment of its employees, from voice actors to developers, Square Enix has implemented a new Group Customer Harassment Policy. The new policy states and defines "customer harassment" of employees whether it's through violence, defamation, intimidation, or other means. Failing to respect these policies can result in Square Enix rescinding players' abilities to use its products.</p><p>"Such actions do not only prevent our employees and partners from engaging in their work with a sense of security but also causes disruptions to other customers," <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/customer_harassment_policy.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the policy reads</a>. "Square Enix will not tolerate harassment and will take action as necessary."</p><p>The policy does not give examples of harassment, but it's become clear within the gaming community why this inevitably had to be done: toxic fan behavior.</p><p>It's something the company has been dealing with for years. Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki Yoshida has addressed abuse against the game's developers on multiple occasions.</p><p>"I mean, I can take it, even though it doesn't make it less bad, but staff members will feel really down after getting those words when they gave their absolute best into trying to create something where everyone can enjoy," he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-naoki-yoshida-addresses-verbal-abuse-from-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> in 2022. "This may end up making them no longer create things that are fun from there on."</p><p>Just last year, Wuk Lamat voice actor Sena Bryer was sent transphobic threats following the Dawntrail expansion. Yoshida continued saying he took those attacks personally.</p><p>"She worked really hard and these criticisms were not constructive at all," added Yoshida. "It doesn't do anything except make the staff lose motivation, and in the end that could potentially damage the quality of our game and take away from what makes this game so interesting. So if there are any sort of criticisms, bring it to me, because I'm the one approving this material. I wanted to reiterate that, please refrain from personal attacks against our staff."</p><p>Square Enix also reserves the right to cease providing support services or products to harassers and may go as far as to protect employees through legal action or even criminal proceedings.</p>
