                <p>Microsoft's next big game, the RPG Avowed from developer Obsidian, launches on February 18. But the Premium Edition unlocks a full five days earlier, beginning February 13.</p><p>Obsidian has now posted the official unlock times for Avowed's early-access period, which begins at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on February 13. This works out to 6 PM in London and 7 PM in Paris. For people on the other side of the world, Avowed arrives at 3 AM in Tokyo, 5 AM in Sydney, and 7 AM in Auckland on Friday, February 14. You can see all the unlock times below.</p><h2><strong>Avowed early access unlock times</strong></h2><p><strong>Thursday, February 13</strong></p><ul><li>10 AM PT</li><li>12 PM CT</li><li>1 PM ET</li><li>3 PM BRT</li><li>6 PM GMT</li><li>7 PM CET</li></ul><p><strong>Friday, February 14</strong></p><ul><li>3 AM JST</li><li>5 AM AEDT</li><li>7 AM NZDT</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4442937-screenshot2025-02-12at1.45.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442937" data-ratio="0.55436893203883" data-width="2060" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4442937-screenshot2025-02-12at1.45.56pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4442937"></a><figcaption>Avowed is almost here.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4442937-screenshot2025-02-12at1.45.56pm.png"></figure><p>Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, but early access is not. For that, players have to buy the $90 Avowed Premium Edition. Alternatively, Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on for $22.50</a> that offers early access and other bonuses.</p><p>Microsoft offers a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-game-pass/pc-game-pass/direct?ef_id=_k_CjwKCAiAtYy9BhBcEiwANWQQL060WztejYDT820IxgrLK3sR8Q_jlevGUG8QtksNo3ABpHdap0WtShoCXNYQAvD_BwE_k_&amp;OCID=AIDcmmiixzwwab_SEM__k_CjwKCAiAtYy9BhBcEiwANWQQL060WztejYDT820IxgrLK3sR8Q_jlevGUG8QtksNo3ABpHdap0WtShoCXNYQAvD_BwE_k_&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAtYy9BhBcEiwANWQQL060WztejYDT820IxgrLK3sR8Q_jlevGUG8QtksNo3ABpHdap0WtShoCXNYQAvD_BwE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">14-day PC Game Pass trial for $1</a>, so anyone taking advantage of that offer could play Avowed for only $1. Microsoft is known to remove this special deal ahead of the launch of a high-profile game, but that hasn't happened yet.

                <p>Blizzard has big plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> in 2025, and one of them is a new mode that is unlike anything the game has seen before. Called Stadium, the mode is a competitive, round-based, third-person game mode where players upgrade their chosen hero over the course of a match using currency.</p><p dir="ltr">Revealed as part of Blizzard's recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream, Stadium is intended to join Quick Play and Competitive as a new, third pillar of Overwatch 2 when it arrives as part of Season 16 later this year. The mode will only be playable as a ranked game mode with role queue, and matches will play out in a "best of seven" format. Overwatch's normal Control, Push, and Clash game modes will be featured in Stadium, and players will still be using Overwatch's colorful cast of heroes. That, however, is where the Overwatch 2 players may be accustomed to ends and in many ways a whole new game emerges.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442716" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442716"></a><figcaption>Overwatch 2's Stadium mode will be played from a third-person perspective. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442716-overwatch2stadiummodethirdpersonsoldier76.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stadium will be the first game mode in Overwatch 2 to support a third-person camera, something recent hero shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> has used to great success. Players will, however, have the option to still play in first-person should they choose. The mode will feature a pre-round "buy" phase, where players can spend currency earned each round to purchase ability upgrades and stat-boosting items, MOBA-style. Items can do everything from granting players simple stat boosts like more health and faster movement speed all the way to granting attacks life-stealing or reducing the duration of negative effects.</p><p dir="ltr">Hero abilities can be augmented with currency too, granting them additional effects that can dramatically change the way a hero is played. Players will earn currency by killing enemies and earning assists, as well as a percentage of the damage and healing they do over the course of a round. There will also be a bounty system, where those who take out well-performing players on the enemy team will be rewarded with a currency payout.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, only 14 heroes in Overwatch 2's roster will be playable in Stadium mode "to ensure balance and competitive play," according to Blizzard. More heroes will be added to the mode over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442717" data-ratio="0.56227201667535" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442717"></a><figcaption>A look at the pre-round item shop where players can customize their hero with items and abilities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442717-overwatch2stadiumarmory.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Based on what Blizzard has described and shown, it sounds as if Overwatch 2 is taking the pre-round buying phases of games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a>, mashing it together with the third-person gameplay and MOBA-inspired item shop seen in Valve's still-in-the-works <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a>, and then combining it all with Overwatch to form a new game-within-a-game.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not the new mode catches on remains to be seen, but Stadium isn't the only major addition coming to Overwatch 2 in 2025. Blizzard additionally revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">loot boxes (originally removed when Overwatch went free-to-play</a> and transitioned into Overwatch 2) will be returning as part of Season 15 on February 18. The season will also introduce a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">new gameplay system in the form of Perks</a>, where players will be able to choose between ability-altering bonuses over the course of a match. New heroes are coming too, with Blizzard giving fans a first look at the crossbow-wielding Freya and the monk-like Aqua.</p>

In a newly released video, Ubisoft has offered a glimpse of what Shadows has to offer on PC and new-gen systems, including uncapped framerates and some truly breathtaking visuals of the game's recreation of feudal Japan.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xs2w3qSEBCs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xs2w3qSEBCs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Shadows' PC edition will feature an in-game benchmark that can determine the capabilities of the computer it's running on. Low-end and medium-end PC users won't be left out, as the game can be run in either low or high mode. But the more powerful computers will be able to handle ultra mode, which has stunning graphics.</p><p>Among the other features, Shadows includes ray-traced global illumination and reflections, dynamic seasons, and ultra-wide resolution support. However, some of the most fun may come out of the game's destructible environment. The sheer power of the samurai Yasuke can devastate everything around him, and even the ninja known as Naoe can leave a path of destruction in her wake.</p><p>Assassin's Creed creative director Jonathan Dumont recently indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-your-favored-main-character/1100-6529423/" data-ref-id="1100-6529423">Shadows will adapt if players favor Yasuke or Naoe</a> over the other, and most of the game's story can be experienced with either character. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-censored-in-japan/1100-6529030/" data-ref-id="1100-6529030">Japanese release has been censored by Ubisoft</a> because of the option to dismember enemy characters. But that feature can be turned on or off in other countries. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-accessibility-options-are-the-series-most-robust-yet/1100-6529024/" data-ref-id="1100-6529024">Shadows' also has robust accessibility options</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-release-its-expansion-in-a-much-different-way/1100-6529019/" data-ref-id="1100-6529019">an expansion</a>, which will be a preorder bonus rather than a standard DLC. However, the expansion will also be available for purchase at some point in the future.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be released on March 20 on Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC.</p>

                <p>There have been some rumblings in the past couple weeks that Fortnite would be collaborating with the Fast &amp; Furious movie franchise in the very near future--and those leaks took on a whole new meaning on Wednesday when we saw the very first teaser image for Chapter 6 Season 2, which showed a new version of Midas wearing Dominic Toretto's signature sleeveless black tee and gold chain--alongside a new season title, Lawless, and the launch date, February 21.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442845"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's Lawless season starts very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4442845-fortnitec6s2teaser.jpg"></figure><p>You can see it there just the left of the season title--Midas Toretto right there on a wanted poster. It's an image that puts an entirely new spin on some recent leaks that had seemed pretty run-of-the-mill initially. Specifically, there were two leaks: that Dom's Dodge Charger <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1886129604877804000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would finally be ported</a> from Rocket League to Fortnite, and that Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Han Lue (Sung Kang) <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1888663806428975496" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">would be getting skins</a>.</p><p>Since two Fast &amp; Furious cars were just brought over from Rocket League in the fall, it wasn't that big a deal to learn that others would follow. Rocket League has released five different Fast &amp; Furious cars over the years, and it only made sense to keep porting them. But the word that we'd be getting skins for Dom and Han made it clear that this stage of the Fast &amp; Furious collab would be a bigger deal--it indicated that Han's Mazda RX-7, also in Rocket League, could arrive imminently as well, for one thing. But now we have to also wonder if we might be getting one of these new character skins in the battle pass.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442889"></a><figcaption>Dominic Toretto's signature look.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4442889-dominictorettofortnite.jpg"></figure><p>This first official teaser, now, is only going to ramp up the speculation about whether this means that Chapter 6 Season 2 is an outright Fast &amp; Furious season. It's an exciting prospect for those who enjoy Fortnite's car-based gameplay, but it might inspire fear in the folks who detested last summer's divisive Wrecked season. But since the cars in Fast &amp; Furious are not usually weapon platforms, it's doubtful this car-based season would be quite as ridiculous as that one was.</p><p>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts on Friday, February 21, and it's very gradually starting to come into focus as the big day inches closer and closer. We're tracking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">all the rumors and leaks about upcoming content in the new season right over here</a>, so you don't have to.</p>

Will it protect you from the Elden Lords, should they ever pierce the membrane separating our dimensions? Probably not, so you'll want to consider using it only for cosplay purposes. Bandai says only 9,999 of these will be made, and they'll be available starting May 30.</p><p>One thing to also note here is that you're not getting a copy of Elden Ring Nightreign with this replica, but it is a nice addition to your collection if you picked up any of the previously released Malenia and Messmer Elden Ring helmets that Bandai Namco sold for a limited time.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is the latest entry in From Software's critically acclaimed souls-like franchise, following the release of Elden Ring in 2022 and its massive expansion Shadow of the Erdtree in 2024.</p><p>"Elden Ring Nightreign requires you to play a From Software game the wrong way. It asks players to prioritize aggression over stoicism; encourages almost reckless speed over careful strategy; and casts aside meticulous exploration for smash-and-grab expeditions," Tamoor Hussain wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>.</p><p>The game will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-sign-up-for-elden-ring-nightreign-beta-registrations-live-now/1100-6528736/">and an invite-only network test will kick off on February 14</a> and run through February 17.</p>

As it turns out, being an absolute menace to society at every chance you get unlocks a secret, morbid ending for protagonist Henry.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/think-twice-before-causing-too-much-trouble-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-because-henry-can-and-will-get-executed-and-theres-a-heartbreaking-cutscene-for-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> spotted an X/Twitter post from a player and YouTuber <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NikTekOfficial</a> that shows what happens when you "commit multiple crimes" in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and it doesn't end well. This is the final step in the game's crime-and-punishment scale, as it gets more dire each time you're caught--something that NikTek also <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1887654635319795970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">covered</a>.</p><p><em>Warning!</em><em> Spoilers for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 below. </em></p><p>Eventually, guards will capture Henry if he gets too out of hand, giving him the option to pay off his sins. There's also the more ballsy route to continue the chaos by fighting his way out of the predicament. If you want to try to pay it off, the amount set is always too high and Henry can only say he can't afford the price. From there, he's thrown in prison awaiting the hangman.</p><p>A nearly two-minute cutscene follows that has Henry getting jeered and spit on by a crowd as he's escorted to the gallows. As the standing stool is kicked from under him, the game over screen reads, "You have been executed for your crimes." What a way to go.</p>
