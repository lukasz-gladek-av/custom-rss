To mark the upcoming release, The Pokemon Company is partnering with the <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/en/pikachu_sweets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikachu Sweets Pokemon Cafe</a> in Tokyo to <a href="https://www.pokemon-cafe.jp/ja/pikachu_sweets/news/251121_3309.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">introduce a themed menu</a> inspired directly by the DLC's mysteries and motifs. These limited-time offerings aim to give fans a preview of what awaits in the expansion, in an edible form.</p><p>The highlight of the promotion is a pair of striking new donuts, currently referred to only as the Red Donut and Blue Donut--names chosen to avoid spoilers before launch. Despite the intentionally vague labels, their designs unmistakably resemble Groudon and Kyogre, the legendary Pokemon featured on the covers of Pokemon Ruby and Pokemon Sapphire. The official website even playfully teases their origins with the line: "They look like some kind of Pokemon…?", suggesting that these real-world treats may hint at major Legendary appearances within the DLC itself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611458" data-ratio="0.545" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4611458"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Pikachu Sweets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4611458-abdcd77a05827defbee1120302daf4ef78dbe772.jpg"></figure><p>The Red Donut will have a strawberry and tea Flavor, with the Blue Donut having a banana and lemon flavor. Both cost 550 yen.</p><p>Two drinks will also be available. Standard hot drinks featuring a special Hoopa or Gulpin design will be on sale during the promotion. A special drink, Hoopa's Mischief Ruby Chocolate Frappe, will cost 864 yen. The drink will be bright pink and feature an edible Hoopa on the top.</p><p>"This orange-flavored chocolate frappe is inspired by the mischievous Pokemon Hoopa," the description reads. "It's pink, yet chocolate-flavored! It’s just like Hoopa's mischief. Mix the refreshing orange flavor with the chocolate sauce at the bottom of the cup for a rich, varied taste."</p><p>Rounding out the themed lineup, the cafe will also serve a selection of playful hot drinks--each decorated with limited-edition Hoopa or Gulpin latte art--to keep fans warm during the winter launch window. These drinks join the already show-stealing donuts as part of the full collaborative menu, creating a small but memorable tasting tour through some of the motifs and mysteries players can expect to encounter in Mega Dimension. And of course, no Pokemon event would be complete without some kind of merch, so if you order a donut-and-drink set, it earns you an exclusive Pikachu Sweets sticker.</p><p>The new menu drops Wednesday, December 10, 2025, through Sunday, March 1, 2026, timed to coincide with the launch of the DLC itself on December 10. With Mega Dimension promising new Mega Evolutions, a Hoopa-centered narrative, and possible Legendary surprises, these treats offer a whimsical first taste of what's to come.</p>

                                        <p dir="ltr">The gates are open - and a new era of Hunters has arrived. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE brings the legendary rise of Sung Jinwoo to life like never before, capturing every ounce of heart, grit, and power that made Solo Leveling a global phenomenon. Available now on PC via Steam and Xbox PC, the game invites players to step into Jinwoo’s shoes and carve their own path from E-Rank underdog to unstoppable Shadow Monarch. With breathtaking visuals, cinematic storytelling, and exhilarating combat, this is Solo Leveling unleashed.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is Solo Leveling?</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608839" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608839"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608839-pr_slao_coop.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>Solo Leveling began as a breakout web novel that exploded into an award-winning Webtoon and anime. Fans gravitate to its fast-paced action, clean power progression, and the thrill of watching Sung Jinwoo rise from the weakest Hunter to a total powerhouse. His underdog-to-unstoppable journey is the heart of what made the IP a global phenomenon – and in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, you get to step directly into that rise.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Intense action with plenty of player choice</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Longtime fans and newcomers to Solo Leveling will find plenty to enjoy in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE. The game follows the story of Jinwoo from his lowly E-Rank Hunter days through his path to becoming a legend, adapting the series while adding several brand-new surprises in the story. You'll be able to change Jinwoo's appearance, too, giving our hero a fresh new appearance that's all your own. Incredible graphics accurately recreate the look and feel of the Solo Leveling world (and the ferocious monsters in it) that fans have come to love from the webtoon and the anime. The beloved voice cast of the anime adaptation have also returned to reprise their roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608053"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608053-250926_slaoss9large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In order to showcase Jinwoo's vast arsenal of abilities, the development team have crafted and refined a realtime, action-driven combat system that offers players a wealth of options for both gameplay and customization. Using an in-depth skill tree system, you are in full control of Jinwoo's growth, allowing you to create an incredible Hunter that plays exactly the way you like. Then, take those freshly-picked abilities and put them to use in thrilling fights! Use parries to expose and exploit enemy weaknesses, Chain Smash your way through powerful combos, and call upon the overwhelming power of Ashborn, Monarch of Shadows to seal your victory.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Raise the stakes with multiplayer and a wealth of options</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The title might be "Solo Leveling," but you don't have to adventure alone. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE features co-op battles with up to three other players online. This mode allows for a party of Jinwoo and other Hunters--or everyone can bring their own, custom-made Jinwoo to the battlefield for a true show of incredible combined strength! If you'd rather go it alone, however, you can recruit a group of CPU-controlled Hunters to bolster your ranks and help Jinwoo take on some of the special Hunter dungeons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4608054"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4608054-250926_slaoss8large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You won't ever have to worry about your adventure's progress being suddenly halted, either. Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE is a complete game package and does not require any further transactions after purchase — though you will be able to purchase certain cosmetics and emojis as additional DLC content. All of the Hunters, gear, and progression are earned through player effort and skill. You'll be able to jump in knowing you can enjoy the Solo Leveling experience with no strings attached.</p><p dir="ltr">But we've said enough--it's time to take Jinwoo's amazing journey into your own hands. Forge a unique path and discover your true potential in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, available now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omBP4nkFcNw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/omBP4nkFcNw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-is-giving-off-serious-animal-crossing-and-minecraft-vibes/1100-6534702/" data-ref-id="1100-6534702">it was announced</a> in September 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> appeared to be the franchise's cozy-game answer to Animal Crossing and Minecraft. But after the recently released extended trailer for the game, fans have pointed out intriguing and dark links to some of the previous titles in the franchise.</p><p>It's almost unsettling that one of the first things seen in the extended trailer is a devastated Pokemon Center and a generation-one Pokedex. As noted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1oxrrpd/cant_unsee_the_connection_after_rumors/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-upcoming-pokemon-pokopia-may-have-a-deeper-link-to-classic-games-fans-believe-heres-what-we-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), one of the fan theories suggests that Pokopia is set on Cinnabar Island from the Kanto region, which was originally featured in Pokemon Blue, Red, and Yellow. As depicted in Pokemon Gold, Silver, and Crystal, Cinnabar Island was devastated by a volcano eruption that left a Pokemon Center as one of the last remaining structures, much like the one glimpsed in Pokopia's trailer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDh6COB0Nqk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SDh6COB0Nqk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Professor Tangrowth--a character introduced in the trailer--mentions that he hasn't seen humans in a long time, but the island has other evidence that people once lived there including roads and other buildings. The strange Pokemon variations introduced in the trailer--like the stark-white Pikachu known as Peakychu--may have been created at Cinnabar Island's Pokemon Mansion. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pokemon Mansion was the place where Ditto could be found in the original Pokemon games.</p><p>Pokopia puts players in control of a Ditto that assumes human form and utilizes borrowed powers from other Pokemon to transform the landscape into a sanctuary free of human conflict. There don't appear to be any battles or a larger story in the game. But if it is set in a post-volcano explosion Cinnabar Island, it would be fitting if the land were healed by masterless Pokemon who weren't forced to fight each other.</p><p>Pokemon Pokopia will hit Switch 2 on March 5, 2026. In the meantime, fans of the franchise can immerse themselves in Pokemon Legends: Z-A. That game has introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-has-found-a-new-way-to-battle-but-it-needs-to-evolve-past-that/1100-6536431/" data-ref-id="1100-6536431">a new way for Pokemon to battle</a>, but it may need some work before it can become a competitive esport.</p>

                <p>After three years of mysteriously absent email-checking, Strong Bad has finally smashed his boxing-gloved fists onto the keyboard once more, returning with a brand-new message for his loyal fans. And in true Strong Bad fashion, it's about robots--again--and this time they apparently want to discuss their favorite sauces. His comeback feels like stepping back into Free Country, USA itself: chaotic, ridiculous, and somehow still deeply important to a generation. It also offers the perfect opportunity to revisit the era when Strong Bad and the rest of the Homestar Runner cast broke out of browser windows and into full-fledged video games.</p><p>The most defining gaming moment for the franchise came with the Telltale game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/strong-bads-cool-game-for-attractive-people-episod/1900-6195688/" data-ref-id="1900-6195688">Strong Bad’s Cool Game for Attractive People</a>, a five-episode point-and-click adventure released throughout 2008. The game played like an interactive Homestar Runner cartoon, built in close collaboration with the Brothers Chaps, who supplied writing, design input, and voice work. Guiding Strong Bad through his latest harebrained schemes--from band competitions to clumsy attempts at political takeover--gave fans a new way to revel in the character's larger-than-life personality, all while exploring familiar territory like the House of Strong and Bubs' Concession Stand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zhsNdk1_Vc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-zhsNdk1_Vc?start=1" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A large part of the game's charm came from its faithfulness to the original Flash cartoons. While it followed Telltale's traditional adventure formula, the world was loaded with oddball interactions, surreal conversations, and puzzles that functioned less on logic and more on the internal rules of Homestar Runner's absurdity. Each episode came packed with extra features, such as bizarre arcade minigames, collectible Teen Girl Squad cards, and hidden Easter eggs that rewarded longtime fans who had practically memorized the old website.</p><p>The success of that series helped cement the Homestar Runner universe as a surprisingly adaptable landscape for games. Beyond the Telltale collaboration, the franchise had already experimented with interactive experiences through its own iconic web games--Peasant's Quest, Stinkoman 20X6, and TROGDOR!--and later through the revival of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rMCkNgHa3c" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trogdor!! The Board Game</a> and its digital version. Even when Strong Bad wasn't hogging the spotlight, his attitude, snark, and tendency to go off the rails remained woven into the fabric of these projects. With his latest return to the inbox, he's once again reminding the world that Free Country, USA is only an email away.</p>
