                <p>The early years of Assassin's Creed saw players explore both the past and the modern day through its protagonist Desmond Miles, and while recent games have focused less on the person inside the Animus, Ubisoft plans to address that in the future.</p><p>In a recent interview, Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Cot√© reflected on how recent games struggled to create a meaningful connection between the past and the future. In the context of Assassin's Creed, ancient history is recreated through the Animus, a virtual-reality machine that taps into a subject's DNA and allows them to experience the genetically inherited memories of an ancestor. At the center of this idea was Desmond Miles, who entered the Animus and became a narrative anchor point for the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Real History of Assassin's Creed | The Real Assassin's Order</p>
      </div>
<p>"Desmond's journey was at the heart of the modern-day conflict driving the search for powerful Isu artifacts--Pieces of Eden--that could change the course of history," Cot√© said to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. However, with his death at the end of Assassin's Creed 3, we faced a creative crossroads. "Ending Desmond's arc was a difficult decision, and afterward, the modern storyline struggled to find its footing."</p><p>To address this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will lay the groundwork for the future of the series, as it'll be integrated inside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-everything-we-know-about-ubisoft-game-hub/1100-6503702/" data-ref-id="1100-6503702">Assassin's Creed Infinity</a>, a hub presented as an in-universe Animus that will host the ongoing modern-day narrative. Cot√© explained that this will allow the contemporary storyline to "enhance" rather than overshadow the historical journey, creating a "meaningful contrast between past and present" that will focus on how the past shapes the present and themes of freedom versus control.</p><p>"The groundwork for this new direction will take shape with Assassin's Creed Shadows, which will lay the foundation for this narrative evolution that will grow in the years to come," Cot√© said.</p><p>Originally scheduled to launch in October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to February 14, 2025</a>. Ubisoft said at the time that the delay was made to give the developers more time to polish the game, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-assassins-creed-shadows-early-access/1100-6527307/" data-ref-id="1100-6527307">Assassin's Creed Shadows' early access has also been canceled</a>.</p>

                <p>Halloween may be over, but as they say on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/x-files-creator-claims-ryan-coogler-is-rebooting-the-franchise/1100-6512774/" data-ref-id="1100-6512774">The X-Files</a>, the truth is out there in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-online-review/1900-6415473/" data-ref-id="1900-6415473">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>. Alien abductions are still taking place in Los Santos, and you're going want to be among the abductees if you'd like to get a cool weapon. But players are going to need to act fast, because these visitors from another world won't be hanging around forever.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3335k2ok38135/escape-alien-abduction-in-gta-online-this-halloween" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rockstar Games</a> announced the alien abduction for this year's Halloween events, and it's going on through November 6. That means the skies are still strange, and players who make it out alive can earn The Shocker, a non-lethal alien weapon that acts like a stun baton. The hard part, however, might be getting captured in the first place.</p><p>The first thing that you need to know is that the aliens only come out at night from 10 PM to 4 AM in the game world, and given GTA Online's fast movement of time, this means that there's only a 12-minute window to find a UFO ship and get under it. Another complication is that your vehicles will fail if they get too close to the UFOs, so plan accordingly.</p><p>If you've successfully pulled off the abduction, the next step is escape. Players will find themselves locked in a room under Fort Zancudo. That's where The Shocker can be found, but players still have to get out with their lives in order to keep it. Opening the exit requires some close examinations of the clues in the chamber. Fortunately, The Gaming Gorilla has shared a video that breaks down how to get out of the room before a lethal gas makes this a one-way trip.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44cHCm6FM08" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44cHCm6FM08" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you miss your opportunity to get abducted this year, it's likely that Rockstar will revisit the idea in time for Halloween 2025. But for now, you only have until Wednesday, November 6 to pull off what may be the spookiest mission in the game to date.</p>
