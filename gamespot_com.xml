                <p>Earlier this year, Krafton released the life-sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">InZoi</a> in early access with the promise of free DLC throughout the year. Now, details about the second DLC have been revealed, and it's coming later this month alongside InZoi's debut on Mac.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoD3q-qOVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uoD3q-qOVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new DLC is called Island Getaway, and it was inspired by the tropical locations in Southeast Asia. It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>

                <p>Thirteen years after it first appeared in The Sims 3, singer Katy Perry surprised fans when she reprised her hit song "Last Friday Night" at a concert this week--and sang in Simlish, the nonsense language of Sims characters.</p><p>On X, TheWitnessedBoy shared a clip from a TikTok user of Perry from a recent concert (via<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-simlish-sims-3-concert-last-friday-night-video-2000616677" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a>), in which the singer accepted a fan's request to sing Last Friday Night in Simlish. Rather than sing the entire song in Simlish, Perry opted to start with the chorus. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry‚Äôs tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p>  ‚Äî Fadi ¬π‚Å¥¬≥ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Perry was a prominent promotional partner of Electronic Arts in marketing The Sims 3 in 2012, with the game's Showtime expansion pack even having a Katy Perry Collector's Edition.

But don't hold your breath for The Sims 5.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> is secretly the most popular game around. This May, the Roblox game "Grow a Garden" surpassed seven million concurrent users--but Roblox itself has been hugely popular, especially with kids, for years. Case in point: YouTube revealed today that Roblox-related videos have surpassed 1 <em>trillion</em> views. Trillion.</p><p>To celebrate the momentous number, YouTube has launched a Roblox Museum within Roblox, which the company describes as "a virtual space where anyone can go to visit over 100 special relics, each representing a key creator moment from over the years." YouTube and Roblox debuted within a year of each other, YouTube notes, and so Roblox videos have been a part of YouTube for almost its entire lifetime. If you don't play Roblox but want to check out the museum, YouTube released a preview hosted by Roblox content creators Lanaslifeee and MeEnyu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2Kfm-knAc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4q2Kfm-knAc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For those who want to check out the museum for themselves, you can also hop directly to the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/87445296052708/YouTubes-Roblox-Museum" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">museum's landing page</a> on Roblox. The museum also features a scavenger hunt that will reward you with an exclusive in-game item.</p><p>Roblox is the second game to reach the trillion-view milestone. Just short of three years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> reached a trillion views, and released a video to celebrate at the time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISWaWS7mVac" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ISWaWS7mVac" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This comes at an interesting moment for the game. A quick scroll through the comments reveals that players aren't terribly interested in the video itself, and are instead much more focused on the age verification requirements coming to the game, which involve allowing an <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/robloxs-new-age-verification-feature-uses-ai-to-scan-teens-video-selfies/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI to scan a video selfie</a> before players will be allowed to fully access Roblox's soon-to-be tiered communication system.</p>

Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA promised the plagiarized art would be removed and replaced, and thanks to an update today, these cards now feature the official artwork.</p><p>When Wisdom of Sea and Sky first launched on July 30, an artist by the name of Lanjiujiu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">came forward with a comparison</a> of their own art of Ho-Oh and the version that was seemingly traced over for the expansion's cards.</p><p>The developers immediately released a statement about the incident, claiming that "the card production team provided incorrect reference material as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p><p>Due to these issues, Pok√©mon TCG Pocket was forced to pull the art from both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX, the latter of which featured the plagiarized Ho-Oh artwork. That meant that for the next week players who cracked packs and received these legendary cards were greeted by an admittedly hilarious sight: a completely plain card that simply featured text saying that new artwork would be coming soon.</p><p>Now though, both Pok√©mon cards boast entirely new art, and players who already pulled them should now have the updated assets. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spotted that the new replacement designs are credited to the same artist, Sie Nanahara, who also made the now-pulled art that these cards first launched with. In response to Pocket's plagiarized assets, as well as their swift removal, Lanjiujiu shared, "I appreciate the prompt resolution and hope this matter rests here."</p>
