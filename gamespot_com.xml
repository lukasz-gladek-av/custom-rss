Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, for example.</p><p>Along with current first-party PlayStation and Xbox controllers, the adapter supports legacy Nintendo and PlayStation controllers, including the Wii Remote, Wii U Pro Controller, DualShock 4, and DualShock 3. If the controller supports vibration and/or motion controls, it typically supports those features when synced to the adapter. It's also compatible with all 8BitDo Bluetooth controllers, including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Arcade-Stick-Switch-Windows-nintendo/dp/B08GJC5WSS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch/PC Arcade Stick</a>, which has yet to receive an official Switch 2 update.</p><p>You can use your PS5's controller settings or the Xbox/PC accessories app to remap inputs, but 8BitDo's Ultimate Software offers support for Microsoft's first-party controllers, DualSense, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro Controllers.

That said, we wouldn't recommend buying that one since it doesn't support Xbox Wireless Controllers and costs the same price.</p></div>                      </div><h2>How to set up 8BitDo Adapter 2 on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>Once you get your adapter, you'll need to connect it your Windows PC or Mac and download <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/firmware-updater.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo's firmware updater tool</a> or <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate/usb-adapter-2.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Software</a>. The latest update adds Nintendo Switch 2 support. After completing the update, which only takes a few seconds, you can connect it to one of the free USB-A ports on the Switch 2 dock.</p><p>Before you can sync a controller to the adapter, you need to enable support for 2.4GHz Wireless and wired controllers. In System Settings on your console, find Controllers &amp; Accessories, and make sure the box for Pro Controller Wired Communication is checked.</p><p>To establish a wireless connection, press the pairing button on the top of the adapter and enter pairing mode on your controller.</p><p>The 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 is a handy little device for platforms beyond Nintendo Switch 2 and Switch.

<section><p>The Lumines series is getting a major glow-up--literally and metaphorically.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After playing 20 minutes of Lumines Arise, the team from Enhance presented me with a difficult decision. "We have another 20 or so minutes left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time asking us some questions, or would you like to play a bit more?" And as much as I wanted to jump straight into interviews and pick the minds of the folks who brought us Humanity, Tetris Effect, and Rez Infinite, I found myself betrayed by my own childlike glee.</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you mind if I do just a couple more levels?" I asked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in that moment--when the part of me that simply loves games overtook the part of me that tries her hardest to maintain a writer's sensibilities--that I realized I <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with Lumines Arise. And though of course I took time to chat with game and art director Takashi Ishihara and creative producer Mark MacDonald and enjoyed every minute of it, I left the preview event wishing that somehow the next entry in the Lumines series was back at my hotel, loaded up on my Steam Deck, and waiting for me to get back to playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't to say I didn't get enough time to get a sense of how Lumines Arise is shaping up. During the preview event, I played through a pre-made playlist of four songs followed by <em>another</em> playlist with two additional songs after I proved overly voracious. With each track lasting around four minutes, this made for around 30 minutes of Lumines Arise goodness. From what I gathered, it seems as though the mode I played essentially allows players to construct their own setlists by selecting songs from the game's main story, referred to as Journey mode. As such, I encountered the songs out of order and without the context that I assume would be provided in story mode. And yet, that didn't stop them from being visually delightful, memorable, and, most importantly, a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721"></a><figcaption>A golden-hued level that sees players arrange dark blue orbs and yellow squares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with Lumines, the overall gameplay feels very similar to Tetris: Blocks fall down, you rotate and place them to help clear the board, and "topping out" spells game over. However, whereas Tetris sees you place tetrominos of various shapes down to help form lines that then clear your board, Lumines focuses entirely on squares. Each construct you are given is 2x2 consisting of up to two different types of blocks; as you place them down, your goal is to form squares (2x2 or greater) consisting of the same block type.</p><p dir="ltr">Once a square is formed, you have until the vertical "Time Line" sweeps across the board to add to it, making the seconds between a square's construction and that sweep a rush to extend your block to a 3x3, 4x4, and so on. Though it doesn't directly correlate to the track's RPM, the Time Line helps emphasize the musicality of the game and builds up your internal rhythm. Arise also gets a new twist with its Burst meter, which slowly fills up over time and can then be used to lock a square to your grid for a few passes of the Time Line, allowing you to add to it for longer and subsequently clear more of the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this is all relatively simple to grasp, it's certainly harder in execution. And interestingly, the more I <em>thought </em>about what I was doing in Lumines Arise, the trickier things seemed to become. Fortunately, everything about Arise--from its music and visuals to its gameplay--encourages you to enter the same trance-like flow state it inhabits. Everything is fluid, stylish, and hypnotizing. And yet, there is an undeniable tension that comes hand-in-hand with these sorts of puzzle games--the ones that can grow overwhelming, constricting, and unwieldy with just a few poorly placed tiles. Ultimately, though, all this makes for wonderful juxtaposition that is not just a core part of Lumines Arise mechanically, but narratively as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712"></a><figcaption>A darker level that is largely silent and features empty boxes and clunky, metal box fans.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't play Arise's Journey mode, one of the handful of levels I did play was notably darker in tone than the others, offering a look at places the game's narrative might go. In place of pulsing lights and electronic pop was oppressive silence and mechanical groans; rather than placing down flashing circles and boxes, I was given harsh, metal box fans and hollow white boxes to try to form into squares. Within a minute, I felt incredibly tense, and told the team as much with a nervous laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">According to creative producer Mark MacDonald, this was entirely the point, as Arise's story focuses on "life's highs and lows, and how we balance the good with the bad." Naturally, actually tackling this theme and conveying these messages is a bit difficult due to the game's lack of a written narrative. Though having songs with lyrics in the game can act as a sort of "cheat," MacDonald laughed, as it gives players a more clear sense of how they are meant to feel, lyrics can often be a bit abstract or metaphorical. Atmosphere, then, is largely how the team makes this happen, and just as Lumines influenced how Enhance constructed Tetris Effect's environments and storytelling, the team said they looked to Tetris Effect to shape Arise.</p><p dir="ltr">"A challenge of our games is that we are telling stories in abstract ways and in ways only we have really done," MacDonald said. "Lumines informed Tetris Effect, and now we're seeing things circle as Tetris Effect shapes Lumines Arise."</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after this interaction, the eerie, monochromatic level started to unweave itself and came to an end. I was then greeted by two dancing chameleons, having the time of their lives, while a fast-paced song thumped away in the background. These levels are indeed an abstract and interesting take on life's "highs and lows," but they absolutely rule, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711"></a><figcaption>A funky level that features two chameleons and circles and squares to arrange.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As I bobbed my head along to the music and got back into the swing of things, game and art director Takashi Ishihara was delighted that the atmosphere he and the team had constructed was doing precisely what was intended.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some people cried when they finished Tetris Effect, and we were blown away by that response," Ishihara said. "I think people who have a deep connection to art and music--who are connected to their emotions and sensitive to atmosphere--will really respond to [Lumines Arise]."</p><p>That said, I suspect that even those coming to Lumines Arise purely for a delightful new puzzle game will still be plenty impressed. It's fun, engaging, <em>slightly</em> tense, visually spectacular, and has the same delightful fluidity that Enhance is known for delivering. All in all, I can't wait to spend more time with it once it hits PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

                <p>It's been almost a decade since the original Postal was given a modern remake in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-redux-pc-release-date-announced-ps4-edition/1100-6439661/" data-ref-id="1100-6439661">Postal Redux</a>. Now, it's time for 2003's Postal 2 to get the same treatment with Postal 2 Redux, "a ground‐up overhaul" of the original game.</p><p>Postal 2 Redux is in development with Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors, with a Kickstarter campaign slated to begin later this summer. According to the announcement, the revitalized game grew out of an initial attempt to bring Postal 2 to VR. Now, the original assets will be recreated in Unity with "enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‐up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNUeNiAplI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzNUeNiAplI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the announcement teaser doesn't have much to show off, some of the features planned for Portal 2 Redux include the ability to pet Champ the dog, as well as the addition of dynamic lighting, more refined crowds, fully breakable interiors, and an open world that can be explored without any loading screens.</p><p>According to the developers, the plan is to bring Postal 2 Redux to PC, macOS, Linux rigs, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Switch 1 or 2. However, the team notes that the final platform lineup has yet to be finalized and it may depend on stretch goals achieved through Kickstarter as well as approval from the console-makers in question.</p><p>The Kickstarter pre-launch page for Postal 2 Redux is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently online</a>, but the campaign doesn't have an official start date yet. There's no word about whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-iii-review/1900-6348436/" data-ref-id="1900-6348436">Postal 3</a> may get remake as well. That game was so poorly received among Postal fans in 2011 that Running With Scissors later retconned <a href="https://postal.fandom.com/wiki/Postal_III" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Postal 3 as a non-canonical game</a>. The most recent title in the franchise was Postal 4: No Regerts, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/" data-ref-id="1900-6417864">debuted to bad reviews</a> in 2022.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 2nd Trailer: Formidable Foes Emerge</p>
      </div>
<p>Up until now, all mainline Onimusha games have been connected narratively since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/onimusha-warlords/" data-ref-id="5000-1574">Onimusha: Warlords</a> kicked things off in 2001, often having their protagonists fighting demonic Genma and a possessed Oda Nobunaga's forces. Capcom even went through the effort of remastering the first two games in the series in the 2020s, so it could be believable that it was prepping players to understand the series' overarching narrative and lore prior to its continuation. That's not the case, though, as the only real connection is that players are still fighting Genma and Kadowaki admitted that Way of the Sword's development was separate from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-gets-a-modern-remaster-this-year/1100-6529245/" data-ref-id="1100-6529245">those remaster efforts</a>.</p><p>Players will control a new protagonist named Miyamoto Mushashi, whose face is modeled after actor Toshiro Mifune and who wields an Oni gauntlet that gives him special powers. That all may sound familiar to those who watched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflixs-onimusha-anime-brings-together-three-japanese-legends/2900-4875/" data-ref-id="2900-4875">Onimusha series on Netflix</a> last year. But once again, Kadowaki denied any sort of connection between the show and new game, even though they both feature the same character modeled after the same real-world actor. "There's absolutely no connection with the Netflix animated series," Kadowaki bluntly confirmed.</p><p>If you are planning on playing Onimusha: Way of the Sword when it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026, you at least don't have to worry about this franchise's past, as it's a clean slate narratively.</p>

Brandon Adler said in an interview that Obsidian did not set the price for the game, adding that anyone bothered by the price point should take their concerns to Microsoft.</p><p>"We're a game developer. We love to make games. We don't set the prices for our games," he said in an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interview with GamesRadar</a>. "Like, personally, as a game developer, I wish everybody could play my game, because that's what I want out of this whole thing. But for the reasons and so like, why the $79.99 price point, you'd have to honestly talk to the Xbox folks."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is Microsoft's first $80 game, but it wasn't a total surprise, given that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">said it would begin charging $80 for some games in 2025.</a> Microsoft also raised prices on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, while there are expectations that other publishers will follow suit and start charging more as well. 2K Games has been caught up in pricing drama, too, as Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-reacts-to-price-point-controversy/1100-6531739/" data-ref-id="1100-6531739">he doesn't know if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not.</a></p><p>What Adler said about The Outer Worlds 2 lines up with what Pitchford has said about Borderlands 4. He mentioned that, as an artist, he wants as many people as possible to play his games. At the same time, he acknowledged that it's a business and the company has to keep making money to make more games. Like Adler, Pitchford also noted that he does not set prices; in his case, 2K Games is making the call.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said again and again that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">it's his job to make money and run a successful business</a>, even if this means the company has to make some tradeoffs.</p><p>"We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us," Spencer said.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. If you don't want to pay $80 for it, you can subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate and play it via your membership. Game Pass is not available on PlayStation, however.</p>
