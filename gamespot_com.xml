                <p dir="ltr">After the 2019 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein/" data-ref-id="5000-464088">Code Vein</a>, Bandai Namco staked its claim in a genre it helped popularize as the publisher of games like Dark Souls. Code Vein married that Souls gameplay with its penchant for anime aesthetics to manifest a world of vampires and tough-as-nails action. Now, years later, the team behind that freshman effort is returning with an expanded sequel that will give fans of the sleek anime souls-like more to chew on.</p><p dir="ltr">Keita Iizuka, producer of Code Vein and its sequel, acknowledges that the genre has changed since Code Vein released, but sees it as a challenge to rise to. “Yes, games like Elden Ring are very praised,” Iizuka starts with a glint in his eye, “But I like to consider those games our rivals.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> CODE VEIN 2 — Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/code-vein-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-681504">Code Vein 2</a> started development just after the first game wrapped, it is clear that the developers have tried to anticipate where souls-likes might go. While the first title was a bit like souls-likes at the time in structure--which is to say, the non-linear freedom to get lost but not much choice in where to go--Code Vein II looks to rectify this. This time around, the game is expanding around the edges, letting players look for bosses and dungeons in an open environment. The player-character, once again custom-made, even has a slick motorcycle to help facilitate exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">And explore you must, even if you have played the first title. Code Vein 2’s world has no connection to the first game in terms of narrative, IIzuka says.</p><p dir="ltr">“It is a new world, new characters, and a new story,” he explains. This does mean that Code Vein’s ending cliffhanger, which implied a connection to the God Eater series but still left fans desperate to know more, will not be followed up on with the sequel. Those hoping for some resolution to the harsh cut-to-black tease from Code Vein’s ending will not find it in this sequel, at least as far as Iizuka is willing to admit right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511994"></a><figcaption>Code Vein 2 does not follow up on the first game's cliffhanger ending.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511994-ss_f53df962d8bd99bd5afab9b3d424fcd64b13fffb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Instead, Code Vein’s narrative tells the story of a world where humans and revenants, the series’ name for vampires, must join forces to stave off a world-destroying force that threatens them both. To do so, you as a revenant hunter must travel between the past and the present to better the world. This is also the driving force behind Code Vein 2’s other major improvement: a time-travel mechanic where actions and quests in the past affect the future.</p><p dir="ltr">When pressed for examples, Iizuka mentioned that saving a bridge repairman in the past gives the player access to a dungeon they otherwise might not have been able to reach in the present. If an NPC has a life goal of creating a specific tool, that character may not have survived into the present, but helping them achieve their goal likely means that tool is waiting for you to use years later.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond those new mechanics, Code Vein 2 is not looking to reinvent the wheel. Iizuka is clear-eyed on his vision: marrying sleek anime-style characters and action with the more thoughtful and pensive gameplay of a souls-like. As such, players will find aspects of Code Vein have been expanded, like a brand-new agile dual-wielding weapon type to attack enemies while looking cool doing it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4511995"></a><figcaption>Like the first game, partner NPCs play a crucial role in combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4511995-ss_3857481b5d7fe1d4c7664383536fe0793f6e0075.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Partners also once again play a major role, which Iizuka believes sets the Code Vein series apart from other games. With it, players encounter and recruit NPCs to go through dungeons and beat bosses with them. The decision of who to take with you is a strategic one, but even characters who may not make sense strategically could be a player’s favorite or have story implications. Iizuka wants players to have to think hard about who has their back.</p><p dir="ltr">“That sense of overcoming trials and achieving victory creates a unique sense of enjoyment,” he explains. “Because [Code Vein 2] takes place in a different world with new characters, even if you have played [Code Vein], I think you will fall in love with these new characters.”</p><p dir="ltr">Code Vein 2 is releasing in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p>After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-strike-may-be-over-soon-after-tentative-deal/1100-6532302/" data-ref-id="1100-6532302">reaching a tentative agreement</a> with video game companies to end the 11-month video game actor strike, SAG-AFTRA has now officially confirmed that the strike ends today, June 11, at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.</p><p>All SAG-AFTRA members are now <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-video-game-strike-suspended-noon-pt-today" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cleared to go back to work</a>, including promotional work. The union said it will convene a special meeting on June 12 to "consider the tentative agreement." If approved, the agreement will then be sent for ratification by the union's members. This is also when the full terms of the agreement will be published.</p><p>The video game companies released a statement regarding the strike coming to an end, with spokesperson Audrey Cooling saying the companies are "pleased to have reached a tentative contract agreement that reflects the important contributions of SAG-AFTRA-represented performers in video games."</p><p>The statement goes on: "This agreement builds on three decades of successful partnership between the interactive entertainment industry and the union. It delivers historic wage increases of over 24% for performers, enhanced health and safety protections, and industry-leading AI provisions requiring transparency, consent and compensation for the use of digital replicas in games. We look forward to continuing to work with performers to create new and engaging entertainment experiences for billions of players throughout the world."</p><p>The strike began in July 2024. The union and video game companies agreed to terms on a number of points in negotiations, but a sticking point was the matter of AI. As such, it'll be interesting to see the terms of the agreement and how it all shakes out with regards to protections against AI.</p><p>In May, Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-voice-of-master-chief-asks-halo-fans-to-stand-up-for-voice-actors-on-strike/1100-6531524/" data-ref-id="1100-6531524">the importance of getting a deal</a> that offers performers assurances that their voices can't be used by AI duplicates without their permission.</p><p>The video game companies were reported to have made what was characterized as "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-companies-make-key-ai-concession-in-latest-offer-to-end-actors-strike/1100-6531513/" data-ref-id="1100-6531513">a key concession</a>" on AI, but it remains to be seen what this might be. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p><p>This wasn't the first SAG-AFTRA video game actor strike. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-video-game-voice-actor-strike-is-ending/1100-6453577/" data-ref-id="1100-6453577">2016-2017 video game actor strike also ran for about 11 months</a>, with performers winning benefits including $100+/hour pay rates, bonus, and more.</p>
