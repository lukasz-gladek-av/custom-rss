                <p>A really cool parkour game is being delisted from Steam on June 30, but you still have a chance to grab it for dirt cheap. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supermoves/" data-ref-id="5000-612689">Supermoves: World of Parkour</a> is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1959580/Supermoves_World_of_Parkour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale right now for just $0.79</a> ahead of its removal next week.</p><p>Despite being a blast to play, Supermoves has had a bit of a tragic life following its release last year. Based on both critical and Steam review response, Supermoves is a blast, combining Mirror's Edge-inspired freerunning with some cool multiplayer modes. However, the game did not sell particularly well, and developer Makea Games was forced to shut down back in April.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9a0SDDAIds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9a0SDDAIds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tomi Toikka, the founder and former CEO of Makea Games, stated that he has been in negotiations to try to retain control over the Supermoves IP, but to no avail. As he shared in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1959580?emclan=103582791474310960&amp;emgid=803443087671039373" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a final update</a> announcing the delisting, Makea's financing structure apparently prohibits any path for Toikka to keep the game on sale. He wrote, "After shutting down Makea Games, I had hoped I could salvage the game IP to be preserved in another game company, so players could still play the game they own online, and maybe it could see a resurgence in new players one day. But sometimes the cost of doing business is losing something you love."</p><p>As part of the process of removing the game from sale and the restrictions imposed by Makea's liquidation proceedings, Toikka is also shutting down all of Supermoves' multiplayer features. This means that the game can only be played offline, and while there is a single-player mode that will remain fully functional, much of the original game will be rendered unusable.</p><p>Being forced to essentially eliminate a large swath of his own game has, understandably, made Toikka frustrated and upset. "If you care about digital preservation, independent development, or public R&amp;D policy, I hope the fate of Supermoves sparks a wider conversation about how we keep creative work alive, even when the business behind it closes its doors," he wrote. "I'll cherish the time I spent working on the game with the greats at Makea Games forever. I just wish I could have played the game online with my future kids someday."</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the game, grab it as soon as possible, as it'll be gone for good on Monday, June 30. The base game goes for $0.79 right now, and the deluxe edition--which includes some cosmetics as well as a copy of the soundtrack--is available for $2.43.</p>

                <p>If you're craving some FPS gaming this summer, you'll want to check out Humble's latest bundle deal, the 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle. The deal lets you grab each mainline entry in the BioShock and Mafia series on PC for just $18. Like other Humble Bundle deals, the company donates a portion of proceeds to charity--in this case, the bundle supports Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, immediate crisis care, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. You can also adjust the revenue split between Humble, 2K, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle offers a tiered payment option, and the more you pay, the more games you get.</p><p dir="ltr">If you only want the Bioshock series, you can grab the base $10 tier that includes the Remastered Editions of BioShock 1 and 2, alongside the original BioShock Infinite. The enhanced editions of Bioshock 1 and 2 included in this bundle offer improved graphics and UI, with support for up to 4K resolutions. It's also worth noting that the version of Bioshock Infinite included in the bundle does not include the Season Pass DLC content, and must be purchased separately.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $18 or more, you'll also unlock the Definitive Edition versions of Mafia, Mafia II, and Mafia III. All three Definitive Editions feature upgraded graphics, as well as all story DLC and additional content from the original versions. Owning all three also unlocks bonus in-game costumes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522700"></a><figcaption>Humble's 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4522700-4522023-mafia-bioshock.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While all six games in the bundle are first-person shooters, BioShock and Mafia offer very different gameplay experiences. The BioShock series is a more cramped, atmospheric series set in fantastical alternate-history worlds. The original BioShock was a huge hit when it first released, thanks to its solid gunplay, improvisational combat abilities, and unique, deep-sea steampunk setting of Rapture City. Bioshock 2 returns players to Rapture, and casts them as one of the first game's most intimidating enemies, the Big Daddy. BioShock Infinite breaks away from the underwater adventures of the previous two games and sends players to Columbia, an airborne city of miracles with dark secrets.</p><p dir="ltr">Mafia, on the other hand, are open-world crime thrillers, each of which takes place in a different historical era. The first Mafia game is set during the 1930s in Illinois, Mafia II spans the 1940s and 1950s in New York, and Mafia III takes place in Louisiana during the late 1960s.</p><p dir="ltr">The 2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle is available at Humble until July 9. All games purchased in the bundle are delivered as official Steam keys.</p><h2>2K Classic Trilogies Mafia X Bioshock Game Bundle</h2><h3>Pay at least $10</h3><ul><li>BioShock Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock 2 Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock Infinite</li></ul><h3>Pay at least $18</h3><ul><li>BioShock Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock 2 Remastered Edition</li><li>BioShock Infinite</li><li>Mafia Definitive Edition</li><li>Mafia 2 Definitive Edition</li><li>Mafia 3 Definitive Edition</li></ul><p>If you're looking for more PC game deals, Humble also has plenty of other bundles available right now.

It also includes some bug fixes, tweaks, and improvements, such as a change to how stamina is consumed while skateboarding.</p><p>The off-road skateboard is added to the inventory on sale at the Shred Shack, where it'll cost you $1,500. While minor in the grand scheme of things, it lets you live out your mountain-boarding dreams. If you're of a certain age, it might even let you reminisce about the mountain-board levels in Rocket Power: Beach Bandits for the PS2.</p><p>This patch also tweaks a couple of other skateboarding-related things. First, the developer notes that it implemented some minor changes for skateboard animations. Second, stamina consumption while on a skateboard has changed from instantaneous to gradual, which will likely smooth out the skateboarding experience.</p><p>Other bug fixes and changes include fixing instances where players could not knock on certain doors, reducing stamina consumption while pushing on a skateboard, and improving some pricing issues. You can read all of the changes in the patch notes below.</p><p>Developer TVGS has recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-schedule-1-update-content-will-be-decided-by-players/1100-6532269/" data-ref-id="1100-6532269">big content updates will be decided on the basis of player input</a>, and that a first major update is coming soon.</p><h3>Schedule I version 0.3.6f6</h3><h4>Additions</h4><ul><li>Added off-road skateboard</li></ul><h4>Tweaks/Improvements</h4><ul><li>Skateboard stamina consumption is now gradual rather than instant.Tweaked some IK constraints for skateboard animations.</li></ul><h4>Bug fixes</h4><ul><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the door of the tall brick building next to the overpass.</li><li>Fixed not being able to knock on the doors of the blue apartment building.</li><li>Fixed skateboard pushing consuming excessive stamina.</li><li>Fixed mis-indexed loading bays at the docks warehouse.</li><li>Fixed broken font at the French restaurant.</li><li>Fixed customers accepting unpackaged product, even when displayed success chance is 1%.</li><li>Fixed the packaging station Mk2 being slower to use for NPCs compared to Mk1.</li><li>Fixed Salvador coca seed pricing.</li><li>Fixed a networth calculation bug.</li><li>Fixed a random generation bug causing 'Aspen Death' to be a very common output.</li><li>Modified the pawn shop's pricing algorithm to be a bit less predictable.</li></ul>

                <p>Details about new multiplayer modes for the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 may have been inadvertently leaked. One of the companies involved in development on Black Ops 7 accidentally posted information about a developer-only playtest in the Xbox Call of Duty app, potentially giving a glimpse at what players can expect from the next Call of Duty title.</p><p>First <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported</a> by CharlieIntel, someone apparently set a bunch of images and message of the day cards public for an internal playtest that is scheduled for this weekend. This revealed a number of in-progress multiplayer modes that were apparently meant to be part of the test.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1938388207755829532/" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>NEW Black Ops 7 modes: </p><p>Skirmish: 20v20 | Two teams of 20 fight to complete objectives across a large map.</p><p>Overload: Two teams of 6 players each fight to control a neutral EMP device that must be delivered to the enemy HO for score.</p><p>(via Xbox Call of Duty app) <a href="https://t.co/79EIBY3YkH" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/79EIBY3YkH</a></p></div>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1938388207755829532?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>One of these, Skirmish, involves 20v20 battles that seems to feature wingsuit flight as a key component of gameplay. The mode's description reads: "Two teams of 20 fight to compete objectives across a large map. Capture points of interest, destroy payloads, and transmit valuable data to score. Use your wingsuit to flank and reach objectives before your enemy. The first team to reach the score limit wins." </p><p>The leaked details also revealed a game mode called Overload, which seems to be similar to Halo's old Neutral Assault game mode. Two teams fight over an EMP device and attempt to escort it to the opposing team's base for detonation. </p><p>Black Ops 7 is in development at Treyarch and Raven Software, and it was announced earlier this month at Summer Game Fest. Its reveal came as a bit of a surprise to many Call of Duty fans, as it marks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">the first time that the Black Ops series has had consecutive releases</a>.
