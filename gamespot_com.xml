                <p>Microsoft has been bringing more of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games to PlayStation 5</a>, but one major title still missing from the list is Bethesda's Starfield. For PS5 players that were hoping to play Starfield on the console this year, that won't be happening just yet.</p><p>However, that may change next spring, a new rumor suggests. According to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/starfield-ps5-release-planned-for-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, sources familiar with the situation indicate that Starfield won't be released on PS5 in 2025. One of the reasons is the lower-than-expected performance of its first expansion, Shattered Space. Microsoft is now looking at a Spring 2026 release for the PS5 version, possibly alongside the game's second expansion and a set of quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>Although it hasn't been officially announced for PS5 yet, Microsoft's recent push toward releasing more games on multiple platforms suggests it's only a matter of time. The company has made it clear that it's open to expanding its reach, so Starfield coming to PS5 seems inevitable--even if the exact timing is still uncertain.</p><p>The next Xbox game heading to PS5 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/three-big-xbox-published-games-are-getting-ps5-exclusive-physical-editions/1100-6532423/" data-ref-id="1100-6532423">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>, set for release on August 26. Other titles likely to follow--still unconfirmed--include Gears of War: E‑Day and State of Decay 3, based on similar <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-collection-set-for-ps5-this-year-e-day-releasing-in-2026-report/1100-6529840/" data-ref-id="1100-6529840">reports</a>. While Starfield’s first expansion <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received mixed reviews</a>, the base game still earned mostly favorable grades. GameSpot <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">praised its scale and side quests</a> but criticized its shallow RPG systems and overall polish.</p>

Once that's done, you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced at the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-everything-we-learned-about-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-features/2900-6835/">multiplayer reveal event</a>, anyone who managed to sign up for Battlefield Labs before July 31 is eligible for early access. This grants access on August 7-8, ahead of the first open beta weekend on August 9-10. </p><p dir="ltr">Don't worry, if you didn't manage to sign up for Battlefield Labs, which is currently closed to any further sign-ups, the upcoming beta is open to everyone.

For the unfamiliar, this simply means that you can opt between the classic Battlefield experience where weapons are locked to certain classes or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 lands on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10, and this entry not only marks the series' return to a modern era, but the first time in years that a Battlefield game will be releasing around the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-and-battlefield-are-getting-new-games-in-the-same-year-for-the-first-time-since-2021/1100-6533628/">same time as its most direct competitor</a>, Call of Duty.</p>

                <p>An official Blizzard forum post has warned players of the perils of buying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> gold from a third party. However, Blizzard's reminder that you can instead buy gold officially hasn't gone over well with some in the WoW community.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW community manager Kaivax recently <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buying-gold-from-third-parties-is-forbidden/2139797" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reminded</a> players that buying gold from a third-party seller puts a user's account at risk of being hacked, and that players should protect their account and help to maintain a fair gaming environment by shunning the practice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Purchasing gold from other players puts your account at risk of being hacked and supports companies that steal accounts, operate bots, and disrupt the game economy," Kaivax states.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying gold from a third-party seller is also against WoW's end user license agreement. Those who do could have that illegally acquired gold removed by Blizzard or have their account permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players should never buy gold from other players with real money," Kaivax states. "Remember--you should only accept gold from players that you know, or through crafting or profession agreements made using in-game chat. Always avoid gold trades intended to cross game variants, realms, or factions that are not explicitly supported by the game."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fairly standard account-safety PSA that isn't out of the ordinary. But it's the last sentence of the post that has riled up some in the WoW community on places like the forums and on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-wants-players-to-remember-the-wow-token-is-the-only-safe-way-to-buy-377946#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, as Blizzard goes from offering information players can use to protect their account to what comes across as Blizzard trying to sell a product.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only safe way to purchase gold is via the WoW Token, which provides a convenient and sanctioned exchange of gold for game time or Battle.net balance directly through the in-game auction house," the forum post concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard introduced the WoW Token back in 2015 as part of the game's Warlords of Draenor expansion. A player can buy a WoW Token directly from Blizzard for $20. That token can then be sold on the game's auction house in exchange for gold. The player buying the token can then use that token to pay for 30 days of game time or add it to their Battle.net balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The post has ruffled feathers for a few reasons. For starters, it comes off as an advertisement for the WoW Token, which has long been a controversial addition to the MMO. In recent years the WoW community has argued whether the fact that players can officially buy as much gold as they want from Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-cant-decide-whether-or-not-the-game-is-pay-to-win/1100-6494862/" data-ref-id="1100-6494862">makes the game "pay-to-win."</a> Money, as they say, is power, and with unlimited gold a player can buy many of the best items, rare mounts, or pay other players to run them through content in order to reap lucrative rewards. Blizzard isn't selling players power directly, but they are in a roundabout way by letting players buy gold instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players would like to see the WoW Token removed entirely. Others would like to see Blizzard do more to combat bots and account-scammers outside of offering its own, legally sanctioned way to buy gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Another issue is that, as many in the replies to the forum post point out, some players are unable to buy the WoW Token in their region or in their preferred version of WoW. Some players on the forums state they play in Brazil and have no way to buy the WoW Token, as it's not supported in the country, while others state they play one of the many versions of WoW Classic, which don't support the WoW Token. Blizzard's post encouraging players to buy gold officially, despite many being unable to do so due to where they live or the version of WoW they play, comes across as tone deaf to some.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does regularly ban bots, and even occasionally makes in-game changes to make botting more difficult. In 2023, it banned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-is-making-it-harder-to-create-death-knights/1100-6512418/" data-ref-id="1100-6512418">120,000 "malicious accounts"</a> that were using the ability to make high-level Death Knight characters in Wrath of the Lich King Classic for botting, and added restrictions to new accounts to prevent them from doing so. At the time, Blizzard said it regularly bans tens of thousands of accounts per week.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, will be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>. The expansion will introduce the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">player housing feature</a> to the MMO.</p>

                <p>The Sims 4 keeps on chugging along after more than a decade, and all the signs from the powers-that-be at Electronic Arts indicate nothing will change on that front any time soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> is here to stay, and if EA ever decides to move on to a Sims 5, it won't be in the foreseeable future--a point that was made pretty explicit by Laura Miele, who serves as EA's boss of non-sports games, in a chat with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>.</p><p>"What I wouldn't want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years," Miele told the trade publication. "We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on The Sims 4, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community."</p><p>Instead of replacing The Sims 4, EA will build on the existing foundation and expand the greater Sims ecosystem with the multiplayer-focused Project Rene and other projects.</p><p>"What we’re doing is upgrading and refreshing all this technology, and we’ll be adding modes of play — but we also are going to be creating and updating the base technology and the base user experience on the core game," Miele said.</p><p>"So you’re going to have this life simulation, you’re going to have multiplayer capabilities, we are going to have mobile expressions of this. We’re doing cozy games as well and more to come on that. We did a release with Nintendo on cozy games in Asia for The Sims. I see The Sims as a significant ecosystem, and a universe of multiple Sims experiences that we have to build on."</p><p>It's the bit about "upgrading and refreshing all this technology" that will likely have long-term Sims 4 players talking the most. There's a reason folks have been clamoring for a proper new Sims game despite knowing full well that a new full title would restart the DLC cycle and render <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">all their mods</a> defunct--they want The Sims 5 because The Sims 4 has been out for 11 years and feels very antiquated even with the regular updates. Perhaps this comment indicates that a dramatic overhaul of The Sims 4's foundation could be in the works.</p>
