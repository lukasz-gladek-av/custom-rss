                <p dir="ltr">More than a decade has passed since Silent Hill's last mainline entry--not counting Bloober Team's superb remake of Silent Hill 2 in 2024--but at long last, a new chapter in the franchise is on the way in the form of Silent F. A brand-new mainline entry from a studio in Japan comprised of several survival-horror veterans, Silent Hill F will be the first game in the series to skip the nightmarish streets of Maine in the USA for a terrifying trip to Japan. Here's everything we know about Silent Hill F so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Silent_Hill_F_be_released_">When will Silent Hill F be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Silent_Hill_F">Preorder Silent Hill F</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_platforms">Silent Hill F platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_dev_team">Silent Hill F dev team</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_trailer_information">Silent Hill F trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_screenshots">Silent Hill F screenshots</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_story__setting__and_characters">Silent Hill F story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Silent_Hill_F_gameplay">Silent Hill F gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Why_is_it_called_Silent_Hill_F_">Why is it called Silent Hill F?</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Silent_Hill_F_be_released_">When will Silent Hill F be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">There's no solid release date yet for Silent Hill F, but the game is currently available to preorder in both digital and physical formats. Typically, that suggests a release date is near, and we wouldn't be surprised if the game arrives later in 2025.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Silent_Hill_F">Preorder Silent Hill F</h2><p dir="ltr">Preorder bonuses or special editions for Silent Hill F have not been revealed yet, but the standard edition of the game is currently available to preorder for $70.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_platforms">Silent Hill F platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As for platforms, Konami has confirmed that Silent Hill F will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Unlike the Silent Hill 2 remake, which launched as a timed PlayStation exclusive, no such stipulation has been mentioned yet for Silent Hill F. For now, we'd bet it's coming to all major platforms at once, perhaps with the exception of Switch, which is proving less capable of handling current-gen games as time goes on. We also don't know if it'll be available for Switch 2, but with the console coming out this year, we might be in for a spooky surprise.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_dev_team">Silent Hill F dev team</h2><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill F comes from Neobards Entertainment, a team that has largely been a support studio in the past. The studio has worked on several Capcom games, including Resident Evil 2, 3, 7, and ReVerse, the multiplayer mode tied to Resident Evil Village, as well as titles like Marvel's Avengers and No Straight Roads.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the team has only lent a hand to horror games in its past portfolio, there's reason to believe it's ready to take the next step and lead the development of a major sequel. The game's story will be penned by famed Japanese writer Ryukishi07, the author of the acclaimed When They Cry visual novel series. Additionally, Motoi Okamoto, who previously worked at Nintendo from 1998 to 2007, has been named a producer on the project.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_trailer_information">Silent Hill F

In the video below, which notably does not include imagery taken from the game itself, we see a Japanese village blanketed in fog. Following that, we see what looks like a student standing by a roadside memorial of some kind. As the trailer jumps around between different scenes, it morphs into what may be the Otherworld, a twisted reflection of the safer world the characters in Silent Hill games usually start in.</p><p dir="ltr">As piano music plays and the world rapidly decays, a young woman, seemingly a different one than that who was mourning, runs for her life from an unseen threat. The trailer then cuts to a girl--it's unclear if it's a third one or one of the others shown before--as she moves across still, foggy waters atop a float made of vibrant flowers. The flowers grow from her head and vaguely recall Midsommar's fateful final moments, though it arguably surpasses that grotesque final scene with one of its own: The girl's face peels off her head like a sticker that's no longer adhesive. Yuck.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a long wait for a new look at the game, but at long last, we got a fresh trailer in March 2025. This preview of the game showed off more of the game's Japanese setting, its protagonist, and hinted at some of the monsters that players will encounter along the way.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_screenshots">Silent Hill F screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467200"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill F's protagonist, Hinako Shimizu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467200-silenthillf%282%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467201,1300-4467202,1300-4467203,1300-4467204,1300-4467205,1300-4467206,1300-4467207,1300-4467208" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467201-silenthillf%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467202-silenthillf%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467203-silenthillf%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467204-silenthillf%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467205-silenthillf%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467206-silenthillf%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467207-silenthillf%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4467208-silenthillf%289%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_story__setting__and_characters">Silent Hill F story, setting, and characters</h2><p dir="ltr">So far, what we know about SIlent Hill F is that it takes place in the Japanese town of Ebisugaoka during the 1960s and stars high school student Hinako Shimizu as the protagonist. Everything is fine and dandy in Ebisugaoka--which happens to be based on a real-life town called<a href="https://x.com/sinonomeimori/status/1900378983189143867?" rel="nofollow"> Kanayama in Japan's Gifu Prefecture</a>--until it is covered in a strange mist that introduces monsters and body-warping horror to the streets. The March 2025 trailer showed off some of the terror that Hinako will encounter, as well as the shrines that appear to be safe spaces where you can catch your breath.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill games also deal with psychological trauma, and the trailer hinted at this with a cryptic voiceover about friendship and betrayal. It's also worth noting that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-includes-disclaimer-about-gender-discrimination-and-child-abuse/1100-6530126/"> Silent Hill F will touch on sensitive and potentially upsetting topics</a>, something that Konami has cautioned people about ahead of the game's release. According to the publisher, depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence will be present in Silent Hill F.</p><p dir="ltr">"This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved," Konami said. "If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Silent_Hill_F_gameplay">Silent Hill F gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">We haven't seen any proper gameplay deep dives for Silent Hill F yet, but we do know that the game will feature elements that will be familiar to Silent Hill fans, like survival-horror, puzzles, and even combat--although we're imagining that this will be of the fight-or-flight variety with some of the monsters we've seen so far.</p><p dir="ltr">"Shimizu Hinako was living her life as an ordinary teenager,"<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/"> the official description for Silent Hill F reads</a>. "That is, until her town is suddenly shrouded in fog and begins to change in a horrific way. Now, she must explore a town she no longer recognizes while solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and doing everything she can to survive--in order to face the ultimate decision that she must make. This is a tale about a beautiful yet terrifying choice."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to<a href="https://za.ign.com/silent-hill-f/206915/news/silent-hill-transmission-march-2025-everything-announced-and-revealed-for-silent-hill-f" rel="nofollow"> IGN</a>, creature &amp; character designer<a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Kera" rel="nofollow"> Kera</a> also teased monster and location designs that will emphasize a grotesque beauty in the game. "I love the Silent Hill series, and it's been a big influence on me," Kera said. "In particular, I am constantly remembering Silent Hill 2, and the messages on the walls, the music, and the monster designs. So, when it came to Silent Hill F, and bringing the setting to Japan, we had to come up with something that felt just a little different, and I had to really think about how to get that feeling.</p><p dir="ltr">The monster designs were the hardest. I had to consider everything that's come in Silent Hill before, and figure out how to take this game in a different direction, but still be Silent Hill. It might not be the exact same blood-smeared, rusting scenery, but I sincerely hope you'll enjoy our vision and the world we've created."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_is_it_called_Silent_Hill_F_">Why is it called Silent Hill F?</h2><p dir="ltr">The weird name given to this project does not appear to be a working title. Instead, it may be a reference to sheet music, as the F, or more accurately, "f," as it's styled in the game's logo, is the symbol for forte, which means loud. Musicians can use this symbol in their sheet music to denote that a section ought to be played loudly. Given the creeping piano music that builds in tempo and volume as the trailer goes on, it may be that the story involves music, or perhaps even stars a musician--maybe the girl mourning in the beginning of the trailer goes to a school for aspiring musicians.</p><p dir="ltr">There's seemingly something musical going on here, though it'll take some time before we can piece it together better.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake launches on Nintendo Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC later this year. The new game features ground-up remakes of the first two Dragon Quest games in one package; and just like 2024's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, they will feature new "HD-2D" visuals, re-recorded soundtracks, updated gameplay, and even new content to flesh out both adventures. While Square Enix hasn't confirmed the release date (or even the final box art), preorders for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake</a> are already live at Amazon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No preorder bonuses have been announced for Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake, but we'll update this section if that changes.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're wondering why Dragon Quest I + II HD-2D Remake is launching a year after the Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, it's because Dragon Quest III is a prequel story that takes place before the first two games, and all three make up what is known as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F2NZ8LKV,B0F2P6LNLM,B0F2NX9G77,B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Erdrick Trilogy."</a> These are some of the few Dragon Quest games with overt connections in their storylines, but while III is a prequel, each game takes place hundreds of years apart, so you don't necessarily have to play III first (the original version released after the first two, after all). Nevertheless, if you're itching to play some classic Dragon Quest and want to experience the trilogy's in-game saga chronologically, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a></strong> is worth picking up--and as luck would have it, you can pick up physical copies on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox Series X for just $50 (was $60).</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that the latest mainline entry in the series, Dragon Quest 11, also calls back to the original trilogy in multiple ways--though we won't spoil the specifics. If you're curious to see how everything connects or feel like playing a more modern take on the Dragon Quest RPG formula, you can grab <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D71SHR5B,B0D71JQXR4,B0D71HX7PY&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest XI S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</a> on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC--and PC players can even grab it for <strong>50% off at Green Man Gaming. </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Several other <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fsearch%3Fquery%3DDragon%2520Quest&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest games are on sale at Green Man Gaming</a>, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgreenmangaming.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F1219987%2F15105%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.greenmangaming.com%2Fgames%2Fdragon-quest-builders-2-pc%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preorders-are-live-at-amazon%2F1100-6530455%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a>, which take place in alternate timelines that explore the "bad" endings of Dragon Quest 1 and 2, respectively.

                <p>Call of Duty's popular Nuketown map has been reimagined over and over again throughout the series, and the latest evolution of the map--focused on the stoner holiday of 4/20--has now been revealed. Activision also announced a variety of other extras coming to Black Ops 6 themed around marijuana.</p><p>The new Nuketown variant is called "Blazetown," and it'll be available in Black Ops 6 multiplayer with the Season 3 Reloaded update at some point in the future. It's likely it'll be available by 4/20. Activision has only shared one image of Blazetown, but it does confirm one of the buses is decked out with flower power.</p><p>Also coming to Black Ops 6 to celebrate all things ganja is a limited-time mode called Joint Operations. This includes five core mode variants, all with excellent names: Head Stash (TDM), Inhalation (Domination), Hotbox (Hardpoint), Very High Target (HVT), and Munchies (Kill Confirmed).</p><p>The mode will make you trip out, eliciting "visual hallucinations" and sometimes shifting to a third-person POV to give you an out-of-body experience. The mode also includes double health and low gravity.</p><p>Finally, Activision announced that the popular stoners Jay and Silent Bob are coming to Black Ops 6 as playable characters. Players can deploy using their classic looks or their comic book versions--Bluntman and Chronic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186" data-ratio="0.56111111111111" data-width="720" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467186"></a><figcaption>What a time to be alive.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4467186-screenshot2025-03-28at8.48.56am.png"></figure><p>This DLC bundle includes the "Bluntman Stuntman" Krig C weapon and the "Chronic Unapologetic" Jackal PDW, along with the "Smoke You Out" finishing move, among other 4/20-themed items.</p><p>For more on Season 3, be sure to check out GameSpot's gallery below to see all the new content headed to Black Ops 6 soon.
