                <p>The Borderlands franchise is known for its recurring characters, and perhaps none stand out quite as much as Claptrap. This loud and eccentric little robot has long since stood as the series' mascot for good reason, with his endearing charm and infectious good mood. But there's no denying he can be a bit loud at times--and that certainly hasn't changed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>. But what if you could change that?</p><p>Claptrap may not be as prevalent in this new entry as he has been in some other titles in the looter shooter franchise, but his presence is still consistent enough in Borderlands 4 to warrant a rather unique slider among all the other settings. For those who find this quirky guy more of a nuisance than a lovable goof, Gearbox has added a way to adjust his volume separately from all other volumes. Yeah, you can shut Claptrap up altogether if you want.</p><p>We can sense your excitement, so we'll tell you how to turn down Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4.</p><h2>How to turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4</h2><p>To turn off Claptrap's voice in Borderlands 4, pause the game and head to the "Options" menu. Scroll over one time to "Audio", then select "Advanced". On this menu, scroll to the very bottom to find a setting called "Claptrap?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4570631"></a><figcaption>You can adjust Claptrap's volume to make him more tolerable, or you can reduce it to zero to shut him up entirely.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4570631-199464f90f356-screenshoturl%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, you can adjust Claptrap's voice to make him quieter, or you can decrease the volume to zero so you'll never hear a peep from him again. You'll still be able to read his subtitles so that you know what he's saying when you pick up certain collectibles or engage in quests with him, so you're not really missing anything by turning him all the way down.</p><p>Whether you decide to mute Claptrap is entirely up to you, but don't ever tell him you've taken these measures. He may be slightly annoying sometimes, but the poor little guy doesn't deserve to have his feelings hurt.</p>

                <p>Overwatch 2 developer Blizzard has responded to accusations that new sprays for the competitive hero shooter were created with AI, firmly denying such claims.</p><p>Fans of the game took to platforms such as X and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1nj3hv2/overwatch_artist_using_ai_for_spray_art_creation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, pointing out what they perceived as telltale signs that the sprays depicting cartoony versions of Venture, Juno, and the game's new Hero Wuyang were AI-generated.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968109749507072419" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One user on X</a> cited the "hair and line art" in a spray showing Venture and Juno posing back-to-back, and <a href="https://x.com/DewEnjoyer/status/1968888604727419061" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another user claimed</a> that there were "weird errors and strange details that'd be odd for an industry artist to make," such as one of Juno's eyebrows being over her hair while the other being under.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, a Blizzard spokesperson said: "The sprays referenced are artist-made."</p><p>This is far from the first AI accusation that Blizzard has received relating to Overwatch 2. In August, a post from the official Overwatch X account promoting the brand's collaboration with figurine and plush company Youtooz contained what observers believed to be AI art in the background.</p><p>The post was subsequently deleted, with a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1953595482623947063" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply from the Overwatch account</a> clarifying that the art came from Blizzard's "e-commerce vendor," adding that the company "expect[s] images such as this to be artist-made, in alignment with our policy."</p><p>In April, players accused Blizzard of including AI-generated voice lines in the German localization of the game for Mercy in a Gundam crossover event. A public relations manager for Blizzard <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/overwatch/t/the-new-german-mercy-ai-voice-is-an-outrageous-disgrace/962881/94" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded in the Blizzard forums</a>, denying the accusation and saying that "certain localized voice lines in some recent Blizzard game content are currently unavailable or changed."</p><p>The use of AI in game development still remains a contentious issue, with fans often backlashing at any possible case of AI-generated content, while AAA companies such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-lays-out-plans-for-ai-use-in-gaming-going-forward/1100-6534741/" data-ref-id="1100-6534741">Sony continue to experiment with AI tools</a> such as large language models (LLMs). Back in 2023, reports indicated that Blizzard itself created an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-set-to-unveil-its-own-ai-tool-for-concept-art/1100-6514464/" data-ref-id="1100-6514464">AI tool called Blizzard Diffusion</a> to generate concept art.</p>

People who've never played it probably want a Bloodborne remake. It's safe to say that everyone wants a Bloodborne remake.

At one point, the duo fielded a question from someone seeking speculation about Sony's PC ports, particularly regarding Bloodborne.</p>

Minotti asked of Grubb.</p><p>Minotti noted that Bloodborne can't move because developer From Software must be involved with the project and the studio is busy--presumably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/" data-ref-id="5000-671285">The Duskbloods</a>, and whatever else Hidetaka Miyazaki's scary mind is cooking up. Grubb agreed with this notion, adding that it seems like "[From doesn't] want to do it with Sony." He extrapolated on this point a bit more.</p><p>"Anything beyond From Software would have to be involved and they're not going to do it right now, I don't know," Grubb said. "But that's my understanding of the situation and it continues to be that way. I checked in on it relatively recently and kind of continue to hear, 'Nothing is happening with Bloodborne, so don't expect that.'"</p><p>In confusion, Grubb and Minotti couldn't make sense of why the 2020 remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demons-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-513796">Demon's Souls</a> and the 2022 racing sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gran-turismo-7/" data-ref-id="5000-513781">Gran Turismo 7</a> aren't already on PC. But the one that really tripped them up was a Bloodborne remake, which fans have been clamoring for.</p><p>Bloodborne doesn't need much of an introduction. However, if you can believe it, it's been 10 years since the acclaimed Lovecraftian action-RPG graced our PS4s. Unfortunately, it's been locked on that ancient hardware ever since, with nary a peep about it leaving that vault. Miyazaki has remained tight-lipped about a potential remake for the cult favorite, but he did say in February 2024 that the new hardware--namely, the PS5--could give a theoretical remake some "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/" data-ref-id="1100-6521268">value</a>."</p><p>Although the value proposition Miyazaki proposed as a result of more powerful hardware sounds enticing, what this means in relation to Bloodborne is moot, considering there's been little movement on a port or remake for forever now. While a former PlayStation executive has theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">Miyazaki is likely too busy for a Bloodborne remake</a>--or a remaster or a 60fps update or some kind of morsel--Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/four-years-later-60fps-bloodborne-patch-gets-taken-down-by-sony/1100-6529174/" data-ref-id="1100-6529174">taken action against a fan-made patch</a> that added a higher frame rate to the legendary soulslike.</p><p>It truly does feel like Bloodborne is stuck in a grave, never to be resuscitated ever again. But as the saying goes, never say never. There's no official confirmation; however, you can never rule out the impossible. Maybe Miyazaki and friends are just waiting for the right time, or maybe Sony is looking for Miyazaki to pick the right team. Either way, though there's no movement right now, that doesn't mean there won't ever be movement. Patience is a virtue.</p><p>In other From Soft news, Nightrein just receieved <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-is-about-to-get-harder-for-those-wanting-a-challenge/1100-6534351/" data-ref-id="1100-6534351">a new Deep of Night mode</a> that makes the game even harder than it already was. Yeesh. Good luck out there, Nightfarer.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pokemon Legends Z-A - The Biggest Pokemon Shake Up In Decades!</p>
      </div>
<p>Essentially, Nintendo is claiming that mods are "fair game" as they could be patented by someone else. Thus, the company fears that its gameplay ideas and innovations could similarly be lifted and used by anyone. As IGN noted on September 19, this is particularly worrying for the games industry because patent thieves could theoretically create entire games out of just mods.</p><p>The problem here, though, is that Nintendo's "ideas" and "innovations" aren't novel. Pokemon has been around for decades, and as Games Fray reported, the ideas the company filed patents for in 2021 weren't new, either.</p><p>Pocketpair, for its part, has purported that Palworld and Pokemon are fundamentally different beasts. Sure, they both start with "p," and they feature monsters you can capture in balls, but one is an open-world action game and the other is a more traditionally turn-based affair. This, alongside the notion that Palworld isn't merely a modded Pokemon no matter how much it may look like it, is perhaps why Pocketpair is confused by the lawsuit.</p><p>Palworld is out now on PC, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>Meanwhile, the next Pokemon games are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokopia</a>. The former is a continuation of the Pokemon Legends series that launches on October 16, while the latter is a life sim not unlike an Animal Crossing title that comes out sometime next year. Both will, of course, be available on Nintendo Switch 1 and 2.</p>
