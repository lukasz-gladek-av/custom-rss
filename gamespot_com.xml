She stars in a new promotional video set to her own song "Lifestyle," and the footage shows Lisa holding a PS5 controller as video from popular Sony games like Helldivers II, Marathon, and Astro Bot flash on the screen.</p><p>It's an eye-catching video and a big get for Sony, as Lisa and Blackpink are very popular. She also recently made her acting debut in the newest season of HBO's The White Lotus, playing Mook.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeRQVmVAVzE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NeRQVmVAVzE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lisa is just the latest celebrity that Sony has partnered with to help promote the PlayStation brand, as the company previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-getting-new-controller-console-cover-designed-by-lebron-james/1100-6511941/" data-ref-id="1100-6511941">worked with basketball superstar LeBron James for a variety of accessories designed by the man himself.</a> This was part of the <a href="https://www.sie.com/en/blog/introducing-playstation-playmakers-a-conversation-with-eric-lempel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Playmakers program</a>, which sees PlayStation team up with famous people for a variety of initiatives.</p><p>Others have included actor and comedian King Bach, BMX athlete Nigel Sylvester, WNBA star NaLyssa Smith, NFL players Ja'Marr Chase and CeeDee Lamb, and soccer stars Lisa Zimouche and Romelu Lukaku.</p><p>"We're excited to partner with these Playmakers on an ongoing basis to celebrate their passion for gaming and PlayStation, provide early looks and behind-the-scenes access, and offer unique experiences for fans," Sony's Eric Lempel said.

                <p>Jean Grey aka Phoenix has been rumored to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a> bound for a while, and now it's official. NetEase has confirmed that Phoenix will arrive in Marvel Rivals Season 3 alongside Blade, the popular vampire hunter. But their mutual enemy won't be Dracula or any of the undead. Instead, the heroes of Marvel Rivals will be going up against one of Venom's deadliest foes: Knull, the King in Black and the God of Symbiotes.</p><p>Season 3 is subtitled "The Abyss Awakens," and it's going to launch on July 11. Phoenix will be joining the roster right away, and she will be classified as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-duelist-dps-heroes/2900-6105/" data-ref-id="2900-6105">Duelist</a>. Even without the Phoenix Force, Jean is an immensely powerful telepath and telekinetic mutant. With the Phoenix at her command, Jean is fire and life incarnate, and imbued with the power of creation itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - Season 3: The Abyss Awakens Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Marvel Rivals' new map, Klyntar: Celestial Husk, as a link to the Guardians of the Galaxy's favorite hangout, Knowhere. The entirety of Knowhere was constructed inside the severed head of a dead Celestial. The Celestial Husk is the rest of that Celestial's body.</p><p>In the Marvel Universe, Klyntar was believed to be the homeworld of the Symbiotes. Instead, it turned out to be the place where they imprisoned Knull eons ago. Once Knull is free, he can reclaim control of the Symbiotes and unleash mayhem in the universe.</p><p>Blade is being held back for the second half of Season 3 alongside a new competitive mode, but in the meantime there will be new features, a battle pass, system updates, and four new Team-ups. NetEase is overhauling Marvel Rivals' mission system and adding a new layer of customization to the accessories system.</p><p>NetEase is also offering verified university students free access to costume trials that will rotate each season. For now, this offer is limited to the US, the UK, and a few other places, but more regions will be added later. And going forward, Marvel Rivals will launch a new season every two months.</p><p>Fans heading to San Diego Comic-Con later this month will be able to visit the Marvel Rivals experience at the Marriott Marquis from Thursday, July 24 to Sunday, July 27. On Friday, July 25, Comic-Con will host the Marvel Rivals: Hero Creation from Concept to Showcase panel, with guests, start time, and location to be announced.</p><p>This fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-a-deeper-look-marvel-rivals-visual-style-with-this-new-art-book/1100-6531342/" data-ref-id="1100-6531342">The Art of Marvel Rivals</a> will give fans a behind-the-scenes peak at the creation of the game's character designs and locations. One of the most recent additions to the game's lineup, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adds-ultron-to-the-lineup-in-season-2-5/1100-6531758/" data-ref-id="1100-6531758">Ultron</a>, wasn't announced when Season 2 began. It stands to reason there may be more surprise characters in Season 3 as well.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate</a>, is bringing a whole lot of new gear and activities, along with quality-of-life improvements to how you'll actually play and earn all that stuff. One big change is coming to how you'll earn the new Exotic armors coming to the expansion, at least for a little while, thanks to a new destination activity coming with the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">During its Edge of Fate livestream on July 1, Destiny 2 assistant game director Robbie Stevens mentioned--in pretty vague terms--a new three-player, matchmade destination activity that'll be available in the game's new location, Kepler. Stevens didn't name the activity, instead saying Bungie had hoped its arrival would "surprise and delight" players, but did give a few details about what it'll be like and how it'll work. Most notably, the new activity will offer an opportunity to earn new versions of the new Exotic armor items you can get from completing the expansion's Legendary campaign.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That makes the Kepler activity a reliable way to get specific Exotics, something that has been rare in Destiny 2. Earning the Exotics from the destination activity will give you a chance to grab copies with different distributions of stats, which can be necessary for players looking to perfect their character loadouts. It sounds like you'll still need to complete the expansion's Legendary campaign to get the chance at these additional copies, however.</p><p dir="ltr">Stevens shared a few other details about the new activity as well. While he said it'll be a unique activity, he also likened it to multi-stage destination activities like Wellspring in Savathun's Throne World and Vex Incursion in Neomuna. Both those activities see players fighting hordes at different points around the destination map. According to Stevens, the Kepler activity is "horde mode-inspired," but it'll also have mechanical elements and boss encounters. The activity will also make use of Kepler's new destination abilities. Those include Matterspark, which lets you turn into a ball of Arc energy, Mattermorph, which allows you to use dark matter to move certain objects around, creating pathways and platforms, and Relocator, a big gun that lets you take over Fallen teleporters for your own ends.</p><p dir="ltr">Notably, the Kepler activity is also "technically time-limited," Stevens said. A node will appear on the Kepler destination map to inform players of when the activity will be available so they can farm it, which makes it sound like it'll potentially run for short periods of time before going away, and then coming back again. Stevens said the activity is connected to the story campaign that takes place on Kepler--specifically toward its end--which gives the impression that it won't be available until sometime after the launch of The Edge of Fate, so that players have time to work through the story before jumping into it.</p><p dir="ltr">Check out other details from the Edge of Fate livestream, including info about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">Destiny 2's next raid race</a> and a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">how Matterspark will let you sequence break puzzles</a>.</p>

                <p>The difference between real and generated frames is a hotly contested topic, especially when it comes to their prevalence in PC gaming. Nvidia and AMD have made big improvements to their own solutions for predicting and simulating frames that can be inserted in-between real ones spat out by your GPU, and now Steam is making it a little easier to determine the difference between the two.</p><p>In an update to its in-game performance tools, Valve has added the ability to differentiate between frames generated by your hardware, and ones generated by your pick for frame generation, whether it's Nvidia's DLSS suite or AMD's FSR toolset. A new frames-per-second counter can show you what frame rate you're currently seeing with frame generation on, and what is actually being rendered by the game, which can be useful to determine issues with the technology.</p>

<p>Usually, issues arise with frame generation when your base frame rate isn't high enough, creating a mismatch between the responsiveness of the game and the fluidity you see on-screen. Valve's approach lets you determine if your settings are still a bit too demanding for your hardware by letting you see the true frame rate at a glance, so that you can make adjustments to fine-tune this balance.</p><p>The update also adds more information to the overlay, including additional GPU and CPU utilization information, maximum and minimum frame rates, a frame rate graph, and more. You can choose between four display levels in the in-game overlay settings, as well as the color and opacity of the display to suit the game they're being layered onto.</p><p>Valve says this update is specifically for Windows users now, and for modern GPU hardware. Additional support will come at a later, undetermined date. You can find out more about how Valve calculates all of its performance metrics in the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">detailed breakdown here</a>.</p>

                <p>During a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> livestream for The Edge of Fate, which is set for release on July 15, Bungie developers explained how they expect players to sequence break the new planet of Kepler--and that's intentional.</p><p>The new destination of Kepler is described as being similar in depth to the Rise of Iron content from the original game in 2016. It was complex with many puzzles and mysteries to solve. The Edge of Fate's content has been designed so that the campaign missions "slowly" lead players into unlocking different abilities and the varying levels of them, as well as uncovering more of Kepler's explorable areas.</p><p>There are puzzles to figure out, secrets to unlock, and particular routes that will be inaccessible without using abilities, such as Matterspark, to shrink down and traverse through vents or hidden paths. During the stream, Bungie developers explained that this was done in order to teach players that it's necessary to look at and think about the world around them in a different way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After the main campaign story missions are complete, you can unlock abilities anywhere, but this means that you can sequence break puzzles and missions. Bungie says that this is "entirely intentional" and that it is looking forward to seeing what players can do beyond the limits of its own playtesting processes.</p><p>"We're not 100% sure where players might sequence break," said Destiny 2 assistant game director, Robbie Stevens, "but that's intentional."</p><p>With the news that players breaking Destiny 2 is finally intended by Bungie, it'll be interesting to watch the varied combinations and broken builds created by players in action.</p><p>Where Bungie draws a stricter line though is its raids, with many items and abilities being disabled for the Contest Mode versions of its raid races. During the stream, Bungie also announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid race start date</a>, and detailed the new Epic raid system that will be available shortly after its release.</p>

                <p>In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2 </a>developer livestream, Bungie has detailed the start date for The Edge of Fate raid race, and it may signal some changes to the traditional raid race experience that players are used to.</p><p>For the past few expansions, Guardians have had 48 hours to complete the raid race on Contest Mode. Contest Mode is a time-limited version of the race that is available as soon as the raid is released. It has inflated difficulty in the form of reduced outgoing damage, higher combatant health, and a reliance on flawless team communication and strategy. These traditionally began on the Friday following the release of the expansion on Tuesday, but this time around that's changing.</p><p><strong>The Edge of Fate raid race will begin on Saturday, July 19</strong>.</p><p>We assume that it will still begin at the daily reset time, but this has not been confirmed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LFBTFpWYVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, several weeks after the raid's initial release, a new version of the raid will become available. This is known as an Epic version of the raid and will expand the story, adding new content. Bungie emphasized that it is not holding anything back in the base version of the raid to enable the Epic version to exist, but rather that the Epic raid will "enhance" the raid experience.</p><p>For those wondering about how to prepare for the race in the four short days between the expansion's release and the launch of the raid, Bungie recommends completing the campaign's main story on Legendary difficulty to reach the recommended Power level.</p><p>Guardians can further enhance their preparation by grinding for more powerful gear, which can drop at higher tiers with more benefits when completing difficult activities. With the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">new Exotics</a>, armor, and modifiers, this raid race will be one to watch.</p>

                <p>Last week, Fortnite Festival had its first-ever week in which only one new jam track hit the shop, which sent Festival players into a tizzy over the possibility that Epic is winding down support for the mode like the company did last year with Rocket Racing. On Tuesday, Epic lent some credibility to those concerns by once again announcing only one new jam track for the week.</p><p>This week's new track is at least a famous one, Old Town Road (Remix) by Lil Nas X featuring Billy Ray Cyrus--one of the biggest hits of the 21st Century. Last week's lone track, by contrast, was the EDM track Slay! by Eternxlkz. Typically, Festival has had three or more songs each week since it launched in December 2023, and so dedicated fans have been extremely worried about what this change in procedure means--there's a lot of despair going around on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteFestival/hot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Festival Reddit</a>, where the top six threads are currently about this. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteFestival/comments/1lp2i9k/one_song_i_dont_know_why/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteFestival/comments/1lp2rr8/looks_like_epic_is_losing_hope_in_festival_sadly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteFestival/comments/1lp4uqq/ok_i_really_want_to_believe_this/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>This is just the most recent concerning piece of news for Festival fans this year. Before this year, all Fortnite Festival jam tracks were in the shop at the same time, meaning you could buy any song at any time--but during this past spring, Epic removed most of the tracks from the shop and shifted them to a FOMO-driven model like everything else in the item shop, where the available tracks rotate regularly and only stick around for a few days at a time. </p><p>Despite all that, Fortnite Festival did just bring out Bruno Mars as its new seasonal headliner with ABC by the Jackson 5 on the Music Pass, and most Epic employees are off work on the company's summer break. Perhaps the situation will change later in the month.</p>
