                <p>Out of nowhere, developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots shadow-released the extreme sports game Descenders Next today, July 21, and it's included with Xbox Game Pass. The game was originally scheduled to launch in April before being quietly delayed at the last minute.</p><p>Alternatively, you can buy Descenders Next outright on Steam and Xbox for $30 USD. There is no word yet on PlayStation or Switch release dates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE11hzKkErQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fE11hzKkErQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Descenders Next is out now with snowboarding and mountainboarding, with other sports to be added later on. No More Robots says the game aims to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</p><p>After the original Descenders reached 35 million players, Descenders Next builds upon that foundation but extends the series to sports beyond just downhill biking.</p><p>Descenders Next features online multiplayer, large biomes to explore, and progression-based unlockable content. "The parks in particular provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next's playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you'll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you'll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>The music in Descenders Next was done by Monstercat.

                <p dir="ltr">It's looking more likely that EA won't be the only company bringing back college basketball to video games. A new report states that 2K Sports is reaching out to universities about being included in the game--which will be a standalone release not tied to the popular NBA 2K franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">2K Sports has reportedly contacted power programs Michigan St., Houston, and UCLA about their involvement in the College Hoops 2K revival, per <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2025/07/18/source-2k-sports-talking-with-power-4-teams-for-college-basketball-video-game/" rel="nofollow ">Sports Business Journal</a>. The game is apparently aiming to feature 100 programs, with women's teams represented as well. A <a href="https://x.com/MattBrownEP/status/1944719700304310765" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previous report pointed to 2K proposing college basketball DLC</a> for the NBA 2K series. Then, the company could evaluate a possible standalone release afterward, according to the <a href="https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/858350b0-084e-44c8-a223-f26d66781450/Screenshot_2025-07-12_at_7.10.10_PM.png?t=1752367272" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">obtained document</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of this month, the official NBA 2K account <a href="https://x.com/NBA2K/status/1939805441468342727" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-teases-college-basketball-revival-alongside-eas-new-game/1100-6532867/">a college basketball game was in the works</a>. This came quickly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-college-basketball-game-16-years-after-the-last-one/1100-6532831/">EA officially announced a new college basketball game</a>, although no release window has been revealed quite yet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been 16 years since there was any sort of college basketball video game. College Hoops 2K8 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-hoops-2k9-ejected/1100-6184658/">the last entry in that series</a>, arriving in 2007; meanwhile, NCAA Basketball 10 was the last installment from EA in 2009.</p><p>EA has seen a ton of success with its return to college football, as EA Sports College Football 25 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#20">the No. 2 best-selling game in the US last year</a>. The company followed it up earlier this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/">EA Sports College Football 26</a>.</p>
