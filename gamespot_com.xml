                <p>Rebirth Island has been removed from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Call of Duty: Warzone</a> playlist due to "map-specific issues," just hours after the popular map returned. Players are waiting on further updates from Treyarch to find out when the map is likely to be returned to rotation.</p><p>It's a busy time for Warzone, after its big integration with Black Ops 6 and Season 1 launch last week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-patch-notes-anti-cheat-and-weapon-changes/2900-5947/" data-ref-id="2900-5947">The update</a> brought Black Ops 6 operators, weapons, and even game features to Warzone, as well as the new Area 99 Resurgence map, however the integration hasn't been without its hiccups. Players have experienced issues, especially with game audio, as well as with performance on PC.</p><p>Players might have been looking forward to playing the popular Rebirth Island map when it was re-added to Warzone with this week's playlist refresh, but the map was pulled from rotation just over three hours after it was added.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Warzone</a> <br>We've removed Rebirth Island from the playlist while we investigate map-specific issues. Other maps and modes remain unaffected.<br>We will post updates here when we have more to share.</p>  — Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1858619592190685225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Treyarch has said that the issue in question is map-specific, and that "other maps and modes remain unaffected." The post said further updates would be posted to the same account, but it's currently unclear how quickly the issue is likely to be addressed.</p><p>The Warzone developer has already been hard at work patching issues associated with the Season 1 launch, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-patch-notes-detail-several-fixes-return-of-nuketown-24-7/1100-6527802/" data-ref-id="1100-6527802">the first patch</a> coming the day after the season started. Other posts on the CoD Updates X (formerly Twitter) account show that the team has already resolved a number of issues, so hopefully players will be able to jump back into Rebirth Island soon--but for now, they'll have to stick to exploring Area 99.</p>

                <p>The shojo-anime-tinged farming game Fields of Mistria is getting its first major content patch. It includes a new seasonal festival, mounts--including unicorns, llamas, cows, and sheep--and expanded romance routes.</p><p>The updates includes the "Shooting Star Festival," which takes place in-game on Summer 28. Romancable NPCs can be invited to stargaze if you have four or more hearts with them. As for other town-related additions, the renown level cap has been raised to 70, and you'll receive new rewards and new "Crown Requests" after level 50. You can buy more items at Merri's, Vera's, and Louis's market stalls. You can claim new sets and rewards at the museum for the Insect, Archaeology, and Fish wings.</p><p>After repairing Hayden's barn, you can ride mounts (and you'll unlock a set of relevant skills to boot). Skill caps across the board have been raised from 30 to 45. You can also encounter two new monsters in the mines--the Essence Bat and the Mimic--and pick up new rare cosmetic items from them.</p><p>In romance and relationships, you can now raise your affection with romancable NPCs to six hearts. When you do so, you'll unlock new events with them. Additional NPC dialogue has also been added.</p><p>According to the game's roadmap, future updates will include even more festivals, skill and level cap raises, and marriage. You can check out the full patch notes for this update below and on the <a href="https://www.fieldsofmistria.com/post/first-major-update-patch-notes-v0-12-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fields of Mistria website</a>.</p><h2>Full Fields of Mistria v0.12.0 Patch Notes</h2><p>Patch notes will feature a 🌼 emoji whenever the change is based on community feedback and bug reporting!</p><h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3><ul><li>Romanceable’s Six Heart Events have been added.</li><li>Rideable mounts and mount-specific Skill Perks have been added. <em>Note: The “Upgrade Hayden’s Barn” quest must be finished in order to unlock the Mount Questline</em>.</li><li>The Shooting Star Festival on Summer 28 has been added.<em>Note: To experience the date aspect of the festival, the “Beautification Project” quest must be completed.
