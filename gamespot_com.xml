                <p dir="ltr">The director behind Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield was asked to pick the most influential game of all time. Todd Howard decided there are actually two titles that fit that billing: Super Mario Bros. and Doom. But that's not all, as the Bethesda Game Studios executive producer also offered up what he thinks are the two most important titles, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1901709779061420388" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the official BAFTA Games Awards account asked Howard for his selection regarding the most influential game of all time. While the acclaimed developer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/">currently busy with The Elder Scrolls VI</a> (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/">and Fallout 5</a>), he started his response with a small, but intriguing detour. "Well first, I think, the two most important games of all time are Tetris and Pac-Man for what they do for gaming overall and bringing so many people to it," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the actual question, Howard selected Super Mario Bros. and Doom as the most influential games because he sees their DNA in modern games--even three decades later. "Two games where if you trace things games are doing today, you can trace so much of that back to those games," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">Howard most recently served as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-raids-indiana-jones-game-studio-doesnt-get-crushed-by-giant-boulder/1100-6520460/">executive producer on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. He also got to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harrison-ford-pulled-a-john-travolta-at-the-game-awards/1100-6528440/">appear with Harrison Ford on stage at The Game Awards</a> in December. As for Super Mario Bros., it's still one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#2">the top-selling video games of all time</a> after launching on NES in 1985. Meanwhile, Doom came out on PC (specifically MS-DOS) in 1993 and now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hacker-puts-playable-version-of-doom-on-nintendo-alarmo/1100-6527574/">gets hacked onto every device known to mankind</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-bafta-games-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6298/#1">The 21st BAFTA Games Awards</a> will take place April 8, with Senua's Saga: Hellblade II receiving the most nominations with 11.</p>

                <p>In 2024, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Palworld developer Pocketpair on patent infringement claims, and now Palworld's community manager has revealed more details on how it all went down.</p><p>Appearing at GDC 2025 this week, community manager John Buckley said Pocketpair did "legal checks" prior to Palworld's release to try to mitigate a lawsuit risk in Japan, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/it-was-a-very-depressing-day-palworld-community-manager-reveals-studios-reaction-to-nintendo-lawsuit/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a>. Given that, Buckley said the team was confused when Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Pocketpair in Japan.</p><p>"When the lawsuit was announced we were like, 'What?' And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts and asked, 'What's going on?' and that's when we realized it was patents they were going for,'" Buckley said.</p><p>He added that it was a "very depressing day" for Pocketpair when it got sued, adding that developers at Pocketpair are big fans of the Pokemon series.</p><p>"It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version, we were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show, so obviously we had to scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that," Buckley said.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question for the lawsuit are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered on the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD). </a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>Palworld continues to grow, as Pocketpair has just recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">cross-play is coming at the end of March 2025.</a></p>

                <p>Microsoft will soon expand the roster of titles in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">Game Pass Core</a> library, something it rarely does. The cheapest Game Pass tier ($10/month) will add three more games on March 26.</p><p>These include three celebrated games: Batman: Arkham Knight, Monster Sanctuary, and Tunic.</p><p>An evolution of Xbox Live Gold, Game Pass Core grants subscribers access to dozens of games on console, as well as online multiplayer access and member-exclusive discounts. As mentioned, Game Pass Core's game library doesn't get updated very often, making this a notable event.</p><p>Microsoft describes the Core catalog as being "curated," and indeed the three upcoming releases are all pretty highly regarded. There are currently <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games#coreall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 games in the Core catalog</a>, so the upcoming three will push the Core library to 50 titles in all. Game Pass Core is available only on console.</p><p>Some of the other games in the Core catalog include Vampire Survivors, Halo 5, Stardew Valley, Limbo, Hellblade, Fallout 76, Grounded, Firewatch, Dishonored 2, Celeste, and Among Us.</p><p>By comparison, Game Pass Standard ($15/month) includes "hundreds" of games, while Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) includes all of that plus day-one new releases for all first-party games, cloud gaming access, and an EA Play membership.</p><p>As for Game Pass Ultimate, the library grows this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">a bunch more games</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-10-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6327/" data-ref-id="2900-6327">10 games are getting axed soon</a>.</p>
