                <p>ModRetro has announced a relaunch for the Chromatic handheld, its modernized Game Boy. The device quickly sold out last year after it initially launched, and ModRetro says that new stock for it is now available. Alongside the console--which will be available in seven new colors--the company is also debuting new games and accessories for it. Two models will be available--a $200 version with scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass and a $300 version equipped with Sapphire Glass that is designed to be extremely durable.</p><p>The Chromatic library will also expand with five new games, ranging from story-driven adventures to nostalgic re-releases. Sabrina: The Animated Series â€“ Zapped is a re-release of the fast-paced platformer that was based on the cartoon series, Wicked Plague is an old-school metroidvania, and Self-Simulated has over 100 levels to conquer with precision platforming. Rounding out the new arrivals is First Contact Protocol--an adventure-puzzle game with branching choices and cinematic cutscenes--and the puzzle-platformer Gravitorque.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614" data-ratio="0.3734375" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529614"></a><figcaption>The new Chromatic colorway options.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4529614-chromatic-2.jpg"></figure><p>All Chromatic units also come bundled with Tetris, and ModRetro has pledged to provide ongoing support and updates. Streaming support is coming to the Chromatic and no additional hardware will be required to stream gameplay natively to Discord, Mac, and PC. For the new accessories, you can choose from the following extras:</p><ul><li><strong>ModRetro Rechargeable Power Core ($29.99):</strong> A snap-in battery that adds up to 16 hours of gameplay power</li><li><strong>ModRetro Link Cable ($14.99):</strong> Enables couch co-op between Chromatics with head-to-head multiplayer support</li><li><strong>ModRetro Mod Kit ($14.99):</strong> High-quality swappable parts that can be used to customize the Chromatic</li><li><strong>ModRetro Koss Porta Pro ($49.99):</strong> A retro-inspired headset for the Chromatic</li></ul><p>While there are several modern versions of the Game Boy on the market today--most of which provide an emulated experience--the Chromatic is easily one of the best in its class. The $200 handheld console looks and feels like a classic Game Boy, but considering that it makes use of several high-quality parts, it's also an exceptionally well-built handheld overall that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges.</p><p>"ModRetro's Chromatic is a truly superb recreation of the Game Boy Color," Steven Petite wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/">ModRetro Chromatic review</a>. "If you want a near-exact replica of your childhood Game Boy with a backlit screen, this is the handheld for you. At $199, and even if you didn't get a great new spin on Tetris, I'd argue the Chromatic is a bargain due to its ridiculously premium build. But this is a bargain for a <em>very </em>specific type of retro gamer."</p>

                <p>Following a successful four years as a mobile exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-archive/" data-ref-id="5000-527462">Blue Archive </a>released on Steam earlier this month. On face value it seems to have been a successful launch, topping 20,000 concurrent players and 10,000 Steam reviews. However, according to a <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Hd10zoJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">now-removed Nexon forum post</a>, the developer ran an in-game event incentivizing players to leave reviews on Valve's platform, something which is clearly disallowed in the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/reviews" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steamworks documentation</a>.</p><p>The in-game event description explained that once Blue Archive's Steam review count had reached 10,000, all players would receive five Gift Choice Boxes and five Beautiful Bouquets in-game. The event was due to run from July 4-11, but there is no longer any mention of it when opening Blue Archive. Interestingly, the Steam reviews have exceeded Nexon's goal of 10,000. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631" data-ratio="0.635" data-width="2000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529631"></a><figcaption>Blue Archive is facing allegations of ignoring the Steam rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4529631-blue-archive.jpg"></figure><p>As spotted by one user on the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3557620/discussions/0/601909292780678855/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam forums </a>for the game, the Steamworks documentation clearly states that it is not permitted "to abuse or artificially manipulate the review system" nor should anyone "solicit reviews in exchange for any games, DLC, money, or other rewards" with the only exceptions being sending copies of the game to press or creators for previews or reviews. Additionally, developers should not "ask customers to review" games from within the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nexon for comment.</p><p>Blue Archive is a tactical RPG with gacha elements, meaning that it utilizes a random draw system which uses the in-game currency of Pyroxene to determine which students, or characters, players receive. Through limited recruitment events, the "drop" rate of specific students can be raised, incentivizing players to use more Pyroxene to try to get the anime girl they're seeking.</p><p>Blue Archive isn't the only anime girl game trending on Steam right now. Following its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a> is also seeing huge figures, topping 50,000 concurrent players at its peak so far.</p>
