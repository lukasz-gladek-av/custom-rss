                <p>The Executor is one of the six default classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, and it's unlocked automatically for all players after they complete the tutorial. If you've played previous From Software games, especially Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, then you'll immediately recognize the gameplay the Executor utilizes to defeat its foes.</p><p>However, this also means the Executor features a fairly high skill ceiling, requiring players to understand all of its abilities and strengths to use properly. Below, we'll go over the Executor class in its entirety and offer the best build for it in Elden Ring Nightreign. Make sure to also check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">class tier list for Nightreign</a> to see exactly where the Executor falls compared to the other classes.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Executor_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Executor class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Passive_Ability__Tenacity">Passive Ability: Tenacity</a></li><li><a href="#Character_Skill__Suncatcher">Character Skill: Suncatcher</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimate_Art__Aspects_of_the_Crucible">Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Relics_for_the_Executor_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Executor in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</a></li><li><a href="#Golden_Sprout">Golden Sprout</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="Executor_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Executor class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>The Executor is a close-range melee class in Nightreign that uses a katana by default. The class focuses on swift and deadly attacks with the sword to deal massive amounts of damage up close to any enemy. The primary skill for the Executor is Dexterity, as you'll rely on your weapon speed and accuracy to inflict a majority of your damage.</p><p>However, the Executor isn't considered a tanky class, so you also need to dodge and parry enemy attacks to keep your character healthy. Fortunately, the Executor excels when parrying as long as you can predict the timing of your enemy's moves. If you can't get off a parry, then the Executor still has decent stamina to be able to dodge multiple times to get out of trouble.</p><p>You'll find that the Executor can deal some of the most damage out of any class in Nightreign, but you'll have to get extremely close to enemies to inflict that damage. As such, you'll often be at the center of attention when fighting a boss one-on-one, so you need to master attack timing and parrying to be effective with the Executor. Of course, you could also pair it with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-raider-class-guide/1100-6531927/" data-ref-id="1100-6531927">Raider class</a>, which is the primary tank class in Nightreign that can take some of the attention off you as the Executor.</p><p>Overall, the Executor is a high-damage class that is able to take away chunks of health from enemies, but you need to make sure you also play defensively, as you'll be spending a ton of time up close and personal with enemies and bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504148"></a><figcaption>The Executor's abilities in Elden Ring Nightreign</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504148-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.16.36.png"></figure><p>Of course, you'll want to master the different abilities for the Executor as well, which you see below:</p><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Tenacity">Passive Ability: Tenacity</h3><ul><li>Receive boost after recovering from status ailments.</li></ul><p>This passive ability doesn't come into play too often, but when it does, you're extremely thankful it's there. Acquiring a boost when you run through some flowers to relieve you of a status ailment is great for a boss fight that follows, and you can use this to your advantage as well.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Suncatcher">Character Skill: Suncatcher</h3><ul><li>Draw a cursed sword that can deflect enemy attacks.</li></ul><p>This is one of the best character skills in Elden Ring Nightreign, as the Executor is able to wield a huge sword that is terrific for parrying attacks and minimizing any damage you take when fighting up close with an enemy.</p><h3 id="Ultimate_Art__Aspects_of_the_Crucible">Ultimate Art: Aspects of the Crucible</h3><ul><li>Assume the form of the primordial beast.</li></ul><p>When the Aspects of the Crucible ultimate art is activated, you turn into a large wolf-like creature that can tower over most bosses in the game. The form doesn't last overly long, but you can inflict a large amount of damage and cover a ton of ground when the ability is active.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Executor_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Executor in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've briefly gone over the Executor's play style and abilities, it's time to tackle the Relics that you'll want to use for the class. As we mentioned before, the Executor's primary skill is Dexterity, meaning that you'll want to focus on Relics that improve that skill either directly or indirectly. However, you also want Relics that boost your defenses or sword attack power. If you're confused about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relics work in Nightreign</a>, we have a full guide that covers everything about them.</p><p>We'll go over a couple of the key Relics for the Executor below.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><p>The Old Pocketwatch is a Relic you receive for defeating the first expedition boss in Nightreign, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. It's the main way you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duchess-class-guide/1100-6531950/" data-ref-id="1100-6531950">unlock the Duchess class</a>, and while the Old Pocketwatch is intended for that class as a Relic, it's also quite useful for the Executor.</p><p>The Old Pocketwatch grants FP restoration for successive attacks and gives a +3 boost to Dexterity. As long as you're using a weapon like the katana during your runs, you'll make tremendous use of this Relic. If you have the default Executor Urn equipped, though, you won't be able to use the Old Pocketwatch as a Relic, as there's no green Relic Rite slot. However, you can purchase the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar for 1,200 Murk, which comes with red, blue, and green Relic Rite slots. The Old Pocketwatch can slide right into the green slot once you defeat the Tricephalos.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504147"></a><figcaption>Purchasing the Executor's Goblet from the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504147-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-12.22.32.93.png"></figure><h3 id="Golden_Sprout">Golden Sprout</h3><p>Next, you want to unlock and equip the Golden Sprout Relic. You unlock this Relic through the Executor's Remembrance quest in Nightreign, and it can slide into the red Relic Rite slot if you're using the Executor's Goblet.</p><p>The Golden Sprout Relic features three abilities, and they are:</p><ul><li>Slowly restore HP for self and nearby allies when HP is low</li><li>Roaring restores HP while Art is active</li><li><p>HP Recovery From Successful Guarding</p></li></ul><p>All three of these Relic boosts come in extremely clutch when using the Executor. Not only do you get a bonus for successfully playing defensively, but you also receive free HP restoration during your ultimate art and while your HP is low. This pairs nicely with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-healing-flask-charges-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531698/" data-ref-id="1100-6531698">increasing your Healing Flask Charges</a>, which you want to do throughout expeditions to maximize your HP restoration. </p><p>That does it for our Executor class guide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

                <p>Former Rockstar developer Leslie Benzies is launching a new game, MindsEye, in June. Naturally, people are connecting the game to GTA, which Benzies worked on while at Rockstar. Benzies has now reacted to the phenomenon of people comparing MindsEye to GTA, saying it only makes sense, but also asking fans to judge MindsEye for what it is.</p><p>"There's always comparisons, and I think that's how humans work," Benzies told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-leslie-benzies-interview-mindseye-everywhere-and-the-double-edged-sword-of-gta" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "As kids, we're taught to put a triangle into a triangular hole, and a square into a square hole. I think we do that for the rest of our lives, and we like to describe something new as 'it's X plus Y, with a bit of Z in there'. It makes things easy for us. It's maybe humans optimizing the way we communicate."</p><p>These comparisons serve MindsEye and developer Build a Rocket Boy well in some respects and poorly in others, he said. To make his point, Benzies recalled a quote from musician Dave Grohl who said when he formed Foo Fighters that no one cared about the new band; they only cared about Grohl's previous band, Nirvana.</p><p>For MindsEye, Benzies said he hopes fans give the game a fair shake. "The guys have built something very cool, and I just hope people can see it for what it's trying to be," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Benzies said Build a Rocket Boy considered many different options for what would become MindsEye, but making a direct competitor to GTA was never the plan.</p><p>"I'm not sure it would've been smart as a company to say, 'We are going to compete with the biggest game on the planet.' I'm not sure that would be the best business decision to make," he said. "We went through a bunch of different designs, and to tell our story, this is what we landed on."</p><h2><strong>What is MindsEye?</strong></h2><p>So what is MindsEye? And how is it connected to Build a Rocket Boy's Everywhere? Benzies explained that MindsEye is "one story in an epic universe," with this story focusing on the character Jacob Diaz. Other stories will focus on different characters in other periods of time.</p><p>"That's the way we're going to fill out the universe over time--so when you travel around, all the stories will be connected by one overarching theme, and each story will have different mechanics. And we'll give these mechanics to players within the creator tools," Benzies said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s3jVJaFrbM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Benzies said the team has purposefully held back information and footage for "huge parts of the game" to avoid spoilers in a story that will "take some unusual twists."</p><p>"MindsEye sits bang in the middle of our story. So, we're going to go back 10,000 years, then we're going to go forward a certain amount of time. It's the relevant piece of the puzzle that will have players asking questions of what the bigger story is," he said.</p><p>As for Everywhere, this project is "going to show up again pretty soon," Benzies said, and when that happens, the company's wider plans might make more sense.</p><p>"Everything we're working on, there's a story behind it--a big overarching story. So Everywhere will come back, and it fits into this story somewhere. I can't tell you [where], because it would be a spoiler. But that's going to reappear soon, and it will all be a part of the same product," he said.</p><p>In other news, Build a Rocket Boy co-CEO Mark Gerhard has suggested that the bad word of mouth about MindsEye is part of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-claims-theres-a-concerted-effort-to-trash-this-gta-like-game/1100-6531866/" data-ref-id="1100-6531866">"concerted effort" to trash the game and his studio.</a></p><p>MindsEye launches June 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. As for the GTA franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> is set for release in May 2026.</p>

                <p>After nearly a decade of anticipation for the next installment of Dragon Age, the latest sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, unfortunately <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">failed to reach EA's expectations</a>. Subsequently, the game's developer, BioWare, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off staff members</a> and became considerably smaller. Now, one of the voice actors from The Veilguard is sharing her dismay about the backlash against the game from people who she says wanted to see BioWare fail.</p><p>Alix Wilton Regan--who voices the female Inquisitor in both Dragon Age: Inquisition and Dragon Age: The Veilguard--recently told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-star-absolutely-devastated-over-backlash-says-people-wanted-to-see-bioware-fail" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that she loved the game and she suspects that The Veilguard's haters were intentionally trying to bring it down.</p><p>"I feel absolutely devastated for BioWare as a studio that they got such mixed reactions to the game," said Wilton Regan. "I personally thought it was a really strong game. I thought it was just BioWare being more BioWare. I also think a lot of people kind of wanted to see it fail, or wanted to see [BioWare] fail, either because they're just really bad people on the interne--of which there are unfortunately many, as we have discovered... "People were attacking the game before it was released. It's ridiculous. How can you judge a game, a book, a film, a TV show before it's actually released? You can't. It's an idiotic stance to take."</p><p>Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Dragon Age will get a sequel any time soon. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">shifted some of BioWare's developers</a> to other parts of the company, while leaving the remaining devs to tackle the next Mass Effect game. </p><p>EA chalked up The Veilguard's disappointing response to an "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">evolving industry landscape</a>." BioWare wasn't the only developer inside of EA to face layoffs. Earlier this week, EA shuttered Cliffhanger Games and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled the AAA Black Panther game</a> that was in development.</p>

                <p>The Duchess is one of the eight available classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, but it's not one that you'll have unlocked by default at the start of the game. Instead, you have to complete a specific action to unlock the class and start using it on your expeditions.</p><p>Of course, if you already have the Duchess unlocked in Nightreign, then you might be wondering the best way to build out the class. Fortunately, we have you covered on both fronts. You can see our full detailed guide below on how to unlock the Duchess and the best build for it in Nightreign. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">tier list for all eight classes</a> so you can see how the Duchess stacks up to its counterparts.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a></li><li><a href="#Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</a></li><li><a href="#Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</a></li><li><a href="#Ultimate_Art__Finale">Ultimate Art: Finale</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</a><ul><li><a href="#Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</a></li><li><a href="#Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 id="How_to_unlock_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">How to unlock the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>First and foremost, you need to know how to unlock the Duchess if you want to start using the class.</p><p>You won't be able to unlock the Duchess until you defeat the first expedition boss in Nightreign, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-tricephalos-boss-guide-how-to-beat-gladius/1100-6531888/" data-ref-id="1100-6531888">Tricephalos</a>. This is the only major boss you have access to after completing the tutorial, and you can go on the expedition to fight the boss by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-roundtable-hold-guide/2900-6607/" data-ref-id="2900-6607">interacting with the Roundtable Hold's</a> central table.</p><p>After you have defeated the Tricephalos boss, you'll receive an "Old Pocketwatch" as a reward for completing the expedition. This Old Pocketwatch can be used as a Relic at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-relics-in-elden-ring-nightreign/1100-6531727/" data-ref-id="1100-6531727">Relic Rites station</a> in the Roundtable Hold. However, you don't want to make plans with the Old Pocketwatch just yet, as it's the main way to unlock the Duchess class.</p><p>With the Old Pocketwatch in your inventory, go speak with the white-gowned woman who first spoke to you upon arriving at the Roundtable Hold. During the dialogue with the woman, she'll ask you to give her the Old Pocketwatch, as it was hers to begin with. You can either choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it for yourself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504107"></a><figcaption>Choosing to hand over the Old Pocketwatch or keep it. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504107-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.42.30.59.png"></figure><p>You want to choose to hand over the Old Pocketwatch to the woman. Doing this results in the woman trusting you more, causing her to reveal her true identity. The woman is the Duchess herself, and as soon as you hand the watch over, she transforms into the Duchess. You now have full access to the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign, and you also get to keep the Old Pocketwatch as a usable Relic.</p><h2 id="Duchess_class_overview_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Duchess class overview in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>The Duchess is unlike any other class in Nightreign, as she excels in quick combat with fast attacks and speedy movement. However, with this speed, the Duchess doesn't have a ton of HP, so you'll need to use your movement to weave your way in and out of battles to avoid being hit too much. The Duchess's starting weapon is a dagger that can attack extremely quickly, but doesn't do an overwhelming amount of damage per hit.</p><p>Here are all of the Duchess's abilities in Nightreign:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504109"></a><figcaption>All of the Duchess's skills in Elden Ring Nightreign.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504109-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.20-22.46.05.94.png"></figure><h3 id="Passive_Ability__Magnificent_Pose">Passive Ability: Magnificent Pose</h3><ul><li>Attack and dodge optimally, dodging repeatedly when necessary.</li></ul><p>The Duchess's increased movement abilities allow her to dodge over and over, which gives you the ability to avoid damage as much as possible.</p><h3 id="Character_Skill__Restage">Character Skill: Restage</h3><ul><li>Stage reprisal of recent occurrences to damage nearby foes.</li></ul><p>Restage is a fairly decent ability that gives the Duchess a chance to deal damage while not engaging with foes. You can stand back, cast the ability, and watch a phantom deal the same moves that you just dealt to the nearest enemy.</p><h3 id="Ultimate_Art__Finale">Ultimate Art: Finale</h3><ul><li>Obscure self and surrounding allies to hide from foes.</li></ul><p>This is a classic assassin-type skill that the Duchess can use to get out of trouble, sneak past enemies, or turn the aggression of a boss to another character. The Finale skill also obscures your nearby allies, though, so it's important to consider their positioning before casting it.</p><h2 id="Best_Relics_for_the_Duchess_in_Elden_Ring_Nightreign">Best Relics for the Duchess in Elden Ring Nightreign</h2><p>Now that we've gone over how to unlock the Duchess and all of her skills, it's time to build out the class using Relics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504111"></a><figcaption>The Duchess' Goblet can be purchased at the Small Jar Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504111-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.14.38.57.png"></figure><p>For starters, it's best to go to the Small Jar Bazaar and purchase the Duchess' Goblet for 1,200 Murk. This gives you a new set of Relic Rites, which include two orange slots and one green slot. By default, you have access to the Duchess' Urn (two red slots, one blue slot). By swapping to the Duchess' Goblet, you're able to make use of much stronger Relics. You can also eventually upgrade to the Duchess' Chalice.</p><h3 id="Old_Pocketwatch">Old Pocketwatch</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4504110"></a><figcaption>The Old Pocketwatch is one of the best Relics for the Duchess</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4504110-eldenringnightreignscreenshot2025.05.30-11.16.44.19.png"></figure><p>Coincidentally, one of those Relics is the Old Pocketwatch, which is tailor-made for the Duchess. The Old Pocketwatch is a green Relic Rite and has the ability to restore FP upon successive attacks and gives a flat +3 to Dexterity, the main stat the Duchess utilizes.</p><p>The FP restoration after successive attacks is perfect for the Duchess since you can attack multiple times using her default dagger and any other fast weapons you find during an expedition.</p><h3 id="Golden_Dew">Golden Dew</h3><p>The other Relic you want to make sure you equip for the Duchess is the Golden Dew, which is an orange Relic Rite that can slide right alongside the Old Pocketwatch. The Golden Dew Relic is unlocked through the Duchess' Remembrance quest in Nightreign and offers improved Character Skill Attack Power for the Duchess specifically, as well as boosts the attack power of added Affinity Attacks.</p><p>The third Relic slot for the Duchess (using the Goblet) can be filled with other Relics that you earn as rewards while playing as the Duchess. You want to focus on the Dexterity attack, dagger attack power, and bonuses for attacking quickly.</p><p>That does it for our Duchess class guide in Elden Ring Nightreign.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 Season 04 | Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Why these ads were added four seasons into Black Ops 6 instead of earlier (or preferably never) is unclear, but it's easy to see why players aren't exactly thrilled about them. For starters, it's not like the battle pass isn't already featured very prominently, as it has its own dedicated menu tab and there are frequent reminders for players to claim rewards and upgrade to the premium version.</p><p dir="ltr">Ads for weapon blueprints are equally frustrating. If a player hasn't kept up with each season, they may have numerous weapons they need to grind XP for in order to unlock. Buying a weapon blueprint for that weapon, however, unlocks it immediately. It's easy to see these in-game advertisements then as publisher Activision's way of trying to entice players to simply pay for access to new weapons.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Activision has now added Bundle and Battle Pass advertisements to the Create a Class and Events tab with the Season 4 update in Black Ops 6 and Warzone. <a href="https://t.co/4rLvLbWmTe" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4rLvLbWmTe</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty is, of course, no stranger to microtransactions. Black Ops 6 has sold mini-event battle passes and even an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-has-an-option-to-pay-for-better-audio/1100-6527328/" data-ref-id="1100-6527328">option for better audio</a>, and its store is filled with so many weapon and Operator bundles it's hard to keep track. In-game advertisements for those microtransactions sadly feel par for the course, but it's still disappointing nonetheless.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what else is coming as part of Black Ops Season 4, new maps, modes, and weapons are available now, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick Ballerina crossover</a> set to begin later in the season.

While the full patch notes won't be released until next week, the account did tease some important updates coming to solo expeditions in Nightreign. After Patch 1.02, solo players will be able to revive themselves once per night-boss battle and gain more runes (a form of in-game currency) while playing.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The following improvements for solo expeditions will be added to the game:<br>- The effect "Automatic Revival Upon Defeat", which allows revival once per night boss battle, will be added to solo expeditions.<br>- The amount of runes gained will be increased.<br>Thank you for your support.</p>  — ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1928436890924884471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Nightreign remixes the critically acclaimed 2022 game from Dark Souls creator From Software into a more multiplayer-focused experience where players take on tough bosses together. That said, players also have the option of going on these expeditions alone if they really want to, although even GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review/1900-6418368/" data-ref-id="1900-6418368">glowing review of Nightreign</a> admits that "it never feels like it was designed to accommodate a single player."

It's currently unknown if Patch 1.02 will fix any of those performance issues. None of these balance, PC performance, or solo play issues have prevented Nightreign from becoming an instant success, though.

This will be hosted by Geoff Keighley (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/summer-game-conference-schedule-2025/1100-6531627/" data-ref-id="1100-6531627">Summer Game Fest</a>, The Game Awards), and the event will be held inside the Orpheum Theatre. In case you can't make it, this showcase will also be livestreamed.</p><p>In addition to Keighley, Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima will also be present, and there'll be a panel discussion with special guests. An "exclusive" live demonstration of Death Stranding 2 will be held and <a href="https://cvent.me/B14PXm" rel="nofollow ">you can sign up through this link if you're interested in attending</a>.

Death Stranding 2 takes place 11 months after the first game, and the gameplay has been expanded with a day-and-night cycle, natural disasters, and new mechanized enemies that will menace protagonist Sam Porter Bridges. One of the big features from the first game being upgraded for the sequel is the Social Strand System, as you'll be able to grow your reputation and access new gear and resources on your journey.</p><p>In case you missed it, a new marketing campaign in Japan <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/">revealed a brief look at the game</a>, albeit through a Prepper ASMR lens that isn't nearly as exciting as the previous trailer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/">and its tease of Pacific Rim-like fights</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-is-getting-a-limited-edition-dualsense-controller/1100-6531400/">Fans of Death Stranding can also preorder a special DualSense controller</a> right now.</p>
