                <p>Who doesn't love a little DIY arts and crafts project? They're fun, they get you doing something, and most of the time, you'll come out of it with something special, or at least a fun story. Unfortunately, this is the story of one fan's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> project gone horribly wrong, and while it can't be fun for the poor guy at the center of it, watching it unfold sure has been pretty funny.</p><p>Recently, a TikTok user (<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-yellow-spray-paint-cart-1851786727?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Kotaku</a>) by the name of <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung?lang=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gardner</a> shared that they wanted to paint their Switch 2 cartridge of the critically acclaimed 3D platformer yellow. The rationale behind the move is a simple one rooted in nostalgia: Nintendo has previously released Donkey Kong games with banana-yellow cartridges, like Donkey Kong 64, which Gardner flashes on camera as a reference point in the first of two videos.</p><p>I can already hear everyone groaning and screaming at their screens. I was there too, but it's worth it to enjoy the rest of this cringe-inducing ride.</p><p>Gardner then proceeds to crudely pry apart the crimson red Switch 2 cartridge, showing multiple failed approaches before it is finally cracked open. Once it is, they remove the card with the game files on it and take the spray paint can to each half of the cartridge casing. The first video ends as they piece it back together and insert the game in the console only to find it gets stuck about halfway through and can't actually fit back into the slot.</p><p>One comment on the first video reads, "Seems like the paint might melt and stick in the system when it heats up. This feels like a bad idea." If only that commenter knew how right they'd be within just 24 hours.</p><p>To make matters worse, Gardner returned with a second video a day later showing that despite the system's resistance to the painted-over case, they insistently jammed the game in anyways, where it is now irretrievably stuck. They even take a pair of pliers to the system but simply cannot pull it out, instead chipping the yellow paint and even breaking the cartridge. Eventually Gardner relents, hilariously saying, "Without tagging Nintendo, somebody let me know what I should do to get it out of my system. Again, I'm chilling because I'm going to play the game for a while but I'd love your suggestions."</p><p>As you might expect, Gardner's ridiculous journey for a yellow Bananza cartridge has already gone viral. Some chimed in with what they believed to be advice, like multiple comments suggesting they should've just 3D printed a yellow case and reprinted the game's art, but many of the commenters are also just poking fun at Gardner's dedication and misfortune.</p><p>One comment simply reads, "It's NOT THAT SERIOUS," alongside a crying emoji. Another jokes, "Guy buys a Switch 2 with Donkey Kong built in!!!" The most devastating of the bunch simply says, "Is now a bad time to mention it isn't even the right shade of yellow?" Ouch.</p><p>I guess the big takeaway here is that the next time you want to undertake a DIY project with your expensive gaming system, please just ask around the internet before doing a very costly amount of damage. I hope they're really enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza, because that seems to be the only thing that Switch 2 is going to be playing for the foreseeable future.</p>

                <p>Developer 1047 Games has made some drastic announcements about the Splitgate series, confirming today that Splitgate 2 is reverting to beta and the servers for the original Splitgate are going offline.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1947717804364353641" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, the developer's co-founders said they agree with the sentiment from many fans that the game was released into a 1.0 state too soon. "We've heard your feedback, and we agree with you: We launched too early. We had ambitious goals with Splitgate 2, and in our excitement to share it with you, we bit off more than we could chew."</p><p>The studio went on to admit that some features were "rushed" and that the team made some "boneheaded mistakes," which could be a reference to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l8yux9/comment/mx8l8fe/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">overpriced microtransactions</a> or an executive's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-dev-lays-off-staff-co-founders-forgoing-salaries/1100-6532622/" data-ref-id="1100-6532622">wear a certain hat on stage at Summer Game Fest. </a></p><p>"So we're going back to beta. We'll be heads down until early next year, rebuilding major parts of the game to capture the spirit of what made Splitgate special," the developer said.</p><p>Splitgate 2's progression system will be reworked "from he ground up," while maps will get more portals, the monetization systems will be simplified, and the game overall will be refocused on "classic game modes."</p><p>1047 Games said it will conduct playtests, issue surveys, and listen to fan feedback as it seeks to grow and improve on Splitgate 2. "Our goal is to combine the DNA of the first game with the best improvements from the second. Rebuilding the core experience isn't a quick fix; it's a long-term commitment," the developer said.</p><p>Despite what sounds like a major development effort from the part of 1047 Games, the studio is cutting roles. "To give ourselves the time to build the Splitgate you deserve, we've made the incredibly difficult decision to reduce certain roles and shift our resources to focus on this rework," the studio said.</p><p>"This is heartbreaking. These are our teammates and our friends, and they helped build what we have today. They're receiving severance and job placement support, and we're committed to doing everything we can to help them through this transition," the studio added. "We hope to bring them back when we can."</p><p>Additionally, the servers for the original Splitgate are closing as part of an "effort to retain as many team members as possible."</p><p>"While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team," the company explained. "Like us, we know this game means a lot to so many of you, so we are exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches. And when we return, we plan to have a dedicated experience in Splitgate 2 that delivers on the promise of the original."</p><p>Splitgate 2 will remain playable through the rework, and the planned Chapter 3 update is still coming, along with the scheduled fixes and changes.</p><p>"We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible," the developer said. Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up. We love this game, and we love this community too much to ever quit. So we won't."</p>
