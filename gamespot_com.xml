                <p>Late last month, the superhero work comedy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a> was released by AdHoc Studio. Since then the episodic adventure game has sold 1 million copies in its first 10 days, and the fan response has only grown from there. So much so that AdHoc Studio co-founder Pierre Shorette has acknowledged that the game may not be one-and-done after this week's finale.</p><p>Shorette and his fellow co-founder Nick Herman were guests on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPqU5hSVA78" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Friends Per Second</a> podcast (Via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-dispatch-getting-a-second-season-well-thats-something-the-developer-is-definitely-going-to-think-about" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) when a question about Dispatch Season 2 came up.</p><p>"[I think] that we're going to have to at least think about Season 2 now," said Shorette. "That was a question mark three weeks ago, you know. So, it's a very cool problem to have."</p><p>Shorette reiterated that AdHoc already has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">a video game project in the works with Critical Role</a>, which will be set in the fantasy world of Exandria. Critical Role's Travis Willingham has said that the game will feature a brand-new story, but characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells campaigns could appear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EI2S4LITn8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EI2S4LITn8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The final two episodes of Dispatch Season 1 will premiere on November 12. Dispatch hit a new high on Steam last week <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">with over 131,000 concurrent players</a>. It's possible that the finale will carry the game past that benchmark.</p>

                <p>Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7RLpcD_jU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0i7RLpcD_jU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and "wannabe rocker" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.</p><p>Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.</p><p>According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, a game that's gone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">almost two decades without a sequel</a>.</p><p>Agefield High: Rock the School is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> now. Refugium Games estimates that the game will be released in 2026 Q2.</p>

                <p>EA and developer Full Circle have released a new blog post that speaks to feedback since the early access game Skate launched in September, and the developer is not shying away from owning up to some issues.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Full Circle said "a lot more" people than expected turned up to play Skate. "And with that came bugs, glitches, progression locks, and performance issues," the studio said.</p><p>As a thank-you to fans for sticking with Skate, Full Circle is giving everyone 2000 Tix and 500 SVBs. Players must log in to Skate between now and the end of Season 2 on December 2 to claim the freebies.</p><p>As for addressing Skate's ongoing issues and bugs, Full Circle said it has identified key details about the "softlock" issues that are preventing some people from progressing. "Unfortunately, each of these issues is unique and requires a different solution," the team said.</p><p>Full Circle said addressing these softlock issues is a "top priority" for the studio.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Full Circle said it recently delivered a patch that should help with issues related to daily tasks. "You should see fewer errors now," the studio said. "But there still may be a few slip ups."</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle said it continues with its effort to tune the progression and rewards system for players so that "they just feel right."</p><p>"That will mean different things to different players - new players, experienced players, casual players, and to those who skate all day. Rip Chips, Tix, and XP are part of that tuning and it's all a delicate balance. We appreciate your patience as we dial this in to make our in-game economy and reward system fun, fair, and sustainable," the developer said.</p><p>Changes to the progressions system are coming in December with Season 2. Here's a rundown of what's changing, as written by Full Circle:</p><ul><li><strong>Premium item value</strong>: We want you to feel good about what you’re spending your SVB on. So we're working to make Premium items feel even more unique and valuable, and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed.</li><li><strong>skate.Pass tiers:</strong> We're tweaking skate.Pass so it will be less of a grind to complete. You’ll also see more tiers going forward - all future Seasons will have around 90 tiers.</li><li><strong>Earning more SVB through skate.Pass:</strong> We’re increasing the amount of SVBs granted through the combined Standard and Premium tracks of the skate.Pass to 500 SVB.</li><li><strong>More branded and licensed items in skate.Pass:</strong> We’re actively working with our partners to include more branded items in future seasons. While they won’t arrive in time for Season 2, you’ll see an update as soon as we have new items to report.</li><li><strong>Event currency surplus</strong>: Having a surplus of event currency after Skate-o-Ween has been an issue, so, we’re tuning our event economy. You’ll see changes starting with the 7-Ply Maple Harvest event later this month.</li></ul><p>Finally, Full Circle said it "went a bit overboard" with Tix allotments so that some players are "overflowing" with Tix, even after using them to unlock the content they want. To address this, Full Circle said leftover Tix purchased with SVB will roll over to the next season. However, Tix acquired without spending SVB will not totally roll over; instead, only a "portion" of them will. As such, Full Circle said people should spend their Tix to avoid losing some when the next season drops.</p><p>"Let us know how this feels through early access and we'll continue to improve the way we roll over Tix from season to season," the studio said.</p><p>Overall, Full Circle said it promises to make Skate a better game over time during its early access period leading up to 1.0. "We're truly grateful for your patience as we improve, grow, and evolve skate," the studio said.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 and the battle royale game Redsec are getting a new update on November 11, featuring a number of quality-of-life updates and bug fixes. Included in the patch notes is the removal of one of the game's most infamous exploits.</p><p>Update 1.1.1.5 launches on Tuesday, November 11 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET. The biggest change may be the removal of a bug that allows players to stand on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone and ascend into the air by smashing it with a sledgehammer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Riding on top of a drone in this way</a> allows players to access unintended areas and shoot at people from places where foes wouldn't expect, and it's going away soon.</p><p>This has been an ongoing point of frustration for players, who have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1orlew2/patch_the_drone_exploit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made their concerns known for a month now</a> in places like Reddit and elsewhere.</p><p>Another major change in 1.1.1.5 is that Battlefield Studios has fixed a problem where Lock-Guided Missiles would fail to be properly countered by things like flares. Additionally, vehicles would spawn in the wrong places on Breakthrough and Conquest maps, but that should be fixed with this update. As for Redsec changes, the developer said it has fixed multiple "issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and End of Round transitions."</p><p>Battlefield 6 launched at the beginning of October and has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">more than 10 million copies so far.</a> That is a big number but it will not be enough to topple Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when it launches on November 14, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">experts have said.</a></p><p>Redsec, meanwhile, launched on October 28 as a free game supported by microtransactions. The game has a "mixed" user score on Steam, with people complaining about all kinds of things, including the lack of a solo playlist, the microtransactions, and other issues.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint to firing in ADS.</li><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would incorrectly scale with movement speed and always assume the player is moving at maximum movement speed for the stance.</li><li>Tuned landing animation to reduce excessive camera and weapon movement when aiming down sights, improving visual stability during and after landing. This update also resolves instances where the ADS aim could be displaced when sliding.</li></ul><p><strong>VEHICLES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Lock-Guided Missiles did not get countered as expected when met with enemy countermeasures such as flares.</li></ul><p><strong>GADGETS:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS &amp; MODES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where vehicles did not spawn correctly in Breakthrough and Conquest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where matches sometimes would start with all sectors and objectives active at the same time.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Strikepoint on Siege of Cairo where destruction did not reset at halftime.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue in Vehicle Customisation locked Anti-Air Vehicle presets did not display their unlock criteria as intended.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the shotgun weapon challenge “Kill 5 Enemies With a Shotgun Without Reloading” did not complete properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where progress for the “Engineer Specialist 3” Assignment did not save correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>PORTAL:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where “SpawnLoot” would not spawn Ammo or Armor.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players with community creations privileges set to Block could still access user-generated Community Experiences when the party leader hosted a match.</li></ul><p><strong>AUDIO:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where activating the BF PRO Radio Channel through the Commorose did not play any sound.</li></ul><h2><strong>Redsec 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Battle Royale (Quads) matches did not end after the last team was eliminated.</li><li>Fixed an issue where being killed immediately after a mobile respawn completed could result in the squad being eliminated instead of reviving remaining teammates.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could become stuck in a top-down view of the map after redeploying.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players retained their Second Chance after redeploying and did not transition to the End of Round screen after their next elimination.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where all squad members displayed the same highlighted stat on the Squad Placement screen.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the “Battle Royal Master Challenge 4” did not track progress correctly.</li></ul>
