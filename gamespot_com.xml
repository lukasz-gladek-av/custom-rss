                <p>Amazing Seasun has confirmed that an open beta for its multiplayer mecha shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mecha-break/" data-ref-id="5000-612139">Mecha Break</a> will begin on February 23. It will be the most comprehensive one for the game yet, featuring most of what players can expect in Mecha Break at release.</p><p>The Global Storm Open Beta begins at 2 AM PT / 5 AM PT on February 23, while no end date has been confirmed yet. Global Storm will contain the 6v6 Operation Verge and 3v3 Ace Arena modes that have been in previous Mecha Break betas, but it will be the first to feature full cross-play across PC and console and include Mashmak. Mashmak is Mecha Break's PvPvE extraction mode, where teams of players work together or fight each other over an element called Corite.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UbY_bPQ-9I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-UbY_bPQ-9I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mashmak gets its name from the map on which this mode takes place. An evil organization called Theia's Vanguard has taken over the Mashmak Isles and its massive supply of Corite. That serves as the narrative backdrop for why players explore, collect resources, and fight each other before extracting. From a gameplay perspective, Mashmak stands out because players can equip themselves with special mode-exclusive equipment to enhance their suits' abilities.</p><p>Mecha Break will launch for PC and Xbox Series X|S sometime in Spring 2025 before coming to other platforms later in the year. The PC version of this open beta can be pre-loaded <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a> from 2 AM PT / 5 AM ET on February 20.</p>

                <p>During February 12's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6256/" data-ref-id="2900-6256">State of Play</a>, Konami confirmed an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-with-state-of-play-trailer/1100-6529438/" data-ref-id="1100-6529438">August 28 release date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> and teased that the Snake vs. Monkey crossover mode with Ape Escape would return on PS5. You may have missed that Xbox players will be getting a different crossover.</p><p>It looks like Xbox players can expect Snake to face off with Bomberman. Konami and Microsoft released a dedicated release date trailer for the Xbox version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> shortly after the State of Play. In lieu of the shot teasing the Ape Escape collaboration, the Xbox trailer instead plays the iconic "alert" Metal Gear sound effect over an exclamation point. The square serving as the point on that punctuation then unfolds to reveal a cartoonish bomb, which then blows up and shows a camouflage version of Bomberman with the text "Snake vs. ???" overlayed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti5bNYtsHy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ti5bNYtsHy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Konami isn't saying anything more about this special mode at this time, it's clear that this is a collaboration with another one of Konami's biggest franchises. Bomberman predates Metal Gear, as Hudson Soft created it in 1983. Konami has owned Bomberman since it acquired Hudson Soft in 2011 and developed new games in the series, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-bomberman-r/" data-ref-id="5000-461290">Super Bomberman R</a> and its sequel.</p><p>The top-down bomb-laying and maze-navigating gameplay of Bomberman is quite different from the hardcore action of Metal Gear, so we aren't sure how Konami will combine the two gameplay styles into a special mode just yet. The Ape Escape mode on PlayStation is expected to be similar to the Snake vs. Monkey mode that appeared in the original PS2 release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-18284">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 28. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/" data-ref-id="1100-6524133">now available for preorder</a>, with the $80 Digital Deluxe Edition granted 48 hours of early access to the game.</p>
