However, Capcom's franchise has hit some serious turbulence in the form of declining sales, which may be why the publisher is releasing Monster Hunter Wilds' expansion sooner than expected.</p><p>Capcom has moved up the release of Wilds' expansion from the end of September to August 13. This update will introduce a new level of difficulty, a new rewards system, adjustments to weapons balance, and more.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021<br>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p>  — Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Capcom has also shared its <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/1st/explanation_2025_1st_01.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly report for investors</a>, and the numbers aren't good for Monster Hunter Wilds. Between April 1 and June 30, Wilds sold only 477k copies, which was only slightly above its predecessor, Monster Hunter Rise, with 389k copies. Even Devil May Cry 5 outsold Monster Hunter Wilds in that period, with 1,782,000 copies. The high number for that game may be due to the Netflix anime adaptation.</p><p>According to Capcom's report, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold 10,585,000 copies since its release earlier this year. There have been signs that players weren't satisfied with Wilds, especially the PC port. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/" data-ref-id="1100-6532587">Monster Hunter World had more Steam players than Wilds</a> earlier this summer. Players also left a large number of negative reviews on Steam over Wilds' performance issues and lack of endgame content.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sees-huge-jump-in-pc-players-after-free-title-update-2/1100-6532910/" data-ref-id="1100-6532910">experienced an increase in players on Steam</a> after Capcom's most recent major update, but not all of the game's issues were addressed. It remains to be seen if the new expansion will turn things around for Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>

                <p>Persona 3 Reload is officially coming to Nintendo Switch 2 on October 23, 2025, as announced during Thursday's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase</a>. This version arrives well after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-3-reload-review-burn-your-dread/1900-6418171/" data-ref-id="1900-6418171">the game's initial release in February 2024</a> across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox One, Series X|S, and PC. Preorders will be available later today on the eShop.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload follows a high school student who transfers to Gekkoukan High and discovers a mysterious hidden hour known as the "Dark Hour," which occurs between one day and the next. During this time, the world transforms into a twisted, shadow-infested realm, and only a select few can remain conscious. The protagonist joins SEES (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad), a group of students who use powerful beings called Personas to battle Shadows and uncover the secrets behind the Dark Hour, Tartarus (a massive tower that appears only during this time), and a looming catastrophe tied to death itself.</p><p>A Switch port had been rumored for a while now, with Atlus initially <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/persona-3-reload-and-metaphor-refantazio-are-coming-to-switch-2-atlus-insider-claims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deciding against a Nintendo Switch version</a>. Developers previously admitted that "the idea is there" if the team opted to pursue it, but it was never truly planned for the original hardware, citing "performance concerns."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVcHF5_UtM0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hVcHF5_UtM0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Those same concerns aren't an issue for Switch 2. Persona 3 Reload was built using Unreal Engine 4, which presented some challenges when trying to port to the Switch. Switch 2, with updated hardware specifications such as 4K support, higher CPU/GPU performance, and increased memory bandwidth, seems to be better suited for the game's overall visuals.</p><p>Reload also contains additional scenes not featured in the original game or any of its re-releases, including new party interactions, dialogue, and fully voiced cutscenes. Every Social Link route is now completely voiced as well. Even exploration within Tartarus also features additional dialogue amongst the party, depending on who is taken into the dungeon at the time.</p><p>On its original release last year, Persona 3 Reload <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-3-reload-is-atluss-fastest-selling-game/1100-6520927/" data-ref-id="1100-6520927">became Atlus' fastest-selling game</a>, with a million copies in its first week.</p>
