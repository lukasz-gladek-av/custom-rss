                <p dir="ltr">NIS America has revealed that Ys X: Proud Nordics will arrive on Switch 2 and PC early next year in the US. The company calls this the definitive edition of the RPG, as it boasts a new storyline, mechanics, and dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">Ys X: Proud Nordics launched on Switch 2 last month in Japan. Originally, the RPG came out in 2023 in Japan before NIS America <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ys-x-nordics-making-its-way-to-the-west-later-this-year/1100-6521078/">brought Ys X: Nordics to the West in 2024</a> for PC, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. So far, there haven't been any details about a possible upgrade path for Ys X: Proud Nordics on Switch 2 or PC. There have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">paid Switch 2 upgrades</a> for Nintendo's new system as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/">free patches</a> for the hybrid system since it came out in June.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjgJnBtV-j4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TjgJnBtV-j4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Per usual, Ys X follows Adol Christin (the protagonist of every Ys game), though this time he's joined by a sailor named Karja. The game sees the duo dealing with the "looming threat of an undying horde known as the Griegr," per a press release. "Aboard their ship, the Sandras, Adol and Karja gather a trusty crew of friends and allies as they go head-to-head with the Griegr in one unforgettable journey!"</p><p dir="ltr">Intriguingly, Ys X actually takes place after Ys II and features naval combat for the first time in the franchise. No previous knowledge is needed with Ys X, however, since it's a standalone story. In addition to Switch 2, Ys X: Proud Nordics can be found on three different PC storefronts: Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to wait, the original Ys X: Nordics is on sale for $30 on PS5 and $35 on Switch.</p><p><strong>Ys X: Nordics Deluxe Edition</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">PS5</a> -- $30 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Ys+X%3A+Proud+Nordics+Coming+To+Switch+2+And+PC+In+2026&amp;fnauthor=evancampbell&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+11%3A33%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+11%3A54%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534185&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kqzyfj.com%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fys-x-nordics-deluxe-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fys-x-proud-nordics-coming-to-switch-2-and-pc-in-2026%2F1100-6534185%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Switch</a> -- $35 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul>

                <p>High on Life 2 continues the absurd tendencies of the original and will feature a playable version of Sega's Bible Adventures game.</p><p>Creative director Mikey Spano from developer Squanch Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/P45cJ2HdFh4?si=-VPiOXZCpOCcU6LD&amp;t=15141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed at Gamescom</a> that Richard Kind's character, Senator Muppy Doo, can factory reset your game, prompting a Bible Adventures takeover. The three games included with Bible Adventures--Noah's Ark, Baby Moses, and David and Goliath--are playable during this takeover. You can see how this unfolds in the video below.</p><p>Spano said someone at Squanch Games has "great connections" in the video game industry and helped get the rights sorted out to make this happen. When the idea came up to have this kind of in-game takeover with another game, Spano said it was his "dream" for Bible Adventures to be that game, but he didn't imagine it would work out. It did, and Spano said he's floored.</p><p>"A terrible video game based on the Bible is like the best thing I've ever heard in my life. It sucks so bad to play. It's great," he said.</p><p>In the original High on Life, the 1990 movie Demon Wind was watchable from start to finish, and Spano said the team at Squanch Games wanted to find a way to up the ante with the sequel.</p><p>High on Life 2 launches in February 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it'll also be available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a>. It's been a busy week for Game Pass announcements, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">many more games announced for the service as day-one releases.</a></p><p>One of the big changes in the sequel is that players can move around levels with a skateboard instead of a standard sprint option. This new component offers more than just a speedy way to move about, as players will be able to perform tricks and turn levels into skateparks, or use the board as a makeshift weapon in fights.</p><p>The idea for the original High on Life was conceived by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland, who later left the studio amid domestic violence allegations.</p>

                <p>What do you have when you take cozy cooking games with monster fighting? You have the cleverly titled Beastro, from Timberline Studios. This upcoming game combines cooking game mechanics, laidback farming, and strategic deckbuilding combat to deliver a fresh take on the adventure genre. In Beastro, the idea of saving the world begins with preparing the perfect meal.</p><p>Set to launch in 2026 on Steam and Xbox Series X|S (available day one with Xbox Game Pass), Beastro follows Panko, a young fox and chef who suddenly finds himself in charge of a village eatery after his mentor mysteriously disappears.</p><p>As Panko, players will manage the restaurant, grow ingredients on the farm, forage in the wild, and serve local patrons. But there's more to Panko’s new role--he also must feed the Caretakers, adventurers who are the last line of defense against looming threats beyond the village walls. You can check out the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ3NM3hZD1Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fZ3NM3hZD1Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each Caretaker comes from a different "flavor region" that influences their taste preferences and battle style. Some prefer sweet dishes, while others crave something bitter or spicy. By mastering a variety of cooking minigames and carefully crafting meals to match each adventurer's palate, players can boost their strength, unlock new cards for their deck, and prepare themselves for the battles ahead. The better the meal, the more effective the Caretakers become in combat against the monstrous threats.</p><p>After every expedition, the action continues in the form of a puppet show that reenacts the Caretakers' adventures. These turn-based battle sequences require tactical thinking and showcase the impact of the meals prepared earlier. From there, the Caretaker brings back the spoils of victory, which Panko can use for future meals.</p><p>Players can wishlist the game or register for updates on the <a href="https://www.beastro.game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official site</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In a brief developer preview, Bethesda showed off the upcoming C.A.M.P. Revamp update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-76/" data-ref-id="5000-482770">Fallout 76</a>. This update is geared towards making improvements to the game's CAMP-building mechanics as well as refining the workshop menu system.</p><p dir="ltr">As seen in the video below, Bethesda's creative director Jon Rush discussed the CAMP Revamp update, showing off the new streamlined menus to help make finding specific items faster. There are also new tools and new building rules.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlz9Bqp26BU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hlz9Bqp26BU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We're getting rid of our rules regarding placement, allowing you to toggle snapping, intersecting, and free-place anywhere," Rush said. "We see and hear you, sky campers."</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, players have been restricted from building certain modules and items on floating foundations, making it more difficult to build CAMP designs higher up as a form of sky bases. This should make building sky CAMPs easier, but hopefully it will also allow for better placement on the uneven terrain as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The CAMP Revamp update arrives to Fallout 76 on September 2, so players won't need to wait long to get their hands on the game's overhauled building system. Rush also teased that Fallout 76 will feature community CAMP-building contests later in the year, which will feature "huge" prizes.</p><p>The last major update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-fishing-guide-bait-recipes-and-how-to-catch-fish/1100-6532086/">Fallout 76 added fishing mechanics</a> and a new questline with Season 21: Gone Fission. </p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the teaser trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-trailer-suggests-itll-be-the-new-vegas-remaster-everyones-been-asking-for/1100-6534096/">Fallout Season 2</a> was revealed at Gamescom Opening Night Live. The trailer suggests the show will lean into the lore of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>
