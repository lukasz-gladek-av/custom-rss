                <p>Nintendo has secured a new patent that could have major implications for future Pokemon-inspired games. Granted on September 2, 2025, <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/api/pdf/downloadPdf/12403397?requestToken=eyJzdWIiOiI2ZjY5MzZiMi01M2Q1LTQ3NzUtYTgzNy02Y2NmMDkwNDM0OTAiLCJ2ZXIiOiJhMjM2NjRjYS1hNTNmLTRjOTItYjBjMy1lZWY1ZmYzMDVkOGEiLCJleHAiOjB9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the filing describes a system</a> that “covers the fundamental gameplay mechanic of summoning a character and letting it fight another” within a video game.</p><p>The patent application (<a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Games Fray</a>) was filed in March 2023 and was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office without any objection. It appears to be specifically focused on Pokemon-like games with its description and accompanying artwork, but there is concern that the wide-ranging text could potentially allow Nintendo to issue lawsuits against other companies and their games if they feature vaguely similar gameplay mechanics.</p><p>While Nintendo probably won't be taking companies like Atlus and Square Enix to court over established franchises with summoning mechanics like Persona, Shin Megami Tensei, and Final Fantasy, the existence of the patent could be discouraging to smaller studios, given the litigious nature of Nintendo.</p><p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has been in the crosshairs of Nintendo ever since its game was released in early access, as Nintendo sued the studio in Japan. In a statement, Nintendo explained that it was seeking "an injunction against infringement and compensation for damages" on the grounds that Palworld infringed on multiple patent rights--specifically patents <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>.</p><p>Pocketpair recently made big changes to Palworld, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-update-adds-big-change-to-avoid-disruptions-amid-nintendo-patent-lawsuit/1100-6531394/" data-ref-id="1100-6531394">removing Pal Spheres</a>--monster-catching items that were very similar to Pokeballs--and the ability to glide with a Pal. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-it-was-a-depressing-day-when-nintendo-sued/1100-6530182/">Speaking about the ongoing lawsuit</a> earlier this year, community manager John Buckley said it was a "very depressing day" for the studio when it got sued.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
