                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/">Baby Steps</a>, the hilariously awkward walking simulator from Devolver Digital, has taken a more cautious step back. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">In the looming shadow of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, the team announced a new release date for September 23. However, the developers released a fun new video of Nate, the game's perpetually off-balance, onesie-clad walker, attempting (and failing) to climb a massive statue of Hornet, the star of Silksong.</p><p>This isn't the first game to quietly adjust its footing in the wake of Silksong's long-awaited launch and an increasingly packed fall release schedule. Demonschool, another upcoming indie title from publisher Ysbryd Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/" data-ref-id="1100-6534245">has recently pushed its release to November, retreating from its original September 3 launch date.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Behind Baby Steps' slapstick charm is an all-star indie dev trio: Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch. Together, they've crafted a seemingly absurd yet oddly touching game about Nate, an unmotivated basement-dweller who discovers his one true gift: walking. One foot at a time, players guide Nate through a mysterious, scenic world using physics-driven controls that transform every hill into a mountain and every step into a monumental achievement.</p><p>With its new release date giving it some breathing room, Baby Steps now has a chance to shine on its own. Players will now help Nate lurch and flop through a surprisingly emotional journey filled with awkward encounters and scenic landscapes on September 23, on PC and PS5.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Scopely has revealed new details on the game's next season, Tales of Transformation. The season will start on September 2 and will run through December 2, with some of the highlights including a new transformation for a legendary Pokemon, more Mega Pokemon, and a few new pocket monsters will be coming to the game.</p><p>Kicking things off is confirmation that Keldeo will be able to transform into its Resolute Form during a season-long Special Research journey. In the Pokemon games, this form gives the mythical Pokemon more power and speed, and players who have already caught Keldeo can earn Keldeo Candy to power it up further.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxQyaeZu_d8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GxQyaeZu_d8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fans of Mega Pokemon can look forward to Mega Raid Days throughout the season, as Mega Sharpedo, Mega Camerupt, and Mega Metagross will all appear during this event. There'll also be new Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon appearing during Tales of Transformation, like Dynamax Abra, Dynamax Duraludon, and Gigantamax Garbodor. Anyone looking to capture some new critters can also hunt for Dripplin and Hydrapple next month.</p><p>Dripplin was introduced in the Teal Mask expansion for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and when certain conditions are met, it evolves into the Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon Hydrapple. It's the third branch of potential evolutions for Applin, the apple-inspired Pokemon that can also evolve into Flapple and Appletun.</p><p>Finally, players looking for a real challenge can take part in Shadow Raids to face off against Shadow Groudon and several other Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-is-completely-overhauling-its-leveling-system-in-october-to-be-more-rewarding/1100-6534230/">Pokemon Go will also overhaul progression</a>. Starting October 15, a new update will see the level cap raised, increased rewards, and much more added to the game.</p>

                <p>The latest Grounded 2 patch may not be adding anything completely new to the game, but it is removing some of the survival sandbox's biggest annoyances. Patch 0.1.3 includes some improvements for the Buggy, save-repair options, and makes sure resources will no longer respawn through your structures--though players still report frequent crashes.</p><p>In what Obsidian refers to as a "quick fix" pending more major changes, Grounded 2 is getting a handful of game-repair options to remove a few annoyances. You'll now be able to use the Creature Reset option to move all creatures back to their original locations, and the Buggy Reset to send all Buggies back to the nest, no matter where they were--or what state they were in.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grounded 2 Early Access is GREAT... But Also More of the Same So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>The game now ensures that all Snail Shells will automatically despawn after 24 hours, while a separate fix stops resources from spawning in the middle of player-built structures. Obsidian notes that you will still have to get rid of resources that are currently in your base once the update is applied, but that it shouldn't return after this.</p><p>A few bugs affecting the Buggy have been cleaned up, including a duplication glitch some players have been exploiting by using the Buggy's inventory.</p><p>Obsidian also estimates the new update comes with a 30% improvement to performance, resolving a few glitches that were known to cause game crashes. However, on the topic of stability, the studio reminds players that Grounded 2 is still in early access, and that players can expect stability and performance to continue to improve through development.</p><p>The Grounded sequel launched in early access at the end of July, and quickly racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-reaches-major-player-milestone/1100-6533899/" data-ref-id="1100-6533899">over 3 million players</a>.
