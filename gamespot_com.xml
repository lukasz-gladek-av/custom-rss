                <p>Fortnite's Simpsons season is apparently about to become a landmark for Epic Games' metaverse for reasons nobody could have expected--by reportedly offering the first shirtless character sporting visible nipples. The skin in question is <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991097774012797411" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an additional version of Homer Simpson</a>, separate from the one in the battle pass, who's wearing nothing but his tighty whities.</p><p>The discussion about Fortnite skins lacking nipples goes back to 2019, when a <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/terrycarter/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-nipples" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">gigantic, shirtless and nipple-less digital version of Travis Scott</a> performed a concert in Battle Royale. Since then we've gotten plenty of other shirtless guys as skins--but none have had nipples. It's not really that hard to figure out why that's been the norm, though, since Fortnite's art style is not realistic or detailed enough for nipples to be anything other than weird. But with Homer, who's cel-shaded and not very detailed, they can draw a couple circles on his chest that don't look upsetting the way that more detailed nipples on, say, the Mr. Savage skin probably would.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607240"></a><figcaption>This mostly-naked version of Homer Simpsons is reportedly going to be an item shop skin.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4607240-underwearhomer.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Homer in his underwear is a topic because this week's update added some loading screens, like the one above, that indicate pretty clearly we'll be facing off against a Giant Homer before the season ends--likely controlled by a player, similar to the Megazord and Godzilla events earlier this year. That this Giant Homer will also be a skin sold in the item shop is just a rumor for the moment, and it's possible that the model that has been datamined is merely the giant one that will roam the Battle Royale island.</p><p>But the leaker who broke this one, Dr Cacahuette, <a href="https://x.com/DrCacahuette/status/1991079736726970702" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claims</a> it has associated accessories, a Lego style, and support for kicks, all of which point to it being a player skin. It's possible it will be free, like the cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin was before the end of Remix season a year ago, but since Epic is already giving away the Cuddle Team Rider skin in a separate event, Underwear Homer is likely to be in the item shop.</p>

                <p>David Anthony Burke, who began his music career as D4vd after uploading <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> montages to YouTube with his own original songs in 2021, has reportedly been identified as a suspect in the murder of Celeste Rivas.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/11/18/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas-death/#continued" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, law enforcement said that despite there being no official paperwork classifying Burke as a suspect yet, "investigators are looking at [him] as a suspect." Those same investigators reportedly claimed they're viewing Rivas' death as a homicide while waiting on toxicology results from the medical examiner's office.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/d4vd-suspect-celeste-rivas/3806178/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NBC Los Angeles report</a> corroborates TMZ, stating that an LAPD officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said Burke has been uncooperative with the investigation and that he likely had help with dismembering and disposing of Rivas' body this past spring. According to law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/decomposed-body-found-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-los-angeles-rcna230159" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who spoke to NBC News</a>, Rivas' remains were not intact when discovered.</p><p>Sources told <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/singer-d4vd-considered-suspect-investigation-teen-found-dead/story?id=126591951" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ABC News</a> that, although the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made, investigators have contacted multiple people they believe were involved with the case in some way. This includes Burke.</p><p>Celeste Rivas disappeared in the Lake Elsinore area last year. She was reportedly last seen on April 5, 2024, in the western Riverside County community in Southern California. Family members said she knew Burke, and her brother, Matthew, <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/body-of-teen-girl-found-in-singer-d4vds-impounded-tesla-what-we-know/3826873/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told NBCLA</a> that she was on her way to see a movie with him the day she disappeared.</p><p>Rivas' body was found in the front trunk of a Tesla parked in an LA tow yard on September 8. Workers noticed a foul odor coming from the vehicle, which was registered to Burke, and notified nearby authorities. Officers came through and discovered the remains in a bag, later to be identified via forensics as the missing teenager.</p><p>Burke was a rising star in the alternative R&amp;B scene, but he started as a gamer. He uploaded various Fortnite montages and anime compilations to YouTube under a channel called "ant" in 2021, but his videos kept getting copyright strikes because of his music choices. To combat this, he started creating his own songs to pair with his videos, which eventually led to his D4vd persona, which he claimed in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbF7opVBnHQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Zach Sang Show interview</a> was both for SEO and the four cinematic universes (and the characters) he was building.</p><p>He quickly found popularity on TikTok and eventually signed a record deal with Interscope Records' Darkroom label. He'd then produce a single for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-calls-out-netflix-for-disrespectful-ai-made-arcane-season-2-poster/1100-6527972/" data-ref-id="1100-6527972">Arcane Season 2</a>, record the official Fortnite anthem "Locked &amp; Loaded," perform at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards in December 2024</a>, and go on a world tour in August 2025. The remaining tour dates have been canceled following Rivas' death.</p><p>According to ABC News, investigators believe that the medical examiner's office will determine the official cause of death soon. Sources said this will be a vital step in making an arrest and finalizing the charges.</p>

                <p>Epic Games is <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/news/unity-and-epic-games-together-advance-the-open-interoperable-future-for-video-gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teaming up with Unity </a>to support the popular game engine within Fortnite. Eventually, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said, this partnership will allow "all Unity games" to be published within Fortnite. That means even games that weren't designed for Fortnite should work, and this move could pave the way for Epic to fully incorporate Fall Guys into Fortnite.</p><p>"Starting next year, Unity developers will be able to publish games directly into Fortnite to appear in Fortnite’s discovery system alongside games built with Unreal Engine and to participate in the Fortnite economy as it evolves towards an open metaverse economy connecting all users and all engines," <a href="https://x.com/unrealengine/status/1991074004963057977" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sweeney said</a> Wednesday at Unity's Unite conference.</p><p>This is major news for developers, who will be able to make things for Fortnite without using Epic's tools and may be able to import their existing games into Fortnite as well. And with the recent news that Epic will allow <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">Creative maps to sell things for V-Bucks</a>, these Unity devs might actually be able to sell their games in Fortnite.</p><p>It's been a common theory among Fortnite players that Epic will eventually incorporate as many of its other games into Fortnite as it can--and this Unity news will surely fuel rumors about Fall Guys becoming a proper Fortnite mode. While most Epic titles run on Unreal Engine, as you'd expect since that's Epic's own engine, Fall Guys is a rare exception that runs on Unity. Epic has allowed folks who use the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to make their own Fall Guys islands in Fortnite since August 2024, and so it wouldn't be all that surprising if Epic ended up adding the proper full Fall Guys game into Fortnite as part of this partnership with Unity.</p><p>This deal is still fresh, though, and it'll be a bit before we learn many specific details--Epic promises to deliver more info next year.</p>
