                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> servers are down, but don't worry. It's all part of the plan. Fortnite servers will be back up soon; here's what you need to know.</p><p>With Fortnite's latest all-Marvel season coming to an end, it's time to look ahead to what's next, and it's poised to be another nostalgic trip down memory lane for longtime fans. Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 is imminent. Like Fortnite OG last November, this is poised to be a return (and remix, of course) of the original Chapter 2 island, complete with skins, weapons, loot, and more all fitting of that era of Epic's massive game.</p><h2>Fortnite servers down - When does Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 start?</h2><p>When Fortnite's servers come back up, it'll usher in this year's massive Remix season, though Epic has already revealed it will unfold for just one month before another Chapter finale event ushers in another new island in December.</p><p>The Chapter 2 map coming back will be, for some players, a bigger deal than the OG map last year, but all we can do now is wait until Epic brings Fortnite back online. But when will that be? Unfortunately, it's not a question with an easy answer, because there's no scheduled time for this maintenance window to end. Typically, you can expect to see a new Fortnite season to kick off between 7 AM and 10 AM ET on launch day--in this case, November 2--though there have been major exceptions.</p><p>Earlier this year, for example, there was some sort of technical issue that kept the game offline until late in the evening, with Fortnite staying offline for nearly a day. But that was a very unusual situation and shouldn't be expected to be repeated often.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393751"></a><figcaption>A new blast from the past is coming very soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4393751-4379284-fortnitechapter2season2.jpg"></figure><p>Once the game does return, Remix Chapter 2 will introduce a whole host of changes such as a new (well, <em>returning</em>) map inspired by Chapter 2, vehicles fitting of that era--or perhaps no vehicles at all at first, since cars weren't added until Chapter 2 Season 3--as well as a new Remix Chapter 2 Pass that is likely to celebrate some of that era's favorite characters with mash-ups, such as Meowscles and Midas being combined into one character.</p><p>Once the servers do come back up, we'll give you a massive roundup of everything new in Fortnite Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 right here.</p>

                <p>This week, Dragon Age fans have been able to dive back into the continent of Thedas in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-gone-gold/1100-6526915/" data-ref-id="1100-6526915">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Longtime players may recognize that events in the game were foreshadowed in some of the previous installments. According to former Dragon Age lead writer David Gaider, that's because he laid out of the series' lore years ago in a document that's still influencing the direction of the games.</p><p>"The way I created the world was to seed plots in various parts of the world that could be part of... a single game," Gaider told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "Then there was the overall uber-plot, which I didn't know for certain that we would ever get to, but I had an understanding of how it all worked together... A lot of that was in my head until we were starting Inquisition and the writers got a little bit impatient with my memory or lack thereof, so they pinned me down and dragged the uber-plot out of me. I'd talked about it, I'd hinted at it, but never really spelled out how it all connected, so they dragged it out of me. We put it into a master lore doc, the secret lore, which we had to hide from most of the team."</p><p>Although Gaider left BioWare after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, there are signs in The Veilguard that his original plan is still being followed, at least to a degree. He pointed to the return of Fen'Harel as a major example. However, Gaider declined to state what his original ending for the Dragon Age lore was just in case BioWare ever gets around to telling that story.</p><p>"I always had this dream of where it would all end, the very last plot," added Gaider. " But the idea that this uber-plot was this sort of biggest, finite... That the final thing you could do in this world that would break it was there as a 'Maybe we would get to do that one day.'"</p><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

It's only fitting for the man who is not only headlining Fortnite Festival Season 6, but who will also feature prominently in this new music-heavy retro season of battle royale.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zJK2qBcSYs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9zJK2qBcSYs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As has long been rumored, Fortnite Chapter 5 is wrapping up with a sequel to last year's OG season. Chapter 2 Remix will, as the name implies, focus on Chapter 2--specifically the first few seasons. The season will run for just a month, ending on the evening of November 30, and will bring with it the Remix Pass. The Remix Pass is shorter than a normal battle pass at just 70 tiers, and it includes five skins that are remixes of existing skins from early Chapter 2. That's one more skin than last year's OG Pass included.</p><p>Each week of the Remix season will focus on a different artist. Week 1 is Snoop, Week 2 is Eminem--complete with a new skin inspired by his Houdini music video get-up, Week 3 is Ice Spice, and the fourth and final week will feature a tribute to the late Juice WRLD. Each week will come with themed locations and weapons in battle royale, and new item shop skins for each of the artists. And to top it all off, a cel-shaded Juice WRLD skin will be given out for free to anyone who logs in on the final day of the season, November 30, when the Remix finale event will go down.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4393788"></a><figcaption>Snoop Dogg is headlining both Fortnite Remix Chapter 2 and Festival Season 6.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4393788-fortniteremixchapter2snoopdogg.jpg"></figure><p>Over in Fortnite Festival, Snoop Dogg is headlining a new Music Pass with a throwback cel-shaded skin, and he also has a bundle of item shop cosmetics as well. At 1,400 V-Bucks, this pass is cheaper than the previous Festival passes, but it still includes four jam tracks in addition to some Festival instruments. The tracks are:</p><ul><li>"Robbery" by Juice WRLD</li><li>"Bounce Back" by Big Sean</li><li>"Crank That" by Soulja Boy Tell Em</li><li>"Young, Wild and Free" by Snoop Dogg, Wiz Khalifa and Bruno Mars</li></ul><p>The new season of Fortnite Festival will run until January 14.</p>

Along with big discounts on four prebuilt gaming PCs, most PCs in the sale are eligible for free two-year warranties, free shipping, and a Nvidia game bundle that gets you a free copy of Star Wars Outlaws.</p><p>Most of the gaming rigs on sale are ultra-premium models equipped with the latest hardware on the market.

It also comes with a free Lian-Li Uni Fan upgrade--a bonus that can’t be found on the other three models on sale.</p><p>These discounts will stick around until December 8, though Maingear notes that <strong>inventory is limited</strong>--so if one of the items is popular, it could disappear before the anticipated end date.

                <p>Arcade1Up has released plenty of Pac-Man arcade cabinets over the years, but the newest full-size addition to its catalog might be the coolest yet. Launched on October 8, the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine/dp/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up Limited-Edition Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet</a></strong> is now available for purchase at Amazon. Due to Arcade1Up labeling this particular Pac-Man cabinet a "limited edition," it would appear that once Amazon sells out, Pac-Man Plus will be gone for good.</p><p>If you don't have room for the Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet or want a more affordable way to play Pac-Man, Arcade1Up just released a new <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga Countercade</a></strong>. Though both of the new machines are listed as available now, Amazon currently estimates orders won't arrive until November 19.</p><div title="6527528 - Arcade1Up Pac-Man Limited Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2793" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6527528 - Arcade1Up Pac-Man Limited Edition" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine/dp/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine\/dp\/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine/dp/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Arcade1Up Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine/dp/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine\/dp\/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Plus-Deluxe-Arcade-Machine/dp/B0DG476XYC?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$500</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This cabinet features a striking wood panel-inspired design, giving it an extremely retro flair. It's a more minimalistic style than the usual Arcade1Up cabinet, but it does have a wrap-around scene with ghosts chasing the ever-hungry Pac-Man and an RGB light strip beneath the cabinet that produces an under-glow effect.</p><p>Adding to its authentic look is the faux molded coin door and light-up marque dubbing Pac-Man Plus an "Exciting New" iteration of the classic game. It also has a faux-molded coin door.</p><p>The control panel has a real-feel joystick, six buttons, and switches for power and volume. Like other Arcade1Up Deluxe cabinets, Pac-Man Plus has a 17-inch screen, dual speaker system, and stands in at 61 inches (just over five feet) without needing a separate riser.</p><p>Here’s a look at the games available on the Pac-Man Plus Deluxe Cabinet:</p><ul><li>Pac-Man</li><li>Dig Dug</li><li>Dig Dug 2</li><li>Pac-Mania</li><li>Pac &amp; Pal</li><li>Super Pac-Man</li><li>Pac-Man Plus</li><li>Pac-Land</li><li>Galaga</li><li>Galaxian</li><li>Galaga ‘88</li><li>Mappy</li><li>Rompers</li><li>Rolling Thunder</li></ul><p>You can even sync your scores online to a global leaderboard to see how you stack up to other players.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received an update today, November 1, introducing a number of changes and fixes across multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p>For multiplayer, the update fixes an issue that caused some players to see a black screen when loading into a multiplayer or Zombies match. Beyond that, Black Ops 6's multiplayer mode has removed the Lowtown map from the Infected playlist and fixed an issue in free-for-all matches that caused scoring to be based on total score, rather than elimination points, as it's meant to be.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1187489287" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

when defusing or planting the bomb. It's expected that players will continue to try to find new ways to use Omni-movement to their advantage.</p><p>In the meantime, players have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xp-farming-trick-turns-you-into-a-terrible-teammate/1100-6527534/" data-ref-id="1100-6527534">discovered flashbanging teammates earns you XP.</a></p><p>For Zombies, the November 1 patch addresses an exploit that allowed players to activate timed GobbleGums more than once. The patch also resolves an issue that allowed players to utilize Tactical Raft to block zombies. What's more, the game had an issue where players could get stuck in Spectator mode, but that's now been fixed.</p><p>You can see all the changes for Black Ops 6 multiplayer and Zombies below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/10/bo6-preseason-patch-notes#nov1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Activision.</a> For more, you can check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6 campaign</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review/1900-6418309/" data-ref-id="1900-6418309">multiplayer</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-review/1900-6418310/" data-ref-id="1900-6418310">Zombies reviews.</a> You can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-black-ops-6-the-replacer-video-is-maybe-the-best-and-funniest-yet/1100-6527545/" data-ref-id="1100-6527545">watch The Replacer have some fun on Jeopardy</a> in a silly promo video for Black Ops 6.</p><h2>Friday, November 1, 2024</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some players may encounter a black screen when loading into a public or private match for both Multiplayer and Zombies.</li></ul><h4>Settings</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue when trying to select DLSS or DLAA in the upscaling options.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with the unlock notification for Diamond Mastery Badges.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Maps</h4><ul><li>Removed Lowtown from Infected map pool.</li></ul><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li>Added Infected to Private Match mode select.</li><li>Resolved an issue in Free-For-All where scoring was based on total score rather than the number of elimination points.</li><li>Resolved an issue in Search and Destroy where players could slide too far while defusing or planting the bomb.</li></ul><h4>Weapons</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with the Slug attachment on Shotguns dealing incorrect damage.</li></ul><h4>Progression</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue where challenges requiring Dive Kills were not awarded properly.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the UAV.</li><li>Resolved an issue with stability in Infected when earning medals.</li><li>Resolved an issue with stability when using the Vigilance perk.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to re-activate timed GobbleGums.</li></ul><h4>Enemies</h4><ul><li>Specials and Elites killed by scorestreaks will no longer drop items.</li></ul><h4>Terminus</h4><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with the Tactical Raft.</li></ul><h4>Liberty Falls</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue that prevented Scorestreaks from being used after completing the Main Quest.</li><li>Resolved an issue that would leave the player in spectator mode when dying after completing the Main Quest.</li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Resolved an issue with stability when changing field upgrades.</li><li>Added various server-side stability fixes.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Adjusted round UI limit to 999 from 256.</li></ul>
