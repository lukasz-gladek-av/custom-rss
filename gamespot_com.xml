                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 comes loaded with plenty of levels, including every stage from the original versions of both games as well as a few brand-new stages, like Movie Studio and Pinball. However, developer Iron Galaxy actually created several more levels--11, by our count--that you can find via the Create-A-Park mode.</p><p>Select Create-A-Park and you'll see a whole bunch of user-created courses. Thus far, they are ... well, they aren't good, to put it mildly. Most are simply advertising an easy way to earn a few of the game's hardest achievements, and offer little else. However, scroll down and you'll see a "Developer" section, where all the levels were designed by Iron Galaxy itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Now, to be clear, these stages lack the complexity--both visual and mechanical--of the "real" stages in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, but their simplicity and emphasis on performing nearly impossible tricks helps to make them a good contrast after you've had your fill of the others. Iron Galaxy even put in collectables and other goals to make things more interesting, albeit ones that are fairly easy considering the small size of these stages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352"></a><figcaption>Skateboarding is totally legal in whatever dimension this is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg"></figure><p>However, be careful not to select one stage in particular: Torment Nexus. As the name implies, this is not a good time, as you're dropped into a pit full of angry construction workers who will beat you up as you are thrown around on a boost tile like the worst version of Mario Kart.

                <p>A long-requested feature is finally sailing to Sea of Thieves, but players will have to shell out some cash to take advantage of it. Custom servers, along with other unannounced "benefits," are included in a subscription service coming to Rare's live-service pirate game in early 2026. Developers from Rare made the announcement during a Community Direct video on Wednesday.</p><p>Sea of Thieves is dependent on emergent encounters with both computer-controlled enemies and real players, both of whom can engage in hostilities with players. With custom servers, players can create their own "private customisable sandbox" with adjustable options for loot and enemy spawns. Private servers can also run "Safer Seas Fleets," allowing players to invite their friends, free of beligerent randos. Rare has not stated how much this subscription model will cost.</p><p>Rare was one of the many studios hit by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">massive layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which also resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">cancellation of the studio's project Everwild</a>. Gregg Mayles, a veteran of the company who served as the creative director for both Sea of Thieves and Everwild, reportedly departed Rare following the latter's cancellation.</p><p>The nearly hour-long Community Direct did not address the layoffs, the fate of Everwild, or Mayles' exit from the company. Instead, the video featured five members of the Sea of Thieves team addressing the health of their online game and detailing additions coming in the next several months.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKQiiI3ElkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rare also touched on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-season-17-introduces-smugglers-faction-and-new-weapons/1100-6532263/" data-ref-id="1100-6532263">already-announced Season 17</a>, which introduces a new faction called The Smugglers' League and additional loot to the game's sandbox. Seasons overall will have a more monthly structure, introducing new content and events every month rather than throwing everything new at the players upon the season's debut.</p><p>With Season 17 specifically, the first month will properly introduce The Smugglers' League, the second month brings a "heist" live event, and the third month will refresh the map's Skeleton Forts. The developers also briefly teased Season 18, which centers on the perilous Devil's Roar area of the game's world.</p><p>And in a move that might excite devoted players, Rare is lifting the NDA from the game's Insider Programme, which provides preview builds showcasing upcoming updates to Sea of Thieves. The developers describe the move as a "first step" in opening larger conversations with the game's community.</p><p>It's been rough waters for Rare, but the studio appears keen to reassure Sea of Thieves players that the game still has wind in its sails, hopefully for years to come.</p>

                <p>IO has acknowledged the performance issues on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination/">Hitman: World of Assassination - Signature Edition</a> that have mired its release as a Nintendo Switch 2 launch title.</p><p dir="ltr">As one of a few third-party releases that was supposed to showcase the new console's ability to run graphically intensive current-gen titles, the port has been criticized for its many technical issues. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition-disappoints-on-switch-2/1100-6532229/">impressions</a>, we noted that its uncapped frame rate resulted in "uneven" performance that "fluctuates wildly," surprisingly mitigated in handheld mode due to the display supporting built-in Variable Refresh Rate (VRR).</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfKQgglhaBU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FfKQgglhaBU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a> interview, IO's franchise director Jonathan Lacaille has addressed these issues, saying, “The team is working on some of those performance issues right now, and they are addressing it over the summer." A specific date for when exactly these fixes will go live is not yet known.</p><p dir="ltr">Lacaille also took the opportunity to assuage doubts over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/007-first-light/">007 First Light</a>, which is also being developed for Switch 2 alongside the other, more powerful platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">“It’s, of course, good learning for us to bring to First Light as well--so all of this will be learnings we bring to the next title.”</p><p dir="ltr">The Hitman series has previously come to Switch 1 with a cloud version of Hitman 3, as well as a port of older title Hitman: Blood Money, but Lacaille assures that "the Switch 2 is a powerful device--powerful enough for us to bring First Light to it natively.”</p><p>The Switch 2 version of Hitman: World of Assassination isn't the only recent IO release plagued with technical issues. The company also published MindsEye from developer Build A Rocket Boy, and it's one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, with performance issues so bad that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-players-say-theyre-getting-mindseye-refunds/1100-6532383/">PS5 players were getting refunds</a> from the PlayStation Store.</p>
