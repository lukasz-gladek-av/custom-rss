                <p dir="ltr">A new hide-and-seek online multiplayer mode called Fox Hunt for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will have a pretty big drawback: no cross-play support. That means players can't face off unless they're on the same platform. The remake of the PlayStation 2 classic is slated for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p dir="ltr">Konami confirmed the lack of cross-play for Metal Gear Solid Delta <a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>, with GameSpot verifying the translation. While the game launches later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-will-add-a-hide-and-seek-based-multiplayer-mode-this-fall/1100-6533794/">Fox Hunt isn't set to arrive until this fall</a>. The multiplayer mode will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-brings-back-online-multiplayer/1100-6532384/">share elements with 2008's Metal Gear Online</a> but is completely original.</p><p dir="ltr">Fox Hunt won't be the only additional activity alongside the main campaign. Metal Gear Solid Delta will also feature Snake Vs. Monkey on PC and PS5 (which was part of the original Metal Gear Solid 3) and Snake Vs. Bomberman on Xbox Series X|S (which is a new mode). The game is set to come out August 28, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorder-restock-guide/1100-6524133/">the collector's edition recently restocked</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Metal Gear Solid creator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/">Hideo Kojima was asked whether he would check out the Metal Gear Solid 3 remake</a>. The question apparently made Kojima laugh, before he replied with: "No, I won't." <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-has-left-konami-and-kojima-production/1100-6431536/">Kojima left Konami</a> in a highly discussed split in 2015 after working there for almost three decades.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Official Bring the Boom Trailer (With Halo ODST Teaser) | Out August 26</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, the signal seems familiar but doesn't quite sound like anything from Halo. However, when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1moadmj/clip_comparing_a_segment_of_the_reversed_signal/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-grunts-think-theyve-found-more-evidence-of-a-halo-crossover-thanks-to-a-very-familiar-unknown-signal-detected-by-the-galactic-warning-system-is-that-the-superintendent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signal's audio</a> is reversed, it sounds almost identical to the phone alarm for the AI Superintendent from Halo 3: ODST. It's that alarm which helps guide ODST's Rookie through the embattled streets of New Mombasa following a Covenant invasion. Is the Superintendent now trying to warn Helldivers of a coming threat?</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Arrowhead Studios hasn't said anything official about a Halo crossover just yet, but Halo's ODSTs and Super Earth's Helldivers are so similar that it would be a crime against Managed Democracy if a collaboration didn't happen. What all the crossover will entail is still anybody's guess, but there will almost certainly be ODST cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as was the case when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-first-crossover-is-officially-killzone-2-and-the-dlc-is-out-now/1100-6528541/" data-ref-id="1100-6528541">Helldivers 2 crossed over with Sony's Killzone</a> franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani gave credit to publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">Sony for deciding to release Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a>, stating to a fan on Discord that the choice was "all PlayStation" but that Arrowhead was "all in support of course." Helldivers 2's most recent Control Group Warbond introduced some new experimental tech for players to test out, including a mini-teleportation device and a gun with seven-barrels that can be more than a little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/be-careful-firing-helldivers-2s-new-weapon-if-you-have-a-lot-of-ammo/2900-6760/" data-ref-id="2900-6760">dangerous if you have a lot of ammo</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tekken is a mainstay of the Evo tournament series--and of the entire fighting game genre. But things haven't been entirely rosy at the King of Iron Fist tournament lately. Despite very strong sales for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a>, many competitive players have expressed a dislike for the changes to characters and overall gameplay introduced in Season 2, and they've been very vocal about it on social media. Knowing that things are a bit stormy around Tekken 8's competitive scene lately, I went into an interview with members of the Tekken team at Evo to ask questions about their upcoming content plans, how to deal with criticism, revisiting past games, and the impending return of their number one 3D fighting game rival.</p><p dir="ltr">As the session began, I was shown the trailer for Armor King by director Kohei Ikeda, often referred to by players and staff as Nakatsu. Armor King is a classic returning character, with appearances going back to the very first Tekken. He leans heavily into the "heel" wrestling persona, with a black, spikey outfit and an offense-oriented skillset with a new stance called Bad Jaguar. He can even make the stage floor crumble when performing his rage art.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tekken 8 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I noticed that when Armor King's attacks hit the opponent, there's a brief flash of the Japanese kanji "aku" (悪), meaning evil. "You're the first person to notice that," Tekken designer and interpreter Michael Murray said. "It's there because Armor King's classic costume used to feature that kanji prominently."</p><p dir="ltr">These kinds of character details have become increasingly important in Tekken 8. "In the past, we [included] lots of character details, such as Kazuya being a sneaker collector," Murray said. "But over time, we kind of stopped doing it. Then the fans were like, 'Why? We used to love those kinds of details.' So we tried to bring that back for Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">I then got to see the debut of the all-new character, Miary Zo. Miary hails from the African island of Madagascar and fights using traditional African martial arts. Tekken Project producer and series veteran Katsuhiro Harada wanted to emphasize that they did their homework when they decided to design the series' first African character. "Makatsu [Ikeda] and I actually went to Madagascar for research. We were able to connect with not just the local fighting game community, but also different groups of people. One thing we learned is that Madagascar's place in the African region is quite unique in how it came about, with its people and its culture located off the coast of the African continent.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So what we found out was that their roots come from Southeast Asia as well as the main continent. The people of Madagascar have a different look to them than those of the African mainland, like with skin color and hairstyles. For example, we noticed a lot more people in Madagascar had straight hair, especially women."</p><p dir="ltr">The pursuit of authenticity had some unexpected challenges. "When we were trying to do the voiceovers, we learned that there's no established industry in Madagascar for voice recording, it's mainly a few people who sometimes do dubs for TV shows in the local language. So to find a voice actor for Miary Zo, we actually had to look for young folks who wanted to be voice actors. We did several rounds of auditions to find the person who was adequate for this task. But then also once we found them, recording at the studio itself was tough, because there's many power outages throughout the day. So actually finishing the recording was quite a challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">After this new character introduction, I felt that it was time to address the elephant in the room: How was the team responding to criticism of Tekken 8's Season 2? "We had a lot of new people on the team," Harada explained. "I'm actually fairly conservative when it comes to game design. I usually wouldn't make huge changes, but with Tekken 8, I do feel like our team successfully created something unique and new. When the game launched, players loved it. It had a 90 Metacritic and won Best Fighting Game at The Game Awards. But this was before Season 1 ended.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That being said, we realized that a portion of the Tekken fanbase is also very conservative. Many people would perhaps want to see something closer to Tekken 7, for example. But then that's very hard to tell from the outside, because you have all these strong opinions on the internet. Then you have other people who just joined from Tekken 8, who don't know anything about Tekken and are enjoying themselves. Even though there may be a conflict between those opinions, we don't want to make them fight against each other about what's proper Tekken."</p><p dir="ltr">"We had this brand-new game in Tekken 8, and we were trying to make it feel even more different and new in Season 2," Harada continued. "So some people liked it, and some people didn't. We're trying to continue to monitor the community and to have a discussion with them to find a middle ground that everyone can enjoy--whether you were a series fan, a fan of Tekken 7 in particular, or whether you like the new systems in Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, with social media being what it is, it's easy to get overwhelmed with negativity and hate-baiting clout farming. How does the team separate signal from noise? "It's difficult," Harada admitted. "Social media is actually a good way to collect information for Tekken development. It's also important to come to events like Evo or Comic-Con, though. I can hear the opinions of people who compete in tournaments--sometimes I hear opinions different from what the pro players are saying. At an event like Comic-Con, I can talk to fans who are less engaged in the competitive side of things."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1579032315" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

I keep an open mind and remember it's not a personal attack. It feels like it is sometimes. But I take the data and try to get to what they're saying, then lay it on the table with Nakatsu. We look it over and say, 'Okay, what represents most of our gaming population? What would make the most people happy?' rather than worrying about what people are trying to do on social media."</p><p dir="ltr">"I do listen to negative opinions, but I only think of it as one person's opinion," Harada continued. But online media can have the effect of making that negativity seem bigger than it is. When you're listening to all these different people, are they saying what they're really believing, or are they just echoing the sentiment of some other person that they heard? Also, some people who are unhappy with something voice that opinion, but others just leave without saying anything. On the other hand, there are people that are happy with the current state of Tekken 8, and they keep playing the game, but we don't hear from them either, because they're not vocal about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Murray chimed in with his own anecdote: "Harada often told us a story about developing around the Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament era. The team wanted to make a new game, so they took all the stuff that people didn't like about Tekken at the time. The thinking was, 'If we get rid of those parts, then obviously everyone's going to love the new game.' But that didn't work out. They came up with Tekken 4, which at the time was thought of as a strange version of Tekken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We use that as a lesson--that just taking things and limiting elements that people are complaining about doesn't necessarily make a good game. So that's why we're trying to be very careful in our evaluation of what people say about Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite online complaints, Tekken 8 continues to have a strong playerbase, though some players have decided they'd rather play older titles like Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection or Tekken Tag Tournament 2 instead. This isn't uncommon in the fighting game scene--if some players don't care for a new game, they'll often continue to play an older game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Harada if he'd consider putting together a compilation of older Tekken titles for these players. "It's a bit difficult," he replied. "It's a concept that's worked well for Capcom. Maybe popular sentiment has changed over time, but back when the subject of reissuing past Tekken titles came up, we did research about the concept's market viability. But 3D fighters--for example, Virtua Fighter and Tekken--have typically been showcases of the latest technology in gaming at that time. That's less the case with 2D fighting games. When we were looking at people in the 2D fighter audience, they would go back and play the older titles, whether that's Street Fighter II or Street Fighter III Third Strike, whatever. Maybe they wouldn't move to the latest game, or maybe they'd play both at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But with 3D fighters, the majority of people would always go to the latest installment, because it had the prettiest graphics and the best technology at the time. Not many people went back and played the older titles. And we noticed, in the console version of Tekken 5, we included the older iterations of the arcade versions for Tekken 1, 2, and 3. People would boot the games up and go, 'Oh yeah, I remember this!' And then they return to the main game. But maybe things have changed, and we need to revisit our thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">"Personally, as a business decision for the company, it makes sense to have someone port the games and repackage them," Harada continued. "But as a developer, it's not very entertaining to go back and recreate something I've already worked on. And there are other factors. For Tekken Tag 2 as an example, it's a game some of the hardcore Tekken fans really love. Makatsu and I both love it too. But when you look at the overall sales, it did even worse than Tekken 4. It almost killed the series. Sometimes, peoples' memory of something is much different than reality."</p><p dir="ltr">With a new Virtua Fighter game on the horizon, Tekken's most-prominent competition in the 3D fighting game arena has returned to the ring. Despite what many people think, however, the Tekken and Virtua Fighter teams are quite amicable towards one another, with Harada having frequently pushed publicly for a new Virtua Fighter game. With that in mind, I asked about his feelings seeing Virtua Fighter return after such a long time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"From an emotional viewpoint and also a business or company employee viewpoint, we've always had a friendly rivalry," said Harada. "For a while, it felt like the series stopped. People were resigned to not knowing when or if a new Virtua Fighter would release. For quite some time, even when Tekken became thought of as the longest, continuing 3D fighting game series, no one said, 'Hey, wait, there's Virtua Fighter.' Everyone seemed to feel that VF was done.</p><p dir="ltr">"I found it frustrating, because that left us as practically the only big name in 3D fighting. To have our rival just disappear and not be a vital part of the genre was maddening. I want them to come back, and quickly, because it's lonely here. We want other games like VF to be around, because they attract attention and bring people into 3D fighters."</p><p dir="ltr">To close out the interview, I asked Harada about his feelings on the current fighting game landscape. "There's a lot of people coming into the space in addition to these new, major fighting game titles. People talk about the '90s fighting game boom, but it ended kind of abruptly. But now everyone is back in full force. Sales of major franchises--Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat--all have done very well, not just for fighting games, but for video games in general. If you look at the competitors and viewers for Evo year over year, or even for our own Tekken World Tour, I think the fighting game boom is happening as we speak."</p>

To continue on with 2K26's ratings week, the developers have revealed the best rookies in the game at launch. While the first few members of the top 10 rookies are as expected, there are some shifts at the bottom of the list compared to how draft night went earlier in 2025.</p><p>Below, you can see the top 10 rookies in NBA 2K26 according to their ratings at launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh57YWNaQC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mh57YWNaQC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>NBA 2K26 rookie ratings</h2><p>We'll count down each of the top rookies by their rating below. There's certainly one outlier on the list, and you can probably guess who that is, but there are some other rookies you'll definitely want to keep your eye on as the NBA season begins.</p><h3>Cooper Flagg - 82 OVR</h3><p>Let's get first-round draft pick Cooper Flagg out of the way. The new Dallas Mavericks forward is given a rare 80+ rating for a rookie, which doesn't often happen unless 2K believes the player is a generational prospect. The jury is still out on Flagg as we haven't seen him in any real action yet, but he has the tools to be an immediate star.</p><h3>Dylan Harper - 78 OVR</h3><p>We're back to reality now, and second overall draft pick Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs comes in at the number two spot on the list. If Cooper Flagg wasn't in the draft, Harper is the first overall choice by a landslide, and the Spurs are certainly building something special between him and Victor Wembanyama.</p><h3>Ace Bailey - 77 OVR</h3><p>Ace Bailey was the fifth overall draft pick in 2025, but he should've been a higher selection under normal circumstances. Bailey had an interesting pre-draft process, to say the least, that dropped his draft stock slightly, but his talent is undeniable. Bailey should be firmly in the running for Rookie of the Year along with Flagg and Harper.</p><h3>V.J. Edgecombe - 76 OVR</h3><p>There's significant hype around what V.J. Edgecombe could bring to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2025 and beyond. Edgecombe is an intriguing prospect with tools to make an impact on both sides of the ball, and could form a lethal duo with second-year player Jared McCain.</p><h3>Kon Knueppel -75 OVR</h3><p>Kon Knueppel was the fourth overall draft pick, going to the Charlotte Hornets. While the Hornets likely won't be in contention during the 2025 season, Knueppel could find his way into the starting roster based on what we saw in the NBA Summer League, where he was named MVP.</p><h3>Tre Johnson - 75 OVR</h3><p>Tre Johnson was considered a fantastic value pick by the Washington Wizards in the 2025 draft. Coming out of Texas, Johnson could have gone as high as third overall, according to some analysts, but wound up in Washington, where he gets to learn from several savvy veterans and showcase his offensive talent.</p><h3>Khaman Maluach - 74 OVR</h3><p>Khaman Maluach is the first player to be rated outside of where he was drafted. Maluach was drafted tenth overall by the Rockets, but he wound up traded to the Phoenix Suns, where there's room for some young talent to shine after the departure of Kevin Durant.</p><h3>Jeremiah Fears - 73 OVR</h3><p>Jeremiah Fears is up next, coming in at 73 OVR after he was drafted seventh overall by the New Orleans Pelicans. Fears will need some time to develop at the NBA level, but he has the potential to make a huge impact on an always-struggling Pelicans roster.</p><h3>Egor Demin - 72 OVR</h3><p>Egor Demin was drafted by the Brooklyn Nets eighth overall in the draft. Demin has the potential to be one of the best passers in the NBA. However, Demin needs to shore up his shooting ability at the next level if he wants to be rated any higher.</p><h3>Collin Murray-Boyles - 72 OVR</h3><p>Rounding out the list of the top 10 rookies is Toronto Raptors draft pick Collin Murray-Boyles. Coming out of South Carolina, Murray-Boyles was renowned for his defense and niche offensive abilities. Comparisons to Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday were made all throughout the draft process, and that's certainly not a bad mold for the Raptors' rookie.</p><p>That does it for the top 10 list of the best rookies in NBA 2K26.
