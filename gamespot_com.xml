                <p dir="ltr">Even with its multiplayer focus, From Software doesn't look at the newly revealed Elden Ring: Nightreign as a live-service game. The developer wants the co-op action-RPG to be "a complete package out of the box," and publisher Bandai Namco will price the package similarly to Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/elden-ring-nightreign-is-not-what-we-consider-a-live-service-game-says-fromsoftware-we-wanted-to-have-a-game-that-felt-like-a-complete-package/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> spoke with Elden Ring: Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki about whether the multiplayer-centric survival game might borrow live-service mechanics, but that doesn't appear to be the case. "With Nightreign, we wanted to have a game that felt like a complete package out of the box on the day of purchase, so everything is unlockable, everything is contained with that purchase," Ishizaki said. "It's not what we'd consider a live-service game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djtsw5k_DNc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Djtsw5k_DNc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of purchasing Elden Ring: Nightreign, PC Gamer added that Bandai Namco noted the standalone experience will cost roughly the same as the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. That was priced at $40 at launch instead of the typical $60 to $70 for full games these days.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-for-2025-co-op-action-spin-off/1100-6528435/" data-ref-id="1100-6528435">Elden Ring: Nightreign was announced at The Game Awards</a> last night and will be set in the ever-changing location called Limveld. Players will pick from eight different characters before embarking on a perilous adventure by themselves or in a group of three where they try to survive "a three-day-and-night cycle" to ultimately take down the Nightlord.</p><p dir="ltr">Described as a "condensed action-RPG" <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by Bandai Namco</a>, Elden Ring: Nightreign seems to lean into roguelike mechanics with unique runs and relics that carry over with each attempt in Limveld. It's planned to release in 2025.</p>

Among other things, we learned the game will focus on Ciri as the main character. The developers at CD Projekt Red have now discussed why they wanted to have Ciri be the star and have confirmed that, as suspected, Geralt will appear in the game in some fashion.</p><p>Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c1rokekgnY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4c1rokekgnY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ciri was a playable character in some parts of The Witcher 3, and executive producer Gosia MitrÄ™ga said she is "less defined as a character," which gives the developers opportunities for storytelling.</p><p>Geralt, the hero of CD Projekt's previous Witcher games, will appear in The Witcher 4 as well. Kelamba said Geralt is important to the developers and to Ciri, so he's "definitely" going to appear. His voice was heard at the very end of the game's recent trailer, but that's it so far.</p><p>"I can't tell you more, but I think the promise is enough. But we believe that this journey, this new saga, this new trilogy is definitely for her," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232" data-ratio="0.56222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415232"></a><figcaption>Ciri in The Witcher 4's cinematic trailer.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415232-witcher.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4415233,1300-4415234" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415233-witcher1.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4415234-witcher2.jpeg"></figure><p>As Kelamba said, The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games, which are in development alongside CD Projekt's other games, including a Cyberpunk 2077 sequel and a Witcher remake.</p><p>Recently, Geralt voice actor Doug Cockle walked back his comments about Geralt appearing in The Witcher 4 after the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-actor-says-on-second-thought-hes-not-sure-if-geralt-is-actually-in-witcher-4/1100-6528324/" data-ref-id="1100-6528324">"slapped" him for talking about it.</a></p><p>The game's impressive CG trailer at The Game Awards was created by Platige Image and was pre-rendered in a custom version of Unreal Engine 5 running on an "unannounced Nvidia GeForce RTX GPU." The trailer uses assets and models from the game, but is more meant to be a mood piece that aims to show "the kind of experience the game is aspiring to provide."</p>
