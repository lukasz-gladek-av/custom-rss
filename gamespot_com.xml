                <p dir="ltr">Mike Dailly, one of the designers for the original GTA and a co-founding member of Rockstar North, said Rockstar made the right decision to delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> after seeing the upcoming game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">most recent trailer</a>. Dailly made the comments on Bluesky, where he also praised the development team for not giving into greed and releasing a game that the studio knew could be improved.</p><p dir="ltr">Dailly said Rockstar undoubtedly knew GTA 6 would've sold exceptionally well even if it launched in a less-than-ideal state and called the studio's choice to delay it for extra polish "impressive."</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Now that's more like it," Dailly said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj4u37kk22r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his post</a>. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better… Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it. Kudos."</p><p dir="ltr">"Many of us are old enough to remember the debacle that Frontier: Elite II had on the PC, where greed got in the way," Dailly continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Frontier: Elite II launched in 1993, and while the space combat simulator received universal critical praise, it suffered from multiple, often game-breaking bugs on PC. Even those who remember it fondly recall how some of its essential features didn't work correctly, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amiga/comments/u9kerg/frontier_elite_ii_anyone_else_still_get_utterly/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">autopilot or rendering a planet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar didn't publicly give a reason for GTA 6's delay after the announcement. However, as Dailly noted, the most recent version of Vice City looks crisper, and its inhabitants, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">GTA 6's major characters</a> to seemingly unimportant NPCs, move more naturally--in the in-game cutscenes, at least--compared to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">first time Rockstar showed the game off</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">GTA 6's new release date</a> is May 26, 2026, for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC version of GTA 6</a> has not been announced, but is expected at a later, unspecified date.</p>

                <p>The new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> trailer illuminated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">many new details about the highly anticipated open-world game</a>, including the fact that main character Jason is absolutely shredded. The trailer opens with a shirtless Jason climbing down off the roof after doing some repairs. A close-up of Jason reveals he's got cannons for arms, a built back, and some impressive chest gains.</p><p>But how much can Jason bench? A sequence later in the trailer shows Jason on the beach, throwing up some impressive weight. In the trailer, we see Jason benching what appears to be 275lbs. Using weight plates from the amazingly fictional brand "GAINZ," we can see the outer-most plate is 25lbs. The inner ones look like 45-pound plates, so all of that weight combined with the bar (we are assuming it's the standard 45 pounds) and that comes to a mighty 275 pounds.</p><p>No matter what anyone says, a 275-pound bench is <em>impressive</em>. In gym and lifting culture, a bench press of 225 is the standard for what aspiring lifters hope to achieve. Given Jason's general buff-ness, I'm not surprised to see him putting up more, and having a well-rounded physique in general.</p><p>Also worth noting here is Jason's bench press form--it is very good. He takes the bar all the way down to his chest in a slow, controlled manner, making sure to not flare his arms out but keep the tight to his body. He also seems to not drop the weight in a straight line down to his chest. We could learn a thing or two from Jason's form.</p><p>Now, we can't say for sure what Jason's <em>best</em> bench is. It's possible Jason is not maxing out here but instead pumping for volume and muscle stamina. We do hear him grunt a little, but that doesn't mean he's struggling. He gets the weight up pretty easily, after all--earning the attention of a couple women nearby, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449" data-ratio="0.52233009708738" data-width="1030" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489449"></a><figcaption>Jason is getting after it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4489449-screenshot2025-05-06at10.38.24am.png"></figure><p>What I don't like to see here is Jason lifting all this weight without a spotter, or without a rack that has spotter arms. It's dangerous and unsafe to do this. But given Jason's line of work or robbing and shooting people as a drug-runner, it might be one of the safer activities he engages in.</p><p>Jason might be a gym bro, but we also see him in another sequence crashed out on the couch in the middle of the day with beers on his coffee table, so he clearly enjoys partying as well. Another scene shows Jason and Lucia at a club having a grand time. Remember, it's all about balance (minus the crime).</p><p>It's likely pumping out sets at the beach could be an activity in GTA 6, as Rockstar is known to allow players to do much of what they see in trailers for their games. Also, GTA 5 allowed players to hurl some weight around at an <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Muscle_Sands_Gym" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">outdoor gym by the water</a> as well, so it would be in keeping with tradition.</p><p>GTA 6 launches on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That's a while to wait, so in the meantime, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">more than 150 new GTA 6 images </a>in the gallery below.

And in terms of places you'll visit, GTA 6 takes players to Vice City itself, along with the surrounding areas, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/" data-ref-id="2900-6538">a park filled with wildlife.</a></p>

For other games, a publisher might begin preorders after confirming a release date and posting a flashy trailer to capitalize on the hype. But no, that's not the case for GTA 6.</p><p>Although we now know GTA 6 is set for release on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, retailers are not yet taking preorders. You should avoid any retailer currently trying to take your money to reserve the game, as it's likely a scam.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Rest assured, when Rockstar announces preorder details for GTA 6, we'll report back with all the details. In addition to a standard version, it's expected Rockstar will offer premium-edition versions of the game, just like it did with GTA 5.</p><p>For comparison, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o349k552573918/grand-theft-auto-v-now-officially-available-for-preorder.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preorders for GTA 5 opened in November 2012</a>, which was after the first trailer arrived in November 2011. GTA 6, meanwhile, has already had two trailers, the first of which was released in December 2023; the second debuted on May 6, 2025.</p><p>In addition as to when GTA 6 preorders will open, another major unanswered question is how much GTA 6 might cost. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some AAA games jumping from $70 to $80</a>, many are wondering if GTA 6 will follow suit or even potentially go higher, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">like $100</a>, as some believe might happen. GTA 5 launched in 2013 priced at $60; that's about $80 in 2025 with inflation factored in.</p><p>Take-Two, many might recall, was the first major publisher to raise prices for AAA games from $60 to $70 with NBA 2K21. Take-Two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/charging-70-for-nba-2k21-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-was-the-right-call-take-two-ceo-says/1100-6487277/" data-ref-id="1100-6487277">defended the price hike</a> and said it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-coming-take-two-sees-no-pushback-on-70-games/1100-6514323/" data-ref-id="1100-6514323">generally accepted by fans.</a></p><p>GTA 6 is set in Vice City, which is a stand-in for Miami. The game also takes players to the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6538"> surrounding area in the fictional state of Leonida</a>, which is inspired by Florida. Beyond main characters Jason and Lucia, players will meet a variety of other supporting characters, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-grand-theft-auto-6-character-revealed/2900-6537/" data-ref-id="2900-6537">including a conspiracy theorist.</a></p><p>While we wait for more information about GTA 6, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-screenshots-images/2900-6525/" data-ref-id="2900-6525">150+ screenshots from the game</a> in the gallery below.</p>

A genuine treat for anyone who enjoys stealth and meticulously planning their next move, the game was sadly the final title developed by Mimimi, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/weeks-after-releasing-an-acclaimed-game-a-15-year-old-studio-is-shutting-down/1100-6517269/" data-ref-id="1100-6517269">as the studio shut down several weeks later</a>.

                <p>Bungie has revealed its plans for the next long story arc for Destiny 2. The developers have revealed a "multi-year saga" in the form of the Fate Saga. The beginning of this new chapter of Destiny's story, there will be four expansions to start us off known as the Year of Prophecy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">Starting on July 15, 2025 with The Edge of Fate</a>, players will journey to the mysterious planetoid Kepler and find more questions than answers about the universe at large. After that on December 2, 2025, we will get the expansion Renegades. As per Bungie's new content roadmap plans, there will now be two expansions a year going forward. So now with more densely-packed expansions than what players have seen with Episodes and less waiting time, more content will be seen quickly rather than the 1-2 year gap between expansions as before.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In between each expansion there will also be what Bungie is dubbing "Major Updates," with overhauls to the sandbox, new events, modifier and challenge updates, new gear and Artifact mods, and more. On September 9, 2025, the first major update of the Season of Reclamation, titled Ash &amp; Iron, will release. Then, as part of Renegades and the Season of Lawless, the Shadow &amp; Order update will drop on March 3, 2026. The most-enticing detail here is that each major update will not cost anything, nor will it be vaulted or taken away. Major updates will be free to all Destiny 2 players, and the content they bring will always be part of the game at large. These updates will be approximately the size of the Into the Light seasonal update with lots of events and new content to find.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not all, as we already have names for the next expansions for the Year of Prophecy going into 2026 as well. Shattered Cycle will launch in Summer 2026. Finally, in Winter 2026 will be the finale of the Year of Prophecy, The Alchemist.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie have said they promise to show lots of new destinations, new gameplay features, and even some returning favorites. Included among all of the massive updates coming starting this July is a customizable difficulty for destinations, which we detail in this article <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">here</a>.</p>
