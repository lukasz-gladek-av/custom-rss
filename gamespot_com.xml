                <p>It's a been a long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, but the return of bounty hunter Samus Aran is just a few weeks away. Now, Nintendo has dropped an extended trailer for Metroid Prime 4 that sets up the story, shows off her new powers, and reveals that she does have allies on the planet Viewros. What she doesn't have is a way to get off the hostile world that's trying to kill her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBR0H1F5hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mBR0H1F5hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the opening minutes of the trailer, Samus answers a distress call from a Galactic Federation research center that comes under attack by her rival, Sylux. During the battle, Samus is somehow transported to an unknown and hostile world called Viewros. And some of the Galactic Federation troops survived to make the trip as well. But without a ship, this may be a one-way journey for Samus and her allies.</p><p>Samus' standard abilities are back in this game, and she picks up a few new skills including psychic powers that can direct her shots with precision or operate the long-abandoned machinery on Viewros. GameSpot recently had a chance to try out those psychic powers during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/" data-ref-id="1100-6536193">a hands-on experience with Metroid Prime 4</a>. </p><p>There are several different biomes on the planet, abandoned factories, and an open-world desert that Samus can travel across on her motorcycle, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">the Vi-0-La</a>. Samus can even summon the Vi-0-La while exploring the various factories, and the game shifts from first-person to third-person in these scenes.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4 will be available on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4, but only the latter has mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 that can give Samus even greater control of her aim. The video demonstrates how players can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">swap from standard to mouse controls</a> at will.</p>

                <p>After getting leaked earlier this week, Epic Games has revealed that Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator will join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on November 14 as an purchasable skin.</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1989332670351102047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a seven-second teaser video</a> of the "Don't Tap the Glass" rapper's skin. In the clip, we get a look at two outfits for Tyler, the Creator: his green "Chromakopia" getup and an ensemble that closely resembles his "Wolf" or "Cherry Bomb" days.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/tyler-the-creator-fortnite-skin-leaked-all-cosmetics-outfits-prices-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 12 Vice story</a>, prolific dataminer NotPaloLeaks unveiled this Tyler, the Creator collaboration in an X post on November 11. As Vice speculates, his skins could cost 1,500 V-Bucks, and his arrival may come with cosmetics like weapon wraps, pickaxes, backpacks, jam tracks, and emotes. The official Fortnite X account hasn't confirmed this yet, but Tyler, the Creator hits the in-game shop on November 14, so it won't be much longer until everything is made clearer.</p><p>Regardless of what comes with Tyler, the Creator's arrival, the Fortnite community is losing its mind. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1owxaqw/the_wait_is_over_tylerthecreator_is_landing_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent post in r/FortniteBR about the reveal</a>, the comments are filled with excitement. "Pretty cool. Was hoping for Chromakopia," one Redditor said. "God yes," another user chimed.</p><p>The sentiment is about the same on X. In the replies to the teaser video, users expressed their enthusiasm for the skin. "Finally," <a href="https://x.com/G_BoysAccount/status/1989336309735841871" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one poster said with a Family Guy GIF</a>. "It's enough to make a grown man cry," <a href="https://x.com/AbrahamDia11852/status/1989333187290435877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied another</a>.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is pleased with the collab. Some in that r/FortniteBR post dismissed the skin. Meanwhile, users in the replies to Fortnite's X post were taken aback by his appearance, with one poster calling the skin "<a href="https://x.com/SrSonicCraft1/status/1989333226704249240" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tyron the Architect</a>" because of the face he makes when diving from the Battle Bus in the teaser video.</p><p>Tyler, the Creator joins Fortnite just as Springlefield continues taking over the battle royale shooter. The Simpsons have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">running all over Fortnite Island</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/son-of-a-diddly-ned-flanders-has-eliminated-33000-unneighborly-fortnite-players/1100-6536031/" data-ref-id="1100-6536031">Ned Flanders in particular piling up the bodies</a>. However, Fox's cartoon won't stick around for much longer; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">Season 7 is slated to start on November 29</a>, with Fortnite Island possibly taking on a distinctive LA flair and new collabs--from Kill Bill to SpongeBob SquarePants--hinted at joining the game.</p>

                <p>Sony and NCSoft just announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/" data-ref-id="1100-6536174">Horizon spin-off called Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-franchise-was-created-with-multiplayer-in-mind-says-guerrilla-games-boss/1100-6536213/" data-ref-id="1100-6536213">mobile-first, multiplayer-focused MMO</a> that's in the works for mobile and PC--but not Sony's flagship PlayStation 5 console.</p><p>Executive producer Sunggu Lee <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to IGN</a> about the game and answered some questions people might be wondering, like if Aloy is in the game, what the game's inspirations are, how combat works, and more.</p><p>Asked if Aloy, or other well-known Horizon characters, are in Horizon Steel Frontiers, Lee said, "We haven't finalized whether characters from the original game will appear, so it's too early to share any specific plans."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another question that came up is where Horizon Steel Frontiers fits within the wider Horizon universe. Lee said it is indeed set inside the Horizon world, but in a new place, the Deadlands, which is inspired by Arizona and New Mexico. "While Aloy and her allies are fighting for the fate of the world in the north, the southern Deadlands face a new threat. Players step into the role of machine hunters drawn to this dangerous frontier," Lee said.</p><p>As for the Horizon Steel Frontiers combat mechanics, Lee said the MMO and the main game series from Guerrilla share the same core idea of fighting big machines. But the combat systems are "quite different," Lee said. "In Steel Frontiers, it’s all about managing distance and making quick decisions--when to attack and when to dodge. We've kept the tension and excitement of the original hunts, but redesigned the combat to deliver a fresh experience that's optimized for multiplayer hunting action," Lee said.</p><p>We also learned in the interview that NCSoft was inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series for Steel Frontiers. "Monster Hunter was definitely one of the key inspirations for Steel Frontiers. When we started expanding Horizon's core concept of hunting massive machines into a multiplayer experience, the cooperative hunting system from the Monster Hunter series felt like a natural reference point," Lee said.</p><p>What's more, Lee discussed the differences between the mobile and PC versions of Horizon Frontiers. "Mobile offers quick, on-the-go session play, while PC provides a richer, more strategic combat experience--each platform playing to its strengths," Lee said.</p><p>Steel Frontiers does not have a release date yet. For fans of the main Horizon series, developer Guerrilla says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/" data-ref-id="1100-6536178">more games are coming, including a possible multiplayer game. </a></p>

                <p>Dragami Games has announced that the upcoming Switch 2 port of Lollipop Chainsaw has been delayed. It was previously set to launch this November but is now coming in "early 2026."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The developer said</a> the delay was due to the volume of requests for a physical edition of the game's RePOP remaster version. The studio wanted to align the digital and physical releases, so it opted to delay all versions to 2026.</p><p>"We sincerely apologize for the extended wait and any inconvenience this may cause. We appreciate your understanding and continued support," Dragami said.</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suda51-and-james-gunn-wont-be-involved-in-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake/1100-6505128/" data-ref-id="1100-6505128">neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the remaster</a>.</p><p>The RePOP edition originally came out in 2024 for Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The new edition includes "the latest graphics," along with "speedier chainsaw action." For anyone unaware, Lollipop Chainsaw tells the story of Juliet Starling, a student who loves cheerleading and killing zombies.</p><p>The Switch 2 is soaring right now, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">passing 10 million units sold</a> to become Nintendo's fastest-selling console ever.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Mario Kart DS is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, November 14, 2025. Below, we examine how the fan community has kept the game alive, and online, long after official servers were retired.</em></p><p dir="ltr">When Mario Kart DS launched in 2005, it felt like a glimpse into the future. For the first time, Nintendo’s chaotic, shell-filled racer could be played online, pitting players from around the world against each other in real-time competition. It was a leap few handheld games had dared to make at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Two decades later, the official Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers that powered those matchups are long gone, but the race never really stopped. Through fan-built tools, open-source servers, and emulation projects, Mario Kart DS remains alive and well--still spinning its wheels in the hands of a dedicated community that refuses to let it drift into the past.</p><p dir="ltr">When the Nintendo DS debuted, it was marketed as a “third pillar” for the company--a strange, dual-screen experiment meant to sit alongside the GameCube and Game Boy Advance. But with Mario Kart DS, the touch screen rarely came into play. The game focused the series’ easy-to-pick-up gameplay with a forward-thinking approach that accelerated Mario Kart into the future. GameSpot, in fact, loved the game in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mario Kart DS is without a doubt one of the best games to hit the Nintendo DS to date," GameSpot's reviewer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-ds-review/1900-6139765/">wrote</a>. "The game plays every bit as well as any of its predecessors, and adds just enough new features to the mix to make it worthy of your attention, even if you're still playing any of those games on a regular basis. The online play is undoubtedly the icing on an especially yummy cake, and even if you're not in a position to sample said icing, a yummy cake without icing is still a yummy cake."</p><p dir="ltr">Using Nintendo’s Wi-Fi Connection service, players could race online via local hotspots or home internet connections. It wasn’t perfect--online matchmaking was limited to a handful of tracks, and finding friends required clunky friend codes--but it was enough to ignite a new kind of competition. Suddenly, players could test their drifting skills against strangers halfway across the globe. For many, it was their first taste of online console gaming at all.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pC4Ohj0jdBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pC4Ohj0jdBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Beyond its online capabilities, Mario Kart DS also raised the bar for what handheld racing could be. It introduced retro cups, reimagining classic tracks from previous entries. It popularized snaking, a technique where skilled players could chain boosts by quickly alternating drifts, giving the game a competitive depth.</p><p dir="ltr">When Nintendo shut down its Wi-Fi Connection servers in 2014, it seemed like the end of an era. Online play for Mario Kart DS--and dozens of other Nintendo titles--was suddenly gone. But like any good racer, fans found a way to take a shortcut.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just found a way to play Mario Kart DS online again. It's really cool that you can still do this,' one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarioKartDS/comments/1cfjera/playing_mario_kart_ds_online_in_2024/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2024. "It's not as active as the Wii, but it's actually pretty easy to find a match."</p><p dir="ltr">Through reverse engineering and open-source initiatives like Wiimmfi and AltWFC, the game’s online features were kept alive by the community. Players could still race together. The process wasn’t always simple--it required custom patches or modified DNS settings--but it worked.</p><p dir="ltr">Today, fan communities continue to organize races and tournaments. Whenever players went online to post that they found a new way to play Mario kart DS online, but that they couldn't find other players, other Mario Kart DS fans pointed them towards a thriving <a href="https://discord.gg/mario-kart-ds-network-569870981213061120" rel="nofollow ">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of community and legacy is what drives many of these projects. In an era where online games can disappear with the flip of a server switch, Mario Kart DS has become a case study in fan-powered preservation. It’s proof that players can keep a game alive long after its corporate support ends--through passion, a little technical skill, and sheer determination.</p><p dir="ltr">Even by today’s standards, Mario Kart DS feels remarkably tight. Its track design, item balance, and snappy controls strike a near-perfect blend of skill and chaos. The game’s focus on pure mechanics--no anti-gravity, bikes, motion controls, or touch-screen gameplay--makes it a favorite for players who crave the series’ classic feel.</p><p dir="ltr">Its simplicity is part of its staying power. Modern entries like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Mario Kart World are spectacular in scope, but DS captures a more stripped-down energy--a focus on short bursts of fun that perfectly fit the handheld format. Races are quick, items are well-tuned, and the roster, while smaller with 12 standard racers including most of Mario's immediate family, friends, and rivals, is iconic.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s also a game that rewards mastery. Snaking and mini-turbo management turned what looked like a casual party racer into a surprisingly deep competitive title. The best players could maintain near-constant boosts, flying through tracks with dizzying speed. Nintendo eventually toned this down in later games, but among longtime fans, Mario Kart DS remains the “technical” entry--the one that truly separated the pros from the pack.</p><p dir="ltr">As Mario Kart DS turns 20, its community, while small, is firmly in cruise control. Players continue to introduce newcomers to its underground online scene. For many, keeping the game alive isn’t just nostalgia--it’s a statement about access in the digital age.</p><p dir="ltr">The future of Mario Kart will likely continue to evolve, beyond the sandbox experiment of Mario Kart World and the fun augmented reality of Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit. But in many ways, Mario Kart DS set the standard. It proved that online play could work on a handheld and that great design never goes out of style.</p><p dir="ltr">Twenty years on, the finish line isn't even on the track. The race, at least for now, feels endless. The drivers are still out hugging turns on Delfino Square and dodging obstacles on Waluigi Pinball with their feet firmly planted on the gas pedal.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Image Credit: XCageGame on YouTube</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Starting with Horizon Zero Dawn and followed up with Horizon Forbidden West, the PlayStation franchise has seen players following protagonist Aloy on a single-player adventure. With the recent reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-is-skipping-ps5-for-now/1100-6536174/">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, the focus changes from a solo affair to an MMO. But Guerrilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek has stated the series started with multiplayer in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-horizon-adventures-review-for-buildin-jest/1900-6418316/">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> was apparently Guerilla dipping its toes in the water with multiplayer, according to van Beek <a href="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" rel="nofollow ">on X</a>. But going forward, the studio will focus more on this social aspect. "From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game," wrote van Beek. "Lego Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we're taking a bigger one. There is much more to come, and we're excited to show you what is coming."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/janbartvanbeek/status/1989193333491790157" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From the first moment we imagined Horizon, we always thought about it as a multiplayer game. <br>LEGO Horizon Adventures was our first small step, with Steel Frontiers we’re taking a bigger one.

That would be a first for the franchise, as even the spin-off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-new-heights/1900-6418028/" data-ref-id="1900-6418028">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> was released for PlayStation VR 2. The MMO looks a bit inspired by the Monster Hunter series and will feature large-scale raids. Meanwhile, Sony has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">filed a lawsuit against Tencent over Light of Motiram</a>, arguing the game is a "slavish clone" of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">As van Beek implies, multiplayer looks here to stay with the Horizon franchise. In fact, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-horizon-games-are-coming-including-a-non-mmo-multiplayer-game-it-seems/1100-6536178/">reported that a multiplayer Horizon game is the next project from Guerrilla</a>. There is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a live-action Horizon movie in the works</a>, though no directors, writers, or cast members have been announced.</p>
