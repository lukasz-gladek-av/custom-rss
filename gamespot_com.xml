                <p dir="ltr">Advancing through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681580">Grounded 2</a> campaign will eventually task you with hacking two O.R.C. transmitters. These transmitters can be tricky to reach, especially if you don't have the right gear to tackle their locations. In this guide, we'll show you how to reach the O.R.C. transmitters you need to hack in the Signals and Stashes mission.</p><p dir="ltr">The transmitters are located at the Trash Can and Picnic Table points of interest, and you'll find the guide for both below. Each location has O.R.C. enemies (the bugs with purple glowing receiver devices) you might need to fight off, so you'll want to be prepared with your weapon of choice and some bandages. You'll also get an additional side objective for each O.R.C. transmitter you hack, and we'll discuss those locations as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Picnic_Table_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Picnic Table O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861"></a><figcaption>Picnic Table POI location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Picnic Table POI is located just north of the Snackbar, as shown in the image above. This is the area of the map with the red and white-checkered tablecloth.</p><p dir="ltr">Before venturing to the Picnic Table, you'll want to make sure you're geared up to combat the game's chill effect. You'll be navigating through a cooler, and you'll freeze without some sort of protection. It's best to have armor that helps protect against cold or at least a few pieces of spicy candy.</p><p dir="ltr">For the cold-resistant gear, you'll want at least the Mitey Muffs headpiece and the Fuzzy Mukluks. These are the earliest options available to you.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mitey Muffs require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">5- Mite Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">5 - Grub Hide</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Fuzzy Mukluks require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 - Bee Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Bug Rubber</li><li dir="ltr">3 - Lingonberry Leather</li><li dir="ltr">2- Silk Rope</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865"></a><figcaption>Follow up this side of the tablecloth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you're geared up for the cold, head to the Picnic Table location on the map. You'll want to walk or ride your buggy up the red and white-checkered tablecloth. You'll have a few enemies to fight along the way, including mites and spiders.</p><p dir="ltr">The very top of the tablecloth is blocked off, so eventually you'll need to go another way to reach the top of the table. You'll notice there's a gap you need to cross to continue along the path.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864"></a><figcaption>Tablecloth tunnel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The safest way to cross over is to slip under the tunnel created by the cloth, and you'll fight a few spiders here as well. This will lead you to a wooden beam you can cross to reach the other side of the table. Several roach nymphs are scurrying around this new area, but you can ignore them. They won't fight unless you instigate it.</p><p dir="ltr">Your objective marker will point you to the entrance for a cooler. This is an outdoor cooler for drinks, and it's ice cold inside. You'll want to make sure you have your outdoor gear equipped or spicy candy ready.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868"></a><figcaption>Transmitter on top of Picnic Table</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigate through the passageway inside the cooler, and you'll finally reach the top of the picnic table. Here you'll see the O.R.C. transmitter and need to interact with it to hack it. Of course, you'll need to fight off O.R.C. ladybugs and possibly spiders in order to reach it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pines">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pines</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873"></a><figcaption>Red arrow marks the O.R.C. Pine Hill location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Picnic Table transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the Pines." This isn't too hard to complete. An objective marker should lead you into the Pines section of the map, where you'll find spiders and Lingonberries growing. However, this objective marker was not showing for me, so if this is also the case for you, the area is found near the Ranger Outpost: Pine Hill. Just head to the path on the left side of the outpost entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">This leads you to an area where you'll need to fight off Orb Weaver O.R.C. enemies and hack another transmitter. Spears and daggers can work well here. This isn't terribly difficult, but make sure you have bandages just in case.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth harvesting the Lingonberries while you're there. These are an important resource, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-lingonberries-and-blueberries-for-leather-in-grounded-2/1100-6533438/" data-ref-id="1100-6533438">Lingonberry leather</a> is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Garbage_Can_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875"></a><figcaption>Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter location on map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To reach the Garbage Can, you'll first need to get some gear to help you survive the area's toxic gas. I recommended a gas mask for the garbage can area. You can use the Gastro Goo smoothies, but these have such a limited time of effect. Either way, you'll need to kill a stinkbug to craft what you need. I'd also recommended collecting a few dandelion tufts. It's really easy to fall when navigating the top of the garbage can.</p><p dir="ltr">The gas mask requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Weevil Nose</li><li dir="ltr">4 - Gnat Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Crude Rope</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Part</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Gasto Goo smoothie requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Gas Sack</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Roach Chunk</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Aphid Honeydew</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you're prepared to survive the gas, head on over to the Garbage Can POI marked on the image above. This location is best navigated with the Red Soldier Ant buggy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877"></a><figcaption>Climb the Garbage Can POI here</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll want to circle around the can until you find the ledge near it. From here, you can jump onto a small branch growing into the side of the garbage can. Then, jump onto a banana. While standing on the banana, turn around and jump on the white, plastic spork. You'll continue to follow this narrow path around the can, working your way up by navigating limbs and ropes until you reach the top.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878"></a><figcaption>Navigating the branches around Garbage Can POI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll see the O.R.C. transmitter at the very top of the trash pile. You can potentially sneak up here without enemies spotting you, or you might get caught battling an O.R.C cockroach. Either way, you need to survive and interact with the device to hack it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pond">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pond</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881"></a><figcaption>Location for O.R.C soldiers by the pond</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Garbage Can transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the pond." This isn't too hard to complete. The object marker leads you to a section of the map filled with berry bushes.</p><p dir="ltr">The berries are guarded by O.R.C. bees, so you want to be prepared to fight and kill them. Using a bow and arrow can be useful here for fighting at range. You'll also want some bandages. All you technically need to do is take out the O.R.C. bees, but it's worth sticking around to also harvest the blueberries.</p><p dir="ltr">Blueberries are an important resource, as blueberry leather is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p>

                <p>It is no secret that 2021's Battlefield 2042 was not the success that EA and developer DICE hoped for.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another producer, David Sirland, said the studio spent a lot of time thinking about the core pillars of Battlefield--destruction, classes, and vehicles--and designing Battlefield 6 in service to those.</p><p>Christofi said it was important to define what Battlefield's core tenets were and Sirland said it was also important to nail down what they are not.</p><p>"We needed to define that clearly, because that guides us for a long time, like 10-plus years, or whatever. It should be that stringent. Sure, you can amend it and change it, but everyone on the team should be able to feel that and be like, 'Okay, I know what we're doing,'" he said. "So, when I get a new idea, does it fit? Yes, cool. It's not like it tells exactly what to do, but it should tell you the lane to stay within. I think that is what's needed. Because I think that maybe, if anything, for 2042, that wasn't super clear, right, especially not over time. It was more of a reaction to something that didn’t work and we changed it as fast as possible."</p><p>In 2022, DICE general manager Rebecka Coutaz reacted to Battlefield 2042's poor launch, saying, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">"Everybody was disappointed."</a> Following the game's release. DICE shuffled its top leaders, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/" data-ref-id="1100-6498521">former GM Oskar Gabrielson leaving the studio and other major changes in a big shakeup.</a></p><p>EA also created a new label, Battlefield Studios, to oversee the development of the brand. DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive all work under Battlefield Studios. The former general manager of Call of Duty--Byron Beede--is now the general manager of Battlefield. The future of Battlefield is also being developed under the leadership of EA executive Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty boss as well.</p><p>So far, EA appears to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">saying and doing the right things with Battlefield 6</a> to help win fans back, but only time will tell if the game can stick the landing and find a place in an ultra-competitive marketplace. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In the wake of the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered's release</a>, the developers behind Skylivion are making clear that their ambitious mod over 10 years in the making is far more than just a graphics update: It "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion looks to recreate the 2006 open-world RPG in the engine of 2011's Skyrim, albeit with new content and gameplay changes. The mod is still slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">release in 2025</a>, and in the latest development diary for the project, the TESRenewal mod team behind Skyblivion answers the question that has been top of mind since Oblivion Remastered released in April--what's the point of Skyblivion when the official remaster is already available?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MH-BqXk2WA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The answer is simple," the dev diary states. "Skyblivion is a full-scale remake that reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards. While the official remaster impressively upgrades textures and assets, Skyblivion introduces entirely newly designed areas, dungeons, cities, gameplay enhancements, and much more."</p><p dir="ltr">Far from just Oblivion running in a new engine, the devs state that "every fort, home, cave, and landscape has been thoughtfully redesigned."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've infused this sort of creative detail to breathe new life into a beloved classic--one that is nearly two decades old," the dev diary states.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the dev diary provides ample evidence to back up the team's "full-scale remake" claims, as it highlights how it remade the city of Anvil to feature a large harbor and is introducing a new Oblivion biome to make closing Oblivion gates "less repetitive and monotonous."</p><p dir="ltr">An overhaul to the original game's "unique" items also coming with Skyblivion. The devs note how in the original game, most unique items were unique in "name only" and were largely just modified versions of existing items recolored with a slight stat boost. In Skylivion, unique items will be "truly unique," with updated appearances and, in the case of many unique weapons, new attack animations to help players "diversify" their playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">Previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ambitious-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-shows-off-20-minutes-of-quest-gameplay/1100-6525882/" data-ref-id="1100-6525882">Skyblivion updates</a> outlined how it will include new quests, monsters, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and even new music, as well as updates to the game's menus and UI.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion doesn't have specific release date, but the dev diary states the team is "confident" it will meet its goal of releasing this year. The mod will be free to download for those who own both Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're excited to show off more soon and get Skyblivion into your hands, but we've still got work to do in finalizing key areas and giving Skyblivion proper quality and assurance to make sure we all get the game fans deserve," the video concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">In light of Oblivion Remastered's reveal, Skyblivion's project lead said the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster was a "win-win" for the community</a>. Bethesda later gifted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Portal was introduced in Battlefield 2042 as a means to allow players to create and customize their own gametypes with custom rules and settings. In Battlefield 6, it goes further and allows players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609">make their own maps.</a></p><p>The nice thing about a server browser, fans say, is that it allows players the freedom to choose to play whatever they want, on any map they want, in a region near them with an ideal ping. While there may not be a server browser for official servers in Battlefield 6, it's likely fans will do the work themselves and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1metpxq/no_server_browser_for_official_servers_so_its/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create copies of the official servers</a>. That may not be an ideal experience, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 producer Alexia Christofi addressed the fan discussion about server browsers, asking people to send in feedback as to why an official server browser is so important to them. Responses <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951863732260286563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">flooded in</a>, and Christofi highlighted the key takeaways.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898821539017159" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Feels like your most important things are:<br>- persistent servers<br>- a sense of community and a way to play together<br>- being able to choose specific maps/modes<br>- being able to filter by ping/server fullness <br>- support for low pop regions<br>More to share on this in future. But..

Christofi acknowledged, "Yes, it's via Portal and shows only community experiences," but pointed out that players can earn full XP gains with these modes and they will be promoted "front and center" in Battlefield 6's main menu.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Again, more to share on this in the future - but seeing all your replies I think what we have caters to the majority of use cases.

                <p>Pac-Man made the jump to 3D way back in 1999 with Pac-Man World, which earned solid reviews and went on to become something of a cult classic. It would later earn a remake, Pac-Man World Re-Pac, in 2022. A similar thing is now happening with the original game's sequel, Pac-Man World 2. The 3D platformer launched for PS2, GameCube, and Xbox in 2002, and more than two decades later, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK7YV5RB,B0FK8D2W2C,B0FK7ZW7F3,B0FK7Z44K4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is bringing it to a whole new audience with new features, enhanced graphics, and voice acting. Preorders are open ahead of its September 26 release on PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, Switch, and PC, with two options available: a $30 standard edition and a $40 Digital Deluxe Edition.

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Season 5 update arrives on August 7, bringing the Reckoning as the final Zombies map for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>. Treyarch has <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" rel="nofollow ">released a new video</a> to discuss some of the new features and details players can expect for this Zombies finale, which includes parachutes, upgradable traps, and the brand-new Wonder Weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's latest video gives a deep dive into the Reckoning map, which takes place at Liberty Fall's Janus Towers location. The map features three tall towers for players to fight the undead. These spaces can be navigated with teleporters, anti-gravity launchers, and parachutes, marking the first time parachutes are featured on a traditional round-based Zombies map.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Get an inside look at the conclusion of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> Zombies 🧟‍♂️</p><p>Treyarch takes us inside Reckoning, breaking down the final map and the new features that deliver an unforgettable finale 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/pdQpcmv1XV" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/pdQpcmv1XV</a></p></div>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1952399134570553475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The video also teases that parts of the Reckoning map will feature low gravity. This seems to include the map's Pack-a-Punch room, as the Pack-a-Punch machine can be seen floating around with some zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new feature is the ability to upgrade traps on the map. Players can interact with a new machine on the map called Caster, which lets them upgrade various traps. The video shows off one of the new traps, which is a wall-mounted cannon that shoots dark aether energy, and the developer says the trap can be updated with parts to make it more effective.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows the map's unique Wonder Weapon in action. The Reckoning map features the Gorgofex, which is a pistol-type weapon that fires Aether-based energy. This Wonder Weapon will feature two possible upgrades to make it even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Uberklaus is the name for the map's new elite enemy type. Uberklaus will have two phases to fight. The enemy starts off inside a giant mech suit, and dealing enough damage will cause the robot inside to eject from the suit for the second fight phase.</p><p dir="ltr">This Zombies conclusion arrives along with plenty of new updates for multiplayer and Warzone. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/">Call of Duty Season 5</a> brings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-5-every-new-map-and-mode-coming-to-black-ops-6-multiplayer/2900-6825/">new maps and modes</a> to Black Ops 6 multiplayer, and the rooftop of Warzone's Stadium POI is finally opening up to provide a new playable area.</p>

                <p>Blizzard's dark fantasy ARPG series Diablo is getting the tabletop RPG treatment, and it promises to have players geared up and ready to hack and slash through armies of demons from "session zero."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glasscannonunplugged/706666020?ref=36816m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> page for Diablo: The Roleplaying Game recently went live, and while the campaign won't officially begin until this fall, it does provide some details on what players can expect from the TTRPG adaptation. The game comes from Glass Cannon, which has made board game versions of plenty of video games in the past, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-the-board-game-is-planned-for-later-this-year/1100-6511682/" data-ref-id="1100-6511682">Apex Legends</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">As for how the TTRPG will try to capture the spirit of the Diablo video games, Glass Cannon name drops a few Diablo classes players will be able to play as, including Barbarian, Druid, Necromancer, Rogue, and Sorcerer (the same classes available at launch in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>). More importantly, it gives a glimpse of how it is looking to adapt Diablo's fast-and-frenetic ARPG action into a tabletop format.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542744"></a><figcaption>A look at some of the miniatures included as part of Diablo: The Roleplaying Game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4542744-diabloroleplayinggamekickstarter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For starters, Glass Cannon promises there won't be "inexperienced and squishy first-level characters." Instead, player characters will begin their adventure "fully equipped as a seasoned hero ready to live the epic-level dream of TTRPGs from session zero." Battles will see players fighting through "endless mobs in fast paced, tactical combat where story, stats, and synergies hold sway." There will additionally be a "push-your-luck" mechanic inspired by the Diablo universe's Eternal Conflict between the forces of heaven and hell.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo: The Roleplaying Game will sport a 300-page core rulebook that will provide game rules, lore, and artwork. It will be accompanied by a number of one-shot adventures for players to experience from writers like Graham McNeill, known for their work in the Warhammer universe, and MJ Newman of Arkham Horror fame. The game's rules will use a custom d6 dice-pool system and will also come with detailed miniatures, previews of which can be seen on the Kickstarter page.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when in the Diablo timeline the Diablo TTRPG will be set, it looks to take place around the time of Diablo 4, with marketing material showing Lilith and featuring taglines like "be beautiful in sin." The Kickstarter page states that players will be able to "explore Sanctuary's diverse lands and history spanning the entire franchise."</p><p dir="ltr">That's about all the details known so far, but those interested in learning more can sign up to be notified about the Kickstarter campaign's upcoming launch.</p><p dir="ltr">In Diablo video game news, various content creators were treated to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">secret glimpse at Diablo 4's future</a>, even as Blizzard itself states that there <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/those-hoping-for-major-diablo-4-update-news-may-have-to-keep-waiting/1100-6533522/" data-ref-id="1100-6533522">won't be any major Diablo 4 news</a> ahead of Season 10 in September. Diablo 4 was also recently cleared to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release in China</a> after receiving governmental approval.</p>
