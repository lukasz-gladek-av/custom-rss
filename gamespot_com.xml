                <p>Nintendo is billing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/" data-ref-id="5000-671281">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> as "the story leading into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>," giving players the chance to participate in the Imprisoning War that occurred during Hyrule's ancient past. According to developer Koei Tecmo, the game will also delve further into the lore and characters from this mysterious time period.</p><p>"This game takes place during the Imprisoning War, which is shown in fragments in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom," Koei Tecmo's Yosuke Hayashi said during Nintendo's latest Creator's Voice video. "In this Hyrule Warriors game, you'll see how the people of Hyrule contended with the threat of the original Ganondorf."</p><p>Though the war is the focal point of the story, Age of Imprisonment will also offer a deeper look at Hyrule itself. "As a story that you can only fully experience here, it doesn't just depict the battles of the Imprisoning War via a Warriors game. It also shows life in the kingdom of Hyrule after Princess Zelda is sent back in time," Koei Tecmo producer Ryota Matsushita explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jT8ojj0HrzA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jT8ojj0HrzA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Moreover, the game will shed light on some mysterious characters from this time period. As previously confirmed, King Rauru and Mineru will both be playable characters, but Matsushita teases that players will "also get to know the four masked sages from The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom."</p><p>Like previous Warriors games, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is a large-scale action game that pits players against hundreds of enemies at a time, with more appearing on the battlefield than before thanks to Switch 2's added horsepower. "Nintendo Switch 2 has made it possible to include lots of enemies in our Warriors games," Matsushita explained.</p><p>"At the same time, it was also important that you could play with higher frame rates than the Nintendo Switch system. We were able to achieve that with this game," Hayashi added.</p><p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment is slated to arrive "this winter," while the Switch 2 itself will launch on June 5 for $450. Nintendo is also offering a limited-time Mario Kart World bundle for $500, but this will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-switch-2-bundle-will-be-discontinued-this-fall/1100-6530950/" data-ref-id="1100-6530950">only be available through Fall 2025</a>.</p>

                <p>Avowed game director Carrie Patel has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carrie-patel-80003aa_im-happy-to-share-that-im-starting-a-new-activity-7330425052565307393-bTzY/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAe8N2cBgr8yAdDlzNawvOXeqb-JdsGiQC4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that she's left developer Obsidian to become a game director at Oxenfree developer Night Dive, which is owned by Netflix.</p><p>Avowed launched in February for Xbox and PC, and it was a critical success. Microsoft, which owns Obsidian, never announced any stats about the game's commercial success, though.</p><p>After launch, Patel said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-want-more-avowed-so-does-the-games-director/1100-6529664/" data-ref-id="1100-6529664">she would like to see Obsidian spend more time in the Avowed world</a>, with many taking that to mean a sequel. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," she said.</p><p><span>Avowed</span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-was-originally-pitched-with-multiplayer-like-destiny-mixed-with-skyrim/1100-6529651/"> was originally pitched as a multiplayer-centric game that married Destiny with Skyrim</a><span>. That was before Patel came on board as the game's director and helped lead the project through a </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MDE2MDg3MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQwNzY1NjcyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUzFPT0xUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.FhUrXseBBb83k69Ovuo9PgY3sOuBdW-owuWeanAYc5o&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">major development pivot.</a></p><p>Patel had worked at Obsidian for more than 11 years, contributing to games like Pillars of Eternity 1+2 and The Outer Worlds before becoming game director of Avowed. Obsidian is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is set for release later this year. </p><p>Patel leaving Obsidian doesn't necessarily say anything about prospects for more Avowed, or anything else for that matter. People leave their jobs for any number of reasons.</p><p>While there is no word yet on a potential Avowed sequel, Obsidian is supporting the game with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-2025-roadmap-includes-new-game-plus-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6531578/" data-ref-id="1100-6531578">major updates in the summer and fall</a> that will add things like new NPC abilities and behaviors, as well as new game plus and photo modes.</p><p>Patel joins Netflix at a time of change and upheaval at the company with regards to gaming. The company already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">shuttered its AAA game studio</a> and Netflix's gaming output is focusing more on mobile and social games of late. However, Netflix's top gaming boss says fans should understand that it takes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-gaming-boss-wants-to-lower-friction-and-bypass-expensive-consoles/1100-6530464/" data-ref-id="1100-6530464">"time, stubbornness, and investment to get great results."</a></p><p>It's not immediately clear what project Patel is the game director of at Netflix. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

That's a very good start for a game considering the AAA titles it's competing with.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> RoadCraft Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>To a certain extent, RoadCraft is a crafting game, except it stays close to reality. Players can't simply take short cuts and skip past the clean up stage. Once the debris has been taken away, the rebuilding process begins. Laying down new roads is a part of that, but not the end. RoadCraft is designed to let the players decide where everything should go, and how they want to put it there.</p><p>RoadCraft allows players to utilize cranes, haulers, bulldozers, and other machines either solo or alongside up to three other players while coordinating with voice chat. Progression is shared and the game also supports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a>.</p><p>There are eight different maps to reshape to your whims, included forested areas and deserts. Players can fully develop these locations or take a more minimal approach with the rebuild. It's entirely up to you, once the game is in your hands.</p><p>RoadCraft is currently on sale at Fanatical for $35.59, 11% off its regular price of $40. It's also available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. </p><p><em><i>Disclosure: Fanatical and GameSpot are both owned by Fandom</i>.</em></p>

                <p>According to leakers and data miners, code for double jumping and wall-running has been added to Call of Duty with the latest update, but it remains unclear if this will be used for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> or Call of Duty 2025, if used at all.</p><p dir="ltr">Several reliable Call of Duty accounts on X: <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1924770383665745976" rel="nofollow ">CharlieIntel</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thebluefoxvn/status/1924328399679697079" rel="nofollow ">AndrewVN</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1924347527991541904" rel="nofollow ">COD Warfare</a>, all shared a look at the code in the new update, as well as video of it in action. It's important to note that the double jump and wall-running are not live in the actual game but instead are being demonstrated by someone who activated the code that was added. The movement looks similar to the movement in Black Ops 3, which originally introduced the controversial wall-running mechanic. It's been confirmed that a Black Ops 3 map, Fringe, is being remade for Black Ops 6 as part of Season 4. The map may not work without wall-running or significant changes, providing a possible reason for these being added.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what exactly this is being planned for, if it's going to be used at all, is unclear. It could be leftover code; it could be for a special mode in Black Ops 6 or used in this year's Call of Duty. While unannounced, it is rumored that Call of Duty 2025 is Black Ops 7 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-will-be-black-ops-2-sequel-report/1100-6520054/">sequel to Black Ops 2</a>. Black Ops 2 had a near future sci-fi setting, but with the sequel coming out the same year the game was set, it would likely get bumped to a farther out date. It would make sense that the futuristic Call of Duty game brought back the futuristic mechanics of wall-running and double jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">The code was found as part of the most recent update to Call of Duty, which prepares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Warzone and Black Ops 6 for Season 4</a>, set to release on May 29.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone are set to expand in a big way this week with the arrival of Season 4. In this post, we're running through everything that's announced and rumored so far, including new weapons, more maps, a possible wall-running feature, and more. The full blog post covering everything that's new in Season 4 will be released on May 21, but for now, here's everything we know.</p><h2 id="Season_4_release_date"><strong>Season 4 release date</strong></h2><p>Season 4 for Black Ops 6 and Warzone will launch on May 29.</p><h2 id="Season_4_story_trailer">Season 4 story trailer</h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season continues the ongoing narrative, and that's no different for Season 4. In the new season, players can expect the return of a popular character--<a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Vikhor_%22Stitch%22_Kuzmin" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stitch</a>.</p><p>"After a daring black site breakout staged by Adler, he strikes a deal with the devil. Crack the codes and unmask the Pantheon moles in Season 04 of Black Ops 6," reads a line from the description.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g-pQLuCHsk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6g-pQLuCHsk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="New_maps">New maps</h2><p>The <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Fringe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fringe map</a> from Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 is coming to Black Ops 6's multiplayer in Season 4. It's expected to be just one of at least a few new maps, as Activision normally releases multiple new maps with each new season.</p><h2 id="New_operator"><strong>New operator</strong></h2><p>As the new cinematic alludes to, Season 4 is adding Stitch as a playable character, and he looks quite menacing. Also coming in Season 4 are a group of new skins for Adler. There could be more operators and more skins, and we'll find out soon when Activision releases all the new details for Season 4.</p><h2 id="Battle_pass"><strong>Battle pass</strong></h2><p>Of course, Season 4 will introduce a new battle pass. And while it hasn't been revealed yet, completing it will yield a rad new skin for Stitch that you can see below.</p><h2 id="New_weapons"><strong>New weapons</strong></h2><p>Each new Call of Duty season typically adds more weapons for everyone, and that seems to be the case for Season 4. Detonated reports that the LC10 and FFAR from Black Ops Cold War are coming to Black Ops 6, while the Essex Model 07 from Black Ops 4 is reportedly on the way as well. A pickaxe melee item is coming as well, it appears.</p><h2 id="Double_jump_and_wall_running_"><strong>Double-jump and wall-running?</strong></h2><p>Are we getting wall-running in Call of Duty before GTA 6? It seems like it's possible, as people have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-most-recent-black-ops-6-update-contains-double-jump-and-wall-running-code-but-its-not-being-used-yet/1100-6531692/" data-ref-id="1100-6531692">discovered a double-jump command in the game's code</a>, while players can also seemingly run on walls. It's possible this is leftover code and isn't representative of anything coming to Black Ops 6 or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-leak-suggests-a-black-ops-2-sequel-and-tranzit-return/1100-6530848/" data-ref-id="1100-6530848">new Call of Duty later this year.</a> But people are theorizing that Activision might add a limited-time mode in Season 4 that tests the waters for double-jumps and wall-running.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><p dir="ltr">A double jump type moment has been found in Black Ops 6 files after recent update. It’s not clear yet if this will actually be used in Call of Duty 2025 or leftover code. <a href="https://t.co/5kxBoTnNA0" rel="nofollow  ">pic.twitter.com/5kxBoTnNA0</a></p>  — CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1924770383665745976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><h2 id="More_Warzone_and_Zombies_content"><strong>More Warzone and Zombies content</strong></h2><p>Season 4 should add more content for the battle royale game Warzone and the Zombies mode, too, but we're still waiting to find out what that may be.

                <p>Game preservation has grown tremendously over the last couple of years, and gaming culture brand Lost in Cult is also adding to these initiatives with a brand-new line of physical games. Aiming to do things differently, Lost in Cult is kickstarting its preservation effort with three games that will "redefine" what a physical release can be.</p><p>What's immediately noticeable here is that each of the games--Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, and Thank Goodness You're Here--are being presented with original artwork, and they'll come packaged with a variant game cover, an essay booklet, poster, and more. More importantly, each game is up-to-date with its latest version and they're all playable offline. As for the price, these are listed for roughly $80 each on the UK-based site.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826"></a><figcaption>Lost In Cult physical editions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497827,1300-4497828,1300-4497829" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"></figure><p>Lost in Cult added that preservation specialists Does It Play have assisted in testing the games, and each disc or cartridge features the game in its entirety at the point of release. That means no updates, no downloads, and no codes in the box.</p><p>These will be very limited releases and they'll start shipping in Q4 2025. Immortality is limited to 1,500 copies on PS5, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is limited to 3,000 copies on PS5, and Thank Goodness You're Here will be limited to 1,500 copies on PS5 and 3,000 copies on Switch. Fans of physical games can expect a tri-monthly release cadence of games for PS5 and Switch, starting in July.</p><p>This is a noticeably different approach to physical game releases for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 console</a>, as many publishers and developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-nintendo-switch-2-titles-have-the-full-game-on-the-game-card/2900-6508/">are opting to release their titles as Game Cards</a>. This new format <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/">treats the Switch cartridge as an authentication key</a>, as Switch 2 owners will need to connect online to download the full game to their system. It is worth noting that these <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/">cartridges aren't locked to a user profile</a> or Switch 2 console, so they can be resold at a later date.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/publisher-promises-its-switch-2-game-carts-will-have-full-games-on-them/1100-6531469/">Limited Run Games also announced its own line of physical Switch games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dino-crisis-bundle-now-available-on-gog-with-enhancements/1100-6529092/">GOG began a digital games preservation program last year</a> that saw classic titles like Dino Crisis and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-years-later-this-cult-classic-capcom-jrpg-has-been-modernized-for-pc/1100-6531133/">Breath of Fire 4</a> updated for modern PC systems.</p>
