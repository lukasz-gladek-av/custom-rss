                <p>Adult games--and games with adult themes--have been delisted from digital game sales portals Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> recently, following pressure from companies that process those platforms' payments to remove them. After an extended period of silence on the matter, Mastercard has released a statement and says that its recent actions are based on the "rule of law" and aren't an attempt to enforce censorship.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's worth noting that there has been no evidence that the games removed from Steam and Itch.io included illegal content, and for an even deeper breakdown, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/steam-itch-takedowns-credit-cards-1.7597563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC have detailed timelines</a> on the entire situation so far. Visa also put out a pre-written response to complaints (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" rel="nofollow ">Polygon</a>), adding that it didn't aim to "make moral judgments on legal purchases" and that it was also adhering to the letter of the law.</p><p>The pressure from payment processors was apparently the result of a campaign by the Australian anti-porn lobbying group Collective Shout, which has taken credit for the actions. Collective Shout released an open letter claiming that Steam and indie games storefront <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> hosted games with "rape, incest and child sexual abuse" content.</p><p>It has also released statements claiming to have sent about 1,000 emails and calls to payment processors, urging them to threaten to pull support from those portals unless those games were removed. But the result has been the delisting of any game with vaguely defined adult content. Developers say that games with LGBTQ themes or content have been caught in the purge, and many have criticized the payment processors for arbitrarily enforcing their moral standards--and Collective Shout's--on what adults are allowed to buy and play.</p><p>In the weeks since payment processors have stopped supporting payments for adult content, several sites have been forced to take drastic measures. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam began purging content</a> from its storefront--and it made a vague update to its terms of service--while Itch.io <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-is-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-following-ban-on-adult-games/1100-6533545/">also began to de-index content from the site</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the site began to "re-index" adult and not safe for work content, adding that it is still in ongoing discussions with payment processors. Itch.io has long used Stripe as its payment processor, but the financial site will no longer support the sale of adult content that fits the description of â€œcontent designed for sexual gratification" on Itch.io.</p><p>The last couple of weeks have seen massive pushback against payment companies, as game organizations, developers, and artists have rallied together. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">has called for "greater transparency and fairness"</a> in the moderation of adult games, while other groups have urged people to put pressure on the two payment processors and flood them with calls to register their concerns about censorship.</p>

Miele said EA tried to "not get distracted by what was happening around us," but at the same time, the company did purposefully plan to avoid other major releases.</p>

<p>"We always said that with all of this investment and with all the potential of this franchise, we would not have put it in harm's way, and we would not have put it out in the blast radius of something really large," she said. "We were pretty unblinking, and we weren't allowing ourselves to play the, 'What if?' game with the schedules and development. We were like, 'No, we have to get this done,' because the opportunity is so big and the potential is so significant for the company."</p><p>GTA 6 was originally scheduled to release in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed the game to May 2026. After the GTA 6 delay, EA management said the launch window for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">"clearer than before."</a></p><p>As for Black Ops 7, Activision has not announced a release date yet, but a report said the game will launch on November 14, which would give Battlefield 6 about a month's space.</p><p>Timing is important for game releases, and some have theorized that another EA game, Titanfall 2, launching sandwiched between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare back in 2016 negatively impacted that game's sales. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/amrf7h/jason_schreier_on_the_tf2_release_date_mishap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more to the story</a>, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10. An<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515"> open beta</a> kicks off very soon, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is coming later. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">As the calendar transitions from summer to fall, one thing is on the mind of every sports game fan: the release of a new EA Sports FC. EA Sports FC 26 is set to release in a couple of months, and it's going to introduce a slew of new gameplay mechanics and features, while returning with all of the game modes that fans know and love. We've already seen a solid chunk of what the game is going to offer, but there could still be some surprises from EA over the next two months.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a lot to know about the next entry into EA's soccer franchise, so we're going to take a deep dive into everything we currently know about EA Sports FC 26. Here's what to expect when the game launches later this year.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_EA_Sports_FC_26_be_released_">When will EA Sports FC 26 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">EA has confirmed the release date of EA Sports FC 26 is Sept. 26. This is almost one year to the day of when EA Sports FC 25 was released, which came out on Sept. 27, 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">However, if you can't wait that long to play EA Sports FC 26, you can gain up to seven days of early access and start playing on Sept. 19--but only if you pre-order a specific edition of the game. The early access period features the full game, and you'll keep all of your progression during this period after EA Sports FC 26 has been released worldwide. So if you wanted to get a head start in Ultimate Team, for example, the seven days of early access is a huge boon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_preorder_EA_Sports_FC_26">How to preorder EA Sports FC 26</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two editions of EA Sports FC 26 you can preorder: the Standard and Ultimate Edition. Preordering either edition will net you some exclusive bonuses that aim to give you a head start across a variety of game modes. However, preordering the Ultimate Edition is how you gain the seven days of early access that begins on Sept. 19.</p><p dir="ltr">You can see the prices and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-fc-26-preorder-guide/1100-6533269/">preorder bonuses for the Standard and Ultimate Editions of EA Sports FC 26 in GameSpot's preorder guide.</a></p><p dir="ltr">You can preorder either one of these editions of EA Sports FC 26 on your system's marketplace (PS Store, Microsoft Store, Nintendo Store, Steam, EA App). Alternatively, you can visit the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/buy" rel="nofollow ">official EA FC 26 section of EA's website</a> and preorder using your system account through there.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Watch_the_EA_Sports_FC_26_trailer_here">Watch the EA Sports FC 26 trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">If you want to see some actual gameplay of EA FC 26, then you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">official reveal trailer</a> below.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSi0iJYSQ24&amp;pp=0gcJCfwAo7VqN5tD</a></p><p dir="ltr">The trailer was received generally well by fans, with many calling it the best reveal trailer for the franchise in years. However, there was a consensus that EA needs to focus on Career Mode with the new game.</p><p dir="ltr">EA went a little deeper into the gameplay side of EA Sports FC 26 with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GE8YCIQF2M">Gameplay Deep Dive trailer</a>, which you can watch if you want some more detailed explanations of the changes the game is introducing and how they play out in real time.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_platforms">EA Sports FC 26 platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for fans across the video game community, EA Sports FC 26 will be available on every major platform when it releases in September. This includes PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch, and Switch 2. EA has decided to make the game available on both Switch consoles, an interesting move considering it isn't doing the same for Madden 26, which is only coming to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">If you decide to play EA Sports 26 FC on PC, you have the choice of playing on either Steam or via the EA App for Windows. Neither platform has an edge over the other, so pick the one you feel most comfortable with.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="EA_Sports_FC_26_gameplay">EA Sports FC 26 gameplay</h2><p dir="ltr">EA Sports FC 26 will offer the core content that the franchise has become known for over the years. You'll be able to play Player and Manage Career, Ultimate Team, Clubs, and Live Events, as well as basic Quick Play matches.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to gameplay, EA is making some stark changes to how you play EA Sports FC 26. For starters, there are now two separate gameplay presets: Competitive and Authentic. These presets determine the difficulty level at which you'll be playing, and each is designed for a specific area of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Competitive preset features increased responsiveness and player control with an added emphasis on smarter passing, more intuitive rebounds, and so on. This preset is designed for online game modes, such as Ultimate Team and Clubs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053" data-ratio="0.55620316402998" data-width="1201" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4542053"></a><figcaption>EA Sports FC 26 is coming soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4542053-screenshot2025-08-01at8.53.44am.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the other hand, the Authentic preset is designed for offline game modes, like Career. You'll find added realism in this preset, making opponents more difficult to play against, and bringing a higher match speed to coincide with how players actually manage the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">Between these two new gameplay presets, you can also take advantage of freshly tuned gameplay fundamentals. EA has taken community feedback and made sweeping changes across a variety of mechanics to make them feel smoother and more responsive. You'll experience better dribbling, more intuitive AI player positioning, and improved animations, among a flurry of other changes. You can read about all of the mechanics EA has changed in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-26/news/pitch-notes-fc26-gameplay-deep-dive#gameplay-fundamentals" rel="nofollow ">dedicated blog post</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, EA has also updated goalkeepers in an attempt to make them more fluid and realistic. Goalkeepers have been given new animations and optimized with machine learning to improve their stances and attack readiness. They also have new deflection control mechanics, so you should see balls go where they're supposed to after a goalkeeper makes a nice save.</p>

                <p>In 2018, Facepunch Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rust/" data-ref-id="5000-222021">Rust</a> forced players to decide just how far they were willing to go to ensure the survival of their characters in a harsh environment. In this game, players can prey on each other for critical supplies. And now, the franchise is heading to a new frontier with Rust Mobile, which will officially debut at Gamescom 2025 from August 20-24 for the title's first hands-on experience. An announcement trailer for Rust Mobile has also been released, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8O_L8APT51Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8O_L8APT51Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Level Infinite developed Rust Mobile, which adds a few new touches to its PC predecessor. Players can explore "a real-time, fully immersive world" where they have to fend off rival players as well as the hostile wildlife that is native to the area. All of the core elements of the original game remain intact, including exploration, crafting, base-raiding, and battles to the death.</p><p>The trailer hints that players may be given warnings that their bases are under attack alongside an invitation to jump back into the game to defend what's theirs. There may also be the possibility of trust between players, but there's a far greater chance of betrayal. Players ultimately get to choose how they want to survive, and if their characters will follow any moral code.</p><p>Rust Mobile doesn't currently have a release date, but interested players are encouraged to preregister at <a href="https://rustmobile.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official site</a>. Players who want to sample Rust Mobile at Gamescom will be able to pick up posters and other merch at the game's official booth.</p><p>Preorders are currently open for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-art-of-rust-releases-this-september-preorders-now-open/1100-6529967/" data-ref-id="1100-6529967">The Art of Rust</a>, which will hit bookstores in September.

<section><p>After spending around five and half hours with Silent Hill f, I'm convinced that the series is not just back--it's at its strongest</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">As I sat down for the first of many discussions with the Silent Hill f team during my trip to Konami's Tokyo headquarters, longtime series composter Akira Yamaoka mentioned there was one philosophy in particular that guided his work on the upcoming title: wabi-sabi. Though I certainly won't claim to be the best person to succinctly summarize this ideology, as I have always understood it, wabi-sabi is about finding beauty in the transient nature of life--in imperfection, impermanence, aging, and even decay. According to Yamaoka, capturing "the feeling of the passing of time" was something he strived to do with his music; based on the time I spent with the game and music I encountered I think he succeeded. But more than that, Yamaoka made me realize just why Silent Hill f was so affecting, and why I can't stop thinking about the time I spent playing it two weeks later.</p><p dir="ltr">In Silent Hill f, beauty and decay are interwoven; flowers melt flesh; clotted rot devours once-proud structures. And yet, all of this grotesquerie is gorgeous, both visually and in the sense of somber it stirs. I was moved by Silent Hill f's visuals and the sheer artistry on display. But beyond that, I was also moved by how the series' signature examination of the human mind--which in this case, honed in on the psyche of a young teenage girl being violently thrust towards womanhood--brought me back to my own adolescence; to a time I'll never again return to and was as isolating and horrifying as it was precious and fundamental. To a part of me that, in a sense, has decayed. Not every game can invoke such a response, especially in just under six hours, and yet, Silent Hill f did.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1043594283" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Despite the success of Silent Hill 2's remake last year, it's safe to say there was still some speculation as to if the series was truly "back." I'd now go so far as to say it's not only back, it's stronger than ever, and that Silent Hill f has the potential to be the best game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a bold claim made bolder by the fact that, while a few SIlent Hill games have technically taken place outside the titular Silent Hill, Silent Hill f is the first that seems to be completely removed from the foggy New England town. Instead, Silent Hill f embraces Konami's idea that Silent Hill is a state of mind. For protagonist Hinako, "Silent Hill" takes shape as a fog- and rot-coated version of her hometown, the fictional rural village of Ebisugaoka, Japan. Silent Hill f distinguishes itself in another way too, as it trades in the series' more contemporary setting for the late 1960s--a period of time which the Silent Hill f team chose because it felt like the point in time in which the "fantasy" of Japan and its technologically-focused future collided.</p><p dir="ltr">Silent Hill f's events kick off quickly, a fact I appreciated and that kept the lingering sense of dread tangible. After witnessing yet another argument between her parents, Hinako leaves home in search of someone--anyone--to keep her distracted and talk to her. Based on that and her journal entries, we can tell she is a deeply lonely character, even if she seems to have friends and an older sister she deeply admires and who looks out for her; this fact quickly endeared her to me, despite not much having happened at this point. By the time she makes her way down the fog-drenched foothills and to Ebisugaoka's winding, Kanayama-inspired alleyways, she is thrust into a nightmare scenario befitting the Silent Hill series, albeit with plenty of added friend drama, and a second, yokai-filled spirit world she is sometimes sent to. And yes, the latter is just as fascinating, dark, and beautiful as it sounds; despite loving exploring Ebisugaoka, I was always eager to return.</p><p dir="ltr">As a high school-age girl, Hinako is no weapons expert. Though she can certainly swing a metal pipe--and can even wield ceremonial daggers and a naginata when in the spirit world--its advisable to use her track and field experience to evade enemies and pick your battles. A large part of this is because Silent Hill f puts a huge emphasis on resource management, in part by bringing back weapon degradation. Though this can be a contentious choice, I thought it worked extremely well and reflected the game's overall theme of decay, be it physical or mental.</p><p dir="ltr">On the subject of degradation, and in addition to your standard health and stamina bars, Silent Hill f adds a sanity meter to the game, another contentious choice that, when handled poorly, can feel off-putting. However, I found it works well within the game. In addition to avoiding stigmatizing mental health, it also doesn't feel like just another arbitrary gauge, as it allows Hinanko to engage in a special focus ability that, when activated, better alerts her as to when she can get a critical strike on an enemy. Naturally, closely observing enemies causes her sanity to drain, and when it's empty, she loses the ability to hone in and is left to find advantageous times on her own.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to weapon degradation, a new layer of resource management is added via the way permanent upgrades work in Silent Hill f. Scattered throughout Ebisugaoka and the spirit world are shrines Hinako can pray at, which saves your progress. Once there, she can also generate faith by enshrining objects, including those used to heal. Once an object is converted into faith, she can then draw omamori, which gives her a random accessory with its own boon, or permanently upgrade one of her stats. This adds an interesting element of choice and strategy: do you hang on to your various healing items to use in battle, or convert them into faith for permanent upgrades? Granted, there are certain items that can solely be enshrined, and plenty of goods that can only be consumed, but when it comes to the rest, it's up to players to decide how to presume.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p dir="ltr">There was still some speculation as to if the series was truly 'back.' I'd now go so far as to say it's not only back, it's stronger than ever, and that Silent Hill f has the potential to be the best game in the series</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">For the most part, I enjoyed Silent Hill f's combat. It's more fluid than previous entries and I loved how weighty Hinako's swings--and fumblings--felt. It's nothing revolutionary, but I don't particularly look for top-tier action in psychological horror games. There is a slight hiccup, though, as managing resources and avoiding engaging in every fight means navigating Ebisugaoka's tight alleyways. While tight corners, dead-ends, and a close camera add satisfying tension to the game, it can definitely feel a bit frustrating and restrictive when a blood-covered mannequin is stalking you and an arguably too slowly refilling stamina bar keeps winded as you try to dodge its attacks. At a certain point, it made the fear give way to aggravation--and made me desperately long for faster stamina regeneration, even after giving myself a few upgrades.</p><p dir="ltr">All this said, the Silent Hill series is arguably better known for its solid level design and puzzles, and Silent Hill f definitely delivers on both fronts. Much like the town of Silent Hill, Ebisugaoka is beautiful, eerie, anxiety-inducing, and a delight to explore--even if it does mean facing off against gore-covered abominations. It's also deceptively large and feels a lot less linear than you might expect. In fact, there are certain houses and areas that have wholly self-contained stories that, while not mandatory to do, can impact which ending Hinako winds up getting in later playthroughs (all players are locked into the canon ending the first time they play), making exploration all the more enticing.</p><p dir="ltr">Also like previous Silent Hill games, Silent Hill f also has a number of great set pieces including vast farmlands, darkened temples, and a dilapidated middle school, the latter of which will delight anyone who loved navigating Silent Hill 2's apartments. Though the puzzles I encountered weren't too difficult to solve, they were still fun headscratchers that saw me closely examining scarecrows, deciphering locker code language designed by middle schoolers, sorting through omamori to find the right images to accompany lengthy poems, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">While on the subject of things the Silent Hill series does well, I'd be remiss not to mention Silent Hill f's music and sound design, both of which are phenomenal. Composer Yamaoka does a tremendous job weaving together tracks that sound like Silent Hill while also incorporating more traditional Japanese instrumentation, guttural singing, and a children's choir. All of this makes the overall experience far more haunting, while the 3D sound design makes it all-encompassing as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Even taken purely at surface level, Silent Hill f's is a great experience, and the story woven in its first five hours--one of a young girl navigating rot-filled alleys and teenage psychological warfare --completely pulled me in. And yet, there was both room and this compulsion to dive deeper; deeper into Hinako's headspace, and what it meant to be a woman coming of age in 1960s Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">It was a subject I was a bit shocked to see so blatantly explored in Silent Hill f, especially considering the current climate. Although horror as a genre is actually phenomenal at facilitating conversations about adolescence and womanhood--and I'd argue that the Silent Hill series itself has done this subtly but extremely well in the past--this isn't a topic often approached in video games. During my interview with the Silent Hill f team, I asked them if it was their intention to explore gender roles, relationship dynamics between men and women, and the "horrors" of being a teenage girl. Ryukishi07 then told me that not only was it intentional, it was a part of the game he took "a lot of effort into depicting purposefully," and it shows.</p><p dir="ltr">"Since the protagonist is a girl, I believed that it was important to explore the things that would be most intimate and personal to her. From her perspective, it was important relationships--to her family and the ones that she has with her friends," Ryukishi07 said. "The relationship she has with her family is probably the most intimate and visceral, in a way. So I believe these are parts that I took a lot of effort into depicting purposely."</p><p dir="ltr">Though how things unfold exactly remains to be seen, so far I am incredibly impressed by the confidence, subtlety, and acuteness with which Konami is exploring a young girl's psyche and how isolating becoming a woman can be. Be it jabs thrown at Hinako regarding how "manly" she speaks, the subtle ways one of her "friends" undermines her femininity in front of one of their male friends, the strain that now exists between her and her aforementioned male friend as attraction becomes a concern, the shallow magazines with articles claiming "a woman is only complete once she is loved," or, most compellingly, the many journal entries Hinako pens that explain how marriage has ruined her older sister and how her mother and father's abusive dynamic has affected her, Silent Hill f is unabashed in its efforts to bring players into Hinako's mind.</p><p dir="ltr">And yet, I think there is one other exciting vessel for exploring Hinako's inner-workings that needs to be touched on: a new, unnamed character that I can already tell is going to be <em>extremely</em> popular in the Silent Hill fandom, the fox-masked man. Though I can't speak too in depth about his character yet, suffice it to say that those who were *ahem* <em>awakened </em>by Spirited Away's Haku or Labyrinth's Jareth are going to love the white haired demon and his k-pop idol good looks--even if there is something vaguely threatening about him. After encountering him a few times throughout the game, my face nearly blushing as I watched him coax Hinako with kind words and lead her through the dark spirit world he seems to inhabit, I decided I needed to ask the Silent Hill f team is they intended to create a character that fans were going to obsess over.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yes, that's the initial answer," director Al Yang laughed. "There will definitely be people who like him. In the company, I know half of the people are like, 'Oh, this guy's a dream boat.' And the other half is like, 'I don't trust this dude.' It's very both ways, but that's good. For us, that's the kind of interpretation we want--especially as we progress deeper in the story."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542105" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542105"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542105-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542106-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542107-ss_60a9221ab0c30b57921644c0e0419d65e7909755.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542108-ss_93e420a6665b42229735a3495b86bd35b7cb8c53.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542109-ss_212938a6419ccb6f2d2b6bdfe9c09a2600b7d846.1920x1080%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542110-ss_596675f3269d51ef397a7db04a08199fe1987ff1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542111-ss_c2a0f8efcb4cc01d3046a5c68675f9c811ee90e4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542112-ss_c044355340e36cfbfa67b7e386b71318a1ff75f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542113-ss_fdfc1171e15f271eb16750cd0e5575e5e312a6af.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542106,1300-4542107,1300-4542108,1300-4542109,1300-4542110,1300-4542111,1300-4542112,1300-4542113" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542106-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542107-ss_60a9221ab0c30b57921644c0e0419d65e7909755.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542108-ss_93e420a6665b42229735a3495b86bd35b7cb8c53.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542109-ss_212938a6419ccb6f2d2b6bdfe9c09a2600b7d846.1920x1080%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542110-ss_596675f3269d51ef397a7db04a08199fe1987ff1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542111-ss_c2a0f8efcb4cc01d3046a5c68675f9c811ee90e4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542112-ss_c044355340e36cfbfa67b7e386b71318a1ff75f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4542113-ss_fdfc1171e15f271eb16750cd0e5575e5e312a6af.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542106-ss_0052fc9d54c4b4f1588b798a6638556c6b5d4db2.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542107-ss_60a9221ab0c30b57921644c0e0419d65e7909755.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542108-ss_93e420a6665b42229735a3495b86bd35b7cb8c53.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542109-ss_212938a6419ccb6f2d2b6bdfe9c09a2600b7d846.1920x1080%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542110-ss_596675f3269d51ef397a7db04a08199fe1987ff1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542111-ss_c2a0f8efcb4cc01d3046a5c68675f9c811ee90e4.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542112-ss_c044355340e36cfbfa67b7e386b71318a1ff75f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4542113-ss_fdfc1171e15f271eb16750cd0e5575e5e312a6af.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The masked man--and the nature of this new "Silent Hill" that Hinako finds herself in--are not the only mysteries to solve in Silent Hill f. Since the game was announced, many have speculated as to what that little red "f" in the game's title could mean. Though many have been quick to assume that--based on its curvature--it stands for forte, the Silent Hill team has been coy when it comes to revealing what it actually stands for. In fact, based on their comments and the fact that the game has five different endings (yes, including a UFO one), it seems as though it could stand for a number of things, with different players having different interpretations.</p><p dir="ltr">"We do have a lot of different meanings infused into the letter F. But that's something that we would like to leave as an open-ended question for the players to explore and come to their own conclusions," series producer Motoi Okamoto said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, we won't have to wait too much longer to get to work on answering these questions and discovering just what that "f" might mean. Silent Hill f launches on September 25, 2025, and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
