Once we get our hands on the Pro 3, we'll update this article with our experience. At the moment, the Pro 2 is our top pick for Switch players who prefer this control layout. Similarly, this is how we felt about the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BZ3HX62N,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFGZL87S,B0DFH12YYX&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate Controller</a> before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-ultimate-2-nintendo-switch-2-controller-amazon-prime-day-gaming-deal/1100-6529695/" data-ref-id="1100-6529695">testing the Ultimate 2 series</a>, which offers a markedly improved experience. In short, the Pro 3 should probably be on your radar.</p><hr><p>The 8BitDo Pro 3 costs $20 more than the Pro 2, but the $70 price point aligns with the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth, the manufacturer's flagship controller that supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections. The Pro 2, meanwhile, only supported Bluetooth wireless and didn't come with a charging dock. The new version is the first non-Ultimate controller with a charging dock. A 2.4GHz USB-C dongle is stored in the bottom of the dock. The Pro series has always felt like the alternative flagship option for those who favor PlayStation over Xbox control layouts, and the Pro 3's specs solidify that.</p><p>Like the Ultimate 2, the Pro 3 can be viewed as an alternative to the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-SwitchTM-2-Pro-Controller-Switch/dp/B0F3VTFD6J?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</a></strong>. Nintendo's official controller feels great and even has a pair of back buttons, but there's no denying that 8BitDo's pair of premium gamepads are more versatile thanks to its suite of physical modifications and programmable customization options.</p><p>The TMR sticks on the Ultimate 2 are awesome, so it's exciting to see the tech added to the Pro series. 8BitDo's TMR sticks are noticeably smoother, more accurate, consume less power, and are said to be even more durable than the Hall Effect sticks found on the Pro 2, Ultimate, and other older controllers in the collection. Like Hall Effect, TMR sticks use magnetic sensors to register movements; this naturally reduces wear and prevents stick-drift issues from arising over time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532338"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 has magnetic ABXY buttons</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532338-pro3bluetoothgamepad-13.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the TMR sticks, the Pro 3 mirrors the Ultimate 2's remappable buttons and trigger adjustments. It has two remappable back buttons and two extra shoulder buttons that are activated by microswitches. If you flip the switches on the back, the Hall Effect triggers become non-linear microswitch triggers. The latter shortens the pull distance, effectively turning the triggers into speedy buttons.</p><p>There are a couple of differences between the Pro 3 and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth. The Ultimate 2 series has rings around the sticks with adjustable RGB lighting effects. The Pro 3 has an upgraded D-pad with improved tactile feedback. Interestingly, the G Classic edition has a series of raised ridges--three in each direction--whereas the purple and gray models have the familiar directional arrows instead.</p><p>The Pro 3 also has a customization option that will be a big deal for some players: swappable face buttons. Inside the box, you'll find a small tool to remove the magnetic ABXY buttons. You can then reverse A/B and X/Y to fit your preference for Nintendo's and Microsoft's button layout. Though the Pro 3 doesn't offer Xbox console support, you can use it for Xbox Cloud Gaming as well as for games you have installed on Steam Deck, Windows, mobile devices, etc. Xbox's control layout, with Y on top and A on the bottom, is generally considered the default for any platform not made by Nintendo or PlayStation.</p><p>With the Ultimate 2 series, you need to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCWSX17,B0DRCV3SPH,B0DRCWJSKZ,B0F9P4P6HB&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">buy the 2.4GHz-only model</a> to get the Xbox layout and the Bluetooth model for Nintendo compatibility. The Ultimate series has always had a separate 2.4GHz model for PC players and a slightly more expensive model that adds Bluetooth and Switch support. There's nothing wrong with that release model, especially for those who aren't interested in Nintendo consoles. But it's cool that 8BitDo created a built-in solution for those who have issues with Nintendo's control layout on other platforms. You could even remap the buttons after switching their locations to use Xbox's layout on Switch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337" data-ratio="0.667" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532337"></a><figcaption>The ball-top stick caps match each controller's theme. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532337-pro3bluetoothgamepad-10.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4532339,1300-4532340" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532339-pro3bluetoothgamepad-9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532340-pro3bluetoothgamepad-12.jpg"></figure><p>According to 8BitDo, the ball-top stick caps were "made purely for fun," but we're looking forward to checking them out. Regardless of whether they feel practical to use, they look pretty cool on the Pro 3 and are themed around the controller's color. For instance, the retro gray NES/SNES-inspired model comes with a pair of red ball-top caps. If you opt for the GameCube-themed purple edition, you'll get yellow ball-tops.</p><p>With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 app, you can adjust stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivities, create dead zones, modify rumble intensity, and remap inputs. Up to three unique control configurations can be saved directly to the controller, and you can cycle through them on the fly by pressing the profile button.</p><hr><h2>8BitDo is having a big year</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353" data-ratio="0.35" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4532353"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Pro 3 | 8BitDo Ultimate 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4532353-8bitdopro3vsultimate2.png"></figure><p>The Pro 3 is just the latest major addition to 8BitDo's impressive accessory lineup in 2025.

                <p>Something has gone awry during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s new update, and the the mega-popular online shooter/metaverse is down. Epic has acknowledged the error with <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1945120590756495735" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on @FortniteStatus</a> that offers no indication of how long the game will remain offline.</p><p>"Hey everyone, we're extending downtime while we work to resolve an issue discovered during offline checks. We'll do our best to get Fortnite servers online ASAP. Keep an eye on this thread for any future updates."</p><p>There's unlikely to be any further explanation from Epic, but the fact that the company has publicly acknowledged a delay likely means it won't be resolved all that quickly--there's a possibility it will remain offline into the evening. If a fix was coming within an hour or two, Epic would almost certainly have just hunkered down and finished it instead of posting about it. While we have no official explanation for the delay, one datamining group <a href="https://x.com/osirion_gg/status/1945090149949272330" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has suggested</a> it's because the new patch doesn't account for a server-side hotfix that was deployed last week.</p><p>It's not the most opportune moment for this to happen, since this patch is Fortnite's first update in a month, and is intended to introduce Superman's Fortress of Solitude to the Battle Royale island, along with all sorts of other goodies like <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1945074480662892874" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Fantastic Four skins</a> that will likely be sold alongside the new movie later this month. It's another delay for Superman-related content, after the arrival of the new David Corenswet Superman skin on the battle pass was marred by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-superman-cosmetics-are-bugged/1100-6533120/" data-ref-id="1100-6533120">a bug</a> that prevented most folks from being able to unlock it.</p>

                <p>Like most open-world games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> will have its fair share of collectibles to hunt down. The catch here is that you'll need to really work to get your hands on collectible bobblehead replicas of everyone's refund-adverse arms dealer, Marcus, as these will be hidden away in hard-to-reach areas.</p><p>As detailed by Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, the idea for these collectibles came from the studio wanting to push the game's enhanced move-set to its very limits. Borderlands 4 has several new traversal options--including gliding, double-jumping, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/" data-ref-id="1100-6528427">and using a grapple-hook to move around areas</a>--and Gearbox wanted to reward players with a memento for reaching remote spots on the map.</p><p>"Graeme Timmons--Borderlands 4's creative director--got with some of our designers and other artists and engineers and decided that we needed something for players to find when they made their way to these remote or uninhabited areas," <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944529531978858850" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford tweeted</a>. "We wanted something of an icon. The same kind of thing in each spot, so players would <em>know</em> they found it. The item had to be simple, recognizable, have a feeling of being something one might collect--and ideally--having real connections to our universe."</p><p>This led to the Marcus bobblehead being chosen, and there's even an in-universe reason for these being on the isolationist planet of Kairos. As Pitchford noted, there are "well over 200" of these bobbleheads to collect, and he expects that most players will never see any of them. "A very, very small number of people will explore Kairos so completely that they might discover them all. Each has a story," Pitchford added, while also throwing down a gauntlet to players with the inclusion of a map showing off the locations of these collectibles.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1944532238554812905" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">All in all, there are well over 200 Marcus Bobbleheads hidden around Kairos.
