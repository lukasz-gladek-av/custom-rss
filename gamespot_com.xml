                <p>After a fairly short spring season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is trying something new with battle royale: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnites-star-wars-season-galactic-battle/2900-6518/" data-ref-id="2900-6518">a shortened, five-week season that's all about Star Wars</a>. Unfortunately for us, there's just one little thing getting in the way of us diving into all the new stuff: Fortnite servers are down for maintenance while Epic deploys the new season update. Below, you'll find a rundown on when Fortnite servers should be back online.</p><p>Despite the short length, Season 2 has been pretty eventful, introducing the amazing new Kneecapper and Rocket Drill items, and also adding Sabrina Carpenter as the latest Festival headliner just a few weeks ago. But now Season 2 is done, and the Kneecapper is a thing of the past--but you still can't play just yet. There are many fun activities you can try while you wait, like going outside or sleeping, but that's not what we're here to talk about right now. Let's go ahead and cut to the chase.</p><h2>Fortnite's Star Wars Season start time</h2><p>When Fortnite goes offline to deploy a patch, it usually takes about three or four hours, but a new season launch is much more of a thing than your average update is. For a new season, Fortnite typically goes offline for four hours at minimum, and often longer. Sometimes <em>much </em>longer--Fortnite was offline for 18 hours ahead of the start of Chapter 5 Season 2 last year. If all goes well, you can expect Fortnite to come back online, at the earliest, around 3 AM PT/6 AM ET.</p><p>When Fortnite's servers do return to action, the Star Wars takeover will begin immediately in both battle royale and Lego Fortnite. There will be a new battle pass full of Star Wars skins, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-may-the-4th-brings-star-wars-pass-for-lego-fortnite-and-new-skins-instruments-cars/2900-5337/" data-ref-id="2900-5337">new Lego Pass full of Star Wars</a> builds and a Captain Phasma skin, and very likely some new stuff in the shop as well. For those who don't observe May the 4th, other Epic-made modes like Reload and OG will continue doing their own thing, without any injections of Star Wars content aside from skins that other players are wearing.</p><p>Epic started the hype train much earlier than it normally does for a new season of Fortnite, revealing the Galactic Battle season two weeks ahead of launch at Star Wars Celebration in Japan. Epic typically doesn't reveal a new season until the week of launch. So while you're waiting for downtime to end, you can read up on what to expect in the new season, from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-season/2900-6519/" data-ref-id="2900-6519">map changes</a>, to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6520/" data-ref-id="2900-6520">new weapons</a>, to the battle pass lineup, and everything else we already know.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has surpassed 2 million players, Ubisoft said in a brief announcement. The news comes roughly 15 months after The Lost Crown's release in January 2024, and Ubisoft appears to be teasing a bright future for the series. </p><p dir="ltr">"Well over 2M players by now," Ubisoft said on the Prince of Persia's official X account." You’ve revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us--he's just warming up."</p><p dir="ltr">What Ubisoft has in store for The Prince of Persia is anyone's guess, though. The company disbanded The Lost Crown's development team in October 2024 on account of lower-than-forecasted sales, though those who worked on the game were shuffled around to different parts of Ubisoft and not laid off. It's worth noting that 2 million players isn't the same as 2 million sales. The Lost Crown was available on Ubisoft+, Ubisoft's subscription service, and has also been part of the PS Plus Extra and Premium. </p><p dir="ltr">The Lost Crown released to widespread praise from critics, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/">GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>, who called it "so confident and impeccably crafted that this should simply be the identity of Prince of Persia for the foreseeable future." Ubisoft reportedly rejected Ideas for a Lost Crown sequel prior to breaking up the development team, though the company never confirmed whether that was true.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake remains in development, apparently on track for release sometime in 2026. Ubisoft first announced the project in 2020, though it was delayed several times, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">"indefinite delay" in 2021</a>, and restarted development completely in 2023. It re-entered full production in June 2024, though Ubisoft has said nothing about the project since.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has revealed the roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">Overwatch 2 Stadium</a>, just a few weeks after the new mode's launch. The roadmap includes information about heroes being added to the Stadium roster, new maps and modes within Stadium, and some stats from players' time with the mode already.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest damage hero Freja will be added to Stadium's limited roster as part of the midseason update for the current season, which Blizzard said is expected to launch on May 20. That will be followed by Season 17 in June, which will see the addition of Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta to the roster. The Stadium roster started with only 17 heroes, as the new mode feature items and powers that you can use to make a build in the mode. These require additional balancing, so Blizzard is slowly adding the full Overwatch roster to the mode. That update will also include two more maps, Esperanca and Samoa, along with the ability to save custom builds and share them. Season 17 will also include cross-play, which hasn't been available in the mode since console and PC players don't share competitive lobbies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083"></a><figcaption>Freja will be the next hero to join the Stadium roster.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 18 kicks off in August with Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte joining the roster, along with a new game mode, Payload Race. Payload Race will come with two Payload maps, Route 66 and London, although Blizzard didn't share any details on how the mode will differ from regular payload matches. The roadmap stops at Season 19, simply stating that more maps and heroes will continue to be added to the mode, along with new items.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also shared that Stadium is currently the most popular mode in Overwatch 2, "eclipsing" Quick Play and Competitive, the two main modes. The mode saw 2.3 million matches played in 7.8 million hours, which is more than twice the amount Overwatch Classic saw when it launched, the previous most popular new mode. Blizzard also shared that Lucio is both the hero with the highest win percentage and the lowest pick rate.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Microsoft just joined Nintendo in announcing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some of its games will sell for $80</a>, and this new rate will seemingly apply to both physical <em>and </em>digital games. The price hike is inspiring a lot of debate and discussion, with some wondering why the price of digital games is going up. Many might be able to understand why a disc-based product might go up in price due to tariffs and other market factors, but why would digital games get more expensive, too?</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1917978011661713905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's true there is no "direct" tariff impact on digital games, but publishers may choose to raise prices anyway for a variety of reasons. To begin with, raising the price of a digital product could help offset rising costs in other departments, he said. Second, a publisher might raise the price of a digital game to bring it in line with its physical counterpart.</p><p>Other factors could be that a game's price is going up to reflect the increased cost to develop a particular game, along with a belief that people will, in general, accept the price increase. Lastly, a publisher might decide to charge more for a digital game "because they can," Ahmad said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo announced that it would sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> would sell for $80, for both its physical and digital edition. Not every Nintendo game will carry the heftier price tag, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a> is priced at $70.</p><p>Microsoft announced on May 1 that it is raising the price of some games to $80 later this year, with price hikes on consoles going into effect immediately, making one version of the Xbox Series X more expensive than the PS5 Pro. Microsoft hasn't published a list of its $80 games yet, but the company did say <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> is not getting a price hike, too, at least not yet.</p><p>Now, many are wondering if Sony will follow suit with an announcement of increased costs for its consoles and games.</p><p>New AAA video games sold for $60 for years before Take-Two was among the first to raise prices to $70 in 2020. The company said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-coming-take-two-sees-no-pushback-on-70-games/1100-6514323/" data-ref-id="1100-6514323">"no pushback" at the time over the higher price</a>, and $70 later became the standard for Take-Two and others. According to one analyst, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">hope in the video game industry that Take-Two will charge $100 for GTA 6</a> to help reinvigorate the video game industry. As of yet, however, Take-Two has not announced pricing plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>.</p><p>For comparison, GTA 5 launched at $60 back in 2013. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about $82 in 2025.</p><p>Outside market conditions and development costs, Microsoft is staying rather vague about suddenly raising the prices for so many Xbox products. It's possibly related to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">new Trump administration tariffs in the US, because they led to Switch 2 preorder delays</a> and eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/-/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">some price hikes.</a> </p><p>Microsoft, for its part, is raising prices <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the company overall generates huge amounts of money</a>. For the past three months alone, Microsoft brought in $70 billion in revenue and made a profit of $25.8 billion.</p>

While new main story campaign quests are expected, the patch has more than a few surprises in store, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of them is a new way to level characters that sounds like a more story-driven version of Chromie Time. By speaking to Lorewalker Cho in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, or Dornogal starting in patch 11.1.7, players can complete three repeatable quest chains containing both old and new quests from previous expansions but that share a common story thread. One quest chain, for example, dives into the history of iconic Warcraft villain Arthas, where players will be able to battle through Strathholme during the culling before jumping to the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion and stepping into the shoes of Arthas himself. Another questline dives into the history of current main villain Xal'atath, as players experience her origins in Legion, how she regained her physical form in Battle for Azeroth, and a past confrontation between her and the Old Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate much on the new Lorewalker Cho quests, but it seems a great way to keep new or returning players up to date on plot threads that are currently relevant, with Xal'atath's origins, and another quest chain involving the Ethereals, being perfect examples. Why Arthas and the Lich King are featured prominently with a questline despite having no real connection to The War Within's events is anyone's guess. Perhaps the Lich King still has some role to play, or more likely Blizzard simply knows Arthas is one of the game's most enduring characters. Presumably, max-level characters can also experience these quest chains for a lore refresher, though what rewards they might contain is currently unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">Another surprise is the introduction of Overcharged Delves, more dangerous versions of six specific Delves that will feature more traps and enemies, as well a new trait tree specific to these amped up versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">WoW's solo dungeons</a>. Blizzard will additionally be adding Battle for Azeroth dungeons to the game's Timewalking lineup as part of the return of the Turbulent Timeways event, complete with a new Battle for Azeroth Timewalking vendor.</p><p dir="ltr">While it will be coming sometime after the patch's launch, Blizzard also detailed the return of its Diablo-themed Greedy Emissary event that sees players hunting down Treasure Goblins for rare loot.
