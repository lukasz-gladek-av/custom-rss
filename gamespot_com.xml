                <p>The Pokemon Company and McDonald's have teamed up before, but not without <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meal-promotion-begins-is-immediately-ruined-by-adults/1100-6487354/" data-ref-id="1100-6487354">attracting undo attention from would-be scalpers</a>. Earlier this month, McDonald's Japan was forced to end its latest Pokemon Happy Meal promotion a few days early because the supply of cards quickly ran out amid chaotic crowds clamoring for the cards that came with them.</p><p>According to <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a>, scalpers drove most of the demand for Pokemon cards and many of them abandoned their Happy Meals uneaten at the restaurants or on the streets outside. In some cases, the crowds inside the McDonald's restaurants were so unruly that the police had to be called.</p><p>The most-prized item from this giveaway was a McDonald's-exclusive Pikachu card featuring Pokemon's iconic creature ready to scarf a Happy Meal of his own. Aside from the scalpers who came away with the cards, the only real winners of this PR debacle were the pigeons who devoured the discarded meals.</p><p>McDonald's Japan did set a limit of five Happy Meals per customer, but that limit was either ignored or circumvented by scalpers. Overzealous collectors and scalpers aren't unique to Japan. American Rick and Morty fans may recall <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rick-and-morty-co-creator-responds-as-mcdonalds-ap/1100-6453883/" data-ref-id="1100-6453883">the Szechuan Sauce mania</a> that occurred in 2017 when McDonald's briefly brought it back.</p><p>However, Pokemon fans appear to be in a league of their own. Reports have emerged that the Japanese mob has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using some Pokemon </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">cards to launder money</a>. Last May, a UK man was arrested in possession of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-arrested-after-being-found-with-a-stolen-pokemon-card-haul-worth-over-300000/1100-6531563/" data-ref-id="1100-6531563">over $300k worth of stolen Pokemon cards</a>.</p><p>The resurgence of Pokemon fandom shows no signs of abating, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokepark-kanto-will-let-you-experience-real-world-of-pokemon-in-2026/1100-6533333/" data-ref-id="1100-6533333">there's even a PokePark Kanto attraction </a>slated to open next year in Japan. The next game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, will be released on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p>

                <p>PlayerUnknown Productions has announced that an open beta for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prologue-go-wayback/">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27" rel="nofollow ">Epic Games Store</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creators-new-rust-inspired-survival-game-is-getting-a-free-steam-beta/1100-6531371/">A Rust-inspired survival game</a>, Prologue: Go Wayback combines hardcore roguelike survival gameplay with a dynamic weather system and machine-learning models to create a unique experience for every player. The next game from PUBG creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, the open beta will run until the launch of the game's early access period on PC.</p><p>"After running playtests with our Discord community over the last six months--and receiving some fantastic feedback--we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions," PlayerUnknown Productions said in a press release. "We have a great survival experience, with millions of maps for players to explore in the open beta, and over the coming months leading up to our Early Access launch, we plan to add more features to further customize your preferred way to play."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hU9eG0-Ep8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_hU9eG0-Ep8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will have a 64km² map based on the Czech Bohemia region to explore, with the world being rendered with ML models in Unreal Engine 5 and then populated procedurally with custom assets such as trees, rivers, rocks, cliffs, hills, and shelters. PlayerUnknown Productions added that this ML model is trained on publicly available open-source data and vetted to prevent the use of any copyrighted material.</p><p>One of the other factors that sets Prologue: Go Wayback apart from other survival games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prologue-go-backs-first-trailer-pits-man-versus-dangerously-cold-weather/1100-6529755/">is an emphasis on body temperature</a>, as players will have to manage their internal heat by finding better clothes and by building fires to stay warm as they search for the fabled Weather Tower. Prologue: Go Wayback also serves as the foundation for Project Artemis, something that PlayerUnknown Productions refers to as a platform that will enable "massive-scale creation" for future projects.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Interestingly, Battlefield 2042 had the opposite problem, with players often complaining that the maps felt too big and often lifeless. In the BF6 beta, however, players are saying that the small map sizes mean they are pushed to engage far too often.</p><p>The criticism is far from universal, of course. Some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ml9u97/psa_small_maps_are_not_a_new_thing_this_is_bf3s/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stand behind</a> the smaller maps, pointing out that some fan-favorite Battlefield maps like Sienne Crossing and Grand Bazaar were also small. Other players counter that the issue with the new maps may not be their actual size, but how combat and movement flow through them.</p><p>The largest of the beta maps, Liberation Peak, suffers from a different design issue that has been annoying players--terrain that heavily favors snipers. The abundance of snipers has been parodied in memes showing an absurd number of sniper glints coming from Liberation Peak's rocky terrain--though real screenshots posted in the replies show these edits aren't really that far from the truth.</p><p>Of course the point of a beta is that elements that don't work can be changed before the game's launch, which is scheduled for October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. BF6 devs have publicly addressed some feedback, while EA also has a full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/" data-ref-id="2900-6845">list of changes</a> that will be implemented pre-launch. The developer has said it will be going over player feedback from the beta to identify what else needs to be modified before launch.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p>

                <p>In its financial results for the first half of 2025, Remedy Entertainment says that it is "unsatisfied" by the post-launch sales of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a>. While the company says that its co-op PvE game reached 1 million players after launch in June--with high numbers from PS5 and Xbox Series X|S specifically--PC sales underperformed and weren't enough to cover the low sales on console. It's worth noting that FBC: Firebreak was available day-one through PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, with those playerbases likely being responsible for the game reaching 1 million players in 10 days.</p><p>Remedy's first self-published game, FBC: Firebreak did receive a payment from Microsoft and Sony for allowing its game to be distributed via the respective subscription services of those two companies, with Remedy aiming for Steam to be "the primary consumer sales channel" on PC. FBC: Firebreak was met with negative feedback and poor post-launch sales, Remedy says, but it's still committed to turning the game around, and it says that it has a solid foundation to build on, going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy said</a>. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive--showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop. Looking ahead, a larger 'Major Update' late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak."</p><p>Remedy says that it will launch targeted marketing activities to further drive interest in the title, as well as work with the game's community to help expand it over time. One of the changes that players can expect in September is a reworked opening, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fbc-firebreak-update-will-address-the-game-frustrating-opening-hour/1100-6533265/">as Remedy plans to address the "frustrating" first hour of FBC: Firebreak</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Remedy posted positive results in Q2 2025, as it says that revenue increased by 63.5% to $19.6 million, Alan Wake 2 and Control continued to sell steadily, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beyond-alan-wake-2-every-game-remedy-is-working-on-right-now/1100-6514998/" data-ref-id="1100-6514998">and progress on Control 2</a> is on track. "The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering," Remedy said.</p><p>As for the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake project, Remedy says it remains in "full production" and development on it alongside Rockstar Games remains productive.</p>
