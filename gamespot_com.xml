                <p>With Summer Game Fest coming at the end of the week, the deluge of video game news that accompanies the annual event is set to begin soon. IO Interactive has kicked things off with the news that Project 007--the studio's new adventure starring famous spy James Bond--will officially be known as <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1929553749963350144" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">007: First Light</a>, and the game is set to be revealed later this week.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is a "wholly original Bond origin story" according to the game's official website, that will let players "step into the shoes of the world's favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status." No other new information about First Light was shared, including which platforms it will appear on--the only known platform so far is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, after a brief teaser appeared during the Switch 2 Direct in April.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505013"></a><figcaption>007: First Light teaser image</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4505013-007.jpg"></figure><p>Previously, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak mentioned that First Light will be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">the start of a new trilogy</a>" focused on James Bond, and that IO's version of Bond will not be based on any other version of the character. "What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said, "so it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future."</p><p>007: First Light was one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">many third-party games confirmed</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 during the Switch 2 Direct, along with From Software's next project The Duskbloods, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and Street Fighter 6. First-party Nintendo titles announced during the event include Donkey Kong Bananza, Mario Kart World, and Kirby Air Riders.</p><p>Summer Game Fest Live kicks off at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET on Friday, June 6. While 007: First Light has not been confirmed for the show, a <a href="https://x.com/teamcloutstudio/status/1928481528436097442" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">mysterious game called Ill</a> has been teased for the show, as well as an appearance by <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1927369805876559946" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kojima Productions head Hideo Kojima</a>.</p>

                <p>The Witcher developer CD Projekt Red has discussed what it's learned throughout decades of development, and one of the key takeaways is that the studio should focus on what it's best at instead of trying too many different things.</p><p>"We've learned that we have to be razor-sharp focused," chairman Marcin Iwinski said on the AnsweRed podcast, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-developer-cd-projekt-plans-to-stick-to-its-niche-and-thats-aaa-rpg-open-world-narrative-driven-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reported by IGN</a>. "We cannot do so many things we would love to do--we are <em>tempted</em> to do. We tried and it didn't work out. We have to focus on what we are good at, and really put 100% into it."</p><p>Joint-CEO Adam Badowski added, "We're gonna develop AAA RPG, open-world narrative-driven games and this is our, let's say, niche. So the focus is there."</p><p>Iwinski said this sounds simple, but there were temptations to try new things outside of the company's core focus. "And you think, 'OK, no, let's take a deep breath and come back to what we're doing. Because if we spread ourselves too thin, we'll not deliver," Iwinski said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sYilj_DIGc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6sYilj_DIGc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not immediately clear what Iwinski meant when he said, "We tried and it didn't work out."
