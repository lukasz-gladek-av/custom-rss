                <p>For the first time since it began running its annual small-scale Rainbow Royale event to celebrate members of the LGBTQIA+ community four years ago, Fortnite skipped its Pride celebration in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">For each year since 2021, Fortnite has held its annual Pride event, Rainbow Royale, sometime during the summer. It was never a particularly huge event, as it mainly consisted of a pile of free rainbow-colored items in the item shop, like the Take a 'Bow and The Dip emotes. In 2022, they even had a Pride-themed battle bus and a few quests that you could complete to unlock a <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8288" rel="nofollow ">cool weapon wrap</a> and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8276" rel="nofollow ">hammer pickaxe</a>, and dropped a skin for DC's Dreamer, a transgender superhero, in the item shop as part of the celebration, but that was as involved as it ever got. The annual Pride event wasn't exactly a takeover, since it never involved gameplay changes in Battle Royale. Last year the whole thing was <em>only</em> a shop section, which popped up for a week in both June and September.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579108"></a><figcaption>Fortnite used to celebrate Pride.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In 2025, though, Fortnite has skipped Rainbow Royale completely. For the first time since Epic introduced the event, Fortnite has made it to October without anything related to Rainbow Royale appearing in the game. None of the free Pride items have been available in the shop during this calendar year thus far. The Mazy skin, a paid cosmetic that is usually included in the Rainbow Royale shop section, has popped up in the item shop by itself on just one single day in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">We can't say why Epic has chosen not to hold any form of its annual pride event this year, since the company did not respond to our multiple requests for comment. That leaves us to speculate that this decision by Epic to skip Pride is the result of the new Trump administration's bigoted attempts to eliminate diversity and inclusion efforts in the United States. We have no idea whether Epic skipped its Pride events because leadership agrees with the administration's queerphobic policies, if it just wants to avoid any "controversy" that might fire up the right, or if there's some other reason entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">But we've spent this whole year thus far watching one corporation after another become more regressive in order to stay on the good side of an unhinged presidential administration, including in gaming. There was a huge dust-up earlier this year when the long-running MMO RuneScape <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/anonymous-employee-accuses-runescape-of-kowtowing-to-trump-as-it-puts-the-kibosh-on-new-pride-events-the-content-is-now-controversial-in-a-way-it-didnt-used-to-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">skipped its annual Pride event</a>, with Jagex's CEO Jon Bellamy saying that Pride is "now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously, risk that I’m personally responsible to protect against."</p><p dir="ltr">"Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be 'woke' or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect," Bellamy went on. These comments didn't do much to assuage the game's LGBTQIA+ community.</p><p dir="ltr">Since Epic hasn't made any public comment about Rainbow Royale's status, it's pretty tough to look at its disappearance and not assume the Fortnite maker is hedging its bets in the exact same way that Jagex did with RuneScape.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Games based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons aren't anything new, but it's no secret that Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> did a lot to popularize video games in which you roll dice. In the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/following-baldurs-gate-3-wotc-and-hasbro-are-investing-1-billion-in-their-aaa-game-ecosystem/1100-6522241/">Wizard of the Coast invested $1 billion into its gaming ecosystem</a>, partnering with several different developers to create their own takes on D&amp;D, such as Tactical Adventures' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-5e-is-fully-represented-in-solasta-2-for-better-and-worse/1100-6529659/"><em>very </em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition-coded Solasta II</a> and an unnamed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/">single-player D&amp;D game from Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen's new studio</a>. Unless WotC does a mass cancellation (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/">the five D&amp;D games canned</a> just prior to the release of Baldur's Gate 3), we can expect quite a few D&amp;D games over the next several years.</p><p dir="ltr">The next one is slated for this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked/" data-ref-id="5000-660554">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>, a mouthful of a title for a fun four-player co-op game. If Baldur's Gate 3 is for folks who want something on par with the mechanical crunch of D&amp;D Fifth Edition, then Battlemarked feels like the ideal choice for those who want something more approachable--a game to play with kids too young for something like Baldur's Gate 3, or other adults too busy to devote hours to a hobby as time-consuming as D&amp;D.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKLByGDB6Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SRKLByGDB6Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot got an exclusive first look at Battlemarked, playing through two early levels alongside game director Gustav Stenmark and PR director Jamie Camargo. While I played as a Tiefling Rogue, Camargo played as an Elf Ranger, and Stenmark controlled two characters: a Dragonborn Paladin and Gnome Wizard. The first level we played through was a simple encounter between the party of heroic adventurers and a band of attacking goblins, while the second was the first floor of a multi-leveled dungeon crawl.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlemarked is set in the Forgotten Realms, the same setting as Baldur's Gate 3 and the recent Honor Among Thieves movie, making Battlemarked a great way to revisit familiar locations and characters that may have grown stale over repeat playthroughs or watches. There seems to be a concerted effort to build on this setting, rather than branch off into Eberron, Krynn, or something homebrewed. I'm still hoping we get a game that goes to Eberron one day, but I did like how easy it was to familiarize myself with what's going on in Battlemarked's story, who the bad guys in a fight are, and how certain non-player characters might react to specific dialogue choices. The familiar setting feeds into Battlemarked's approachable nature, speaking "the same language" as the most popular framework through which stories in D&amp;D have been told.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133"></a><figcaption>The demo kicked off with fending off a goblin ambush.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But it's the gameplay, not the narrative details, that had me begging Stenmark and Camargo to play past my allotted preview session. In Battlemarked, most missions focus on combat. It's turn-based, with each player taking a turn before the enemy creatures then all simultaneously go. Each class has a deck of 10 cards that they bring into battle, and draw from each turn, and every player gets two Actions per turn. Each card has an Action cost ranging from 0 to two, and movement, melee attacks, and interacting with the environment each take one Action.</p><p dir="ltr">I love this structure. I've long disliked how D&amp;D's combat--which largely separates everything into an Action, Bonus Action, Free Action, and Movement--can make things difficult for new players to grasp. Why is this one spell an Action, while this other one is a Bonus Action, and this one specific feature that this one class has that's <em>like </em>magic is a Free Action? Balance, mainly. But there's no easy rule of thumb as to why some stuff is an Action and some stuff is a Bonus Action. You just have to know. That means memorization. And that takes time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134"></a><figcaption>For the second part of the demo, we went into a dungeon crawl.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lots of other tabletop systems (Pathfinder most notably) have adopted a structure like what Battlemarked has, where <em>everything </em>is just an Action, and each player has the same number of Actions per turn. This is much easier to understand, but Battlemarked maintains D&amp;D's strategic elements and teamplay by relying on cards. With 10 cards in the deck, you'll understand what your class can do fairly quickly but you only ever have about five or six cards in your hand at a time (occasionally, a player might find a potion or two in the environment, which appears as an extra card in your hand until used), so you have to plan in the moment with what cards you have and attempt to plan for what's to come based on what card you might draw on your next turn.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rogue has a card that lets them turn invisible for three turns, letting them land a more lethal melee attack from anywhere--not just a backstab. Once you attack, the invisibility ends early. This card is a great way to escape from a sticky situation, but I preferred saving it because if I drew a card called Knock Out, I could perform the Rogue's unique melee strike that stunned an enemy, leaving them open for the Paladin's devastating Smite or Wizard's explosive Fireball. Best part: Knock Out has the unique effect of not breaking invisibility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135"></a><figcaption>The maps in Battlemarked are quite detailed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A few other cards have a similar level of synergy. The Dragonborn's poison breath could coat enemies and the ground in deadly fumes that could be ignited for further damage by the Wizard's fiery spells, and the Ranger's assortment of trick arrows could bunch up enemies to leave them susceptible to the Rogue's assortment of bombs. And this was just the demo, with everyone running with an unchanging deck of 10 cards. The full game lets you unlock new abilities and customize your deck, curating the ideal playstyle for your chosen class. There's a nice level of depth to Battlemarked's combat despite how easy it is to pick up.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game I'm still unsure of is the narrative, simply because the demo I played didn't feature much of it. Like D&amp;D, your character has ability scores that provide bonuses to skills like Persuasion and Arcana, and when speaking to non-player characters, you can attempt a roll of the dice with these skills to try to glean additional information or convince others to do as you please. During the demo, Stenmark convinced a noble of our friendly nature so that he would trust us, for example, while I failed at identifying a strange mushroom and chose to just eat it (it was deeply poisonous, so lesson learned), and we both couldn't manage to convince a group of deadly myconids that we came in peace, leading to an amusing battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136"></a><figcaption>You can use enviornmental hazards to your advantage as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On first glance, there doesn't seem to be as much narrative depth in Battlemarked as what's been seen in other dice-based RPGs, like Baldur's Gate 3 or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector/" data-ref-id="5000-590957">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>. But the outcomes of the few choices our group made were rewarding each time--either because we got what we wanted, or we failed, but the outcome of failure was written to be hilarious or at least not so devastating that it demanded we restart the current encounter. It seems like the dialogue choices and more story-driven elements will provide sufficient enjoyment, but the best part of the game is clearly the card-based, D&amp;D-inspired combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is launching for PC, PS5, and Meta Quest on November 20.</p>

<p>"There were a number of learnings we had from creepy king," Yashinsky said. "And we've moved away from creepy king because he had limited appeal."</p><p>If you remember Sneak King--or the "Creepy King" mascot Burger King used from 2004 to 2011--the game put you behind The King's mask and tasked you with stealthily delivering different types of meals to hungry folks. It was one of three games known as The Burger King Games, which included the bumper car sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/big-bumpin/" data-ref-id="5000-28541">Big Bumpin'</a>, the pocketbike racer ... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pocketbike-racer/" data-ref-id="5000-28540">PocketBike Racer</a>, and Sneak King.</p><p>Sneak King was a weird licensed game that developed a somewhat cult following, with players like Redditor JR_Masterson "waiting for a Sneak King sequel" for over 18 years now. All that waiting may be for naught, though, as Burger King, according to Restaurant Business, now seeks to move passed this frightening mascot era.</p>
