                <p dir="ltr">Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has shipped and BioWare is free to pour its resources into the fifth entry in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect/">Mass Effect</a> series, players are naturally getting excited. But according to former executive producer Mark Darrah, it'll take some time for BioWare to really get the game development wheels turning.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE">newly released video documenting the production of Veilguard</a>. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/">Anthem</a> or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource. It had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GR5p4maGiRE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]," Darrah continued. "You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto [work on] Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."</p><p dir="ltr">Darrah worked for BioWare for 23 years, so although he may not be a current employee, he does likely have a pretty good idea of the studio's inner workings. At any rate, the lack of advertising for Mass Effect 5 also suggests that the game's development is still in its infancy. It was first announced in 2020, but it's been crickets from BioWare since then.</p><p dir="ltr">"This [decision to focus on one game at a time] might be great," Darrah said of BioWare's steady, focused approach to the game's development, "Because what it means is BioWare--for really the first time ever--is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all [its] attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal, which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."</p>

There aren't any customizations to be had, but one feature it does include that seems likely to return when Blizzard introduces player housing proper is a way for players to set their Hearthstone to their new home.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time WoW players have received more personal living space. During the Warlords of Draenor expansion players had an entire Garrison to call their own, while Class Order Halls offered class-specific spaces for players of the same class to hang out in. This is, however, the first instance of players being able to acquire an apartment to call home.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a couple potential clues to how WoW might implement player housing to be gleaned here. For starters, the apartment simply exists in the game world, and players when visiting are treated to their own private "instance" of it. That seems to imply player housing won't be an entirely separate zone or a specific neighborhood where players can build custom houses, but rather the homes up for grabs will be added to existing locations in the world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431922"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's first player-owned apartment (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4431922-1209629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Given how players are granted this apartment as a quest, it also seems likely that players will be given some form of player housing for free come Midnight, though there is certainly still room to have players be able to purchase other, more desirable properties. Players will ultimately have to wait for more information directly from Blizzard about what player housing will look like.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW game director Ion Hazzikostas in an interview with GameSpot last year said Blizzard was announcing player housing far in advance of Midnight's release in order to "begin a conversation" and "double-check" that Blizzard's plans for player housing matched the expectations of players. Announcing the feature so far ahead of the expansion itself also gives the team time to pivot if changes need to be made, he said. More information about player housing and Midnight it slated to come this summer, according to WoW's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when players can unlock their apartment, the goblin-filled Undermine(d) update doesn't have a release date just yet, but is expected to release in the next month or two.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> Season 7, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, has arrived, bringing Diablo 3 Witch Doctor powers to the dungeon crawler. The new seasonal content features Headrotten enemies, which you will need to work with The Coven to defeat, increasing your standing with the faction. This means you'll need to partake in the revamped Tree of Whispers activities tied to the seasonal content. Completing these objectives will grant you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/diablo-4-battle-pass-season-7-rewards-all-cosmetics-titles-and-emotes/2900-6147/">battle pass</a> XP and loot for each chapter completed. The final chapter includes Dorian, a pet raven.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Your progress on objectives in chapters you haven't reached does track, but your progress in each chapter won't be reflected until that chapter has been reached.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_1">Chapter 1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4431857"></a><figcaption>Each chapter has two more objectives than are required to complete the chapter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4431857-seasonjourney.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">A Witch's Debt: Increase standing with The Coven to Rank 1 by completing Whispers.</li><li dir="ltr">Trinket's from the Nest: Obtain 1 Cache from the Raven during a Headhunt by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Veteran of Ashes: Acquire 666 Aberrant Cinders during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Spoils of Hell: Open 1 Tortured Gifts during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Trouble in the Wilds: Complete 5 World Events</li><li dir="ltr">Forager: Collect 100 Bundled Herbs from Harvest Nodes, Cellars, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Tanner's Apprentice: Collect 50 Rawhide from salvaging Armor, defeating Monsters, or various other sources throughout Sanctuary</li><li dir="ltr">Prospector: Collect 100 Iron Chunks from various sources</li><li dir="ltr">Deafening Whispers: Complete 10 Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Just a Sip: Upgrade your Potion to Tiny at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">In the Back Pocket: Discover the Armory to save and access builds</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These challenges are all fairly simple and should be completed without much effort, especially if you are skipping the campaigns with your new season character. The Armory might be one you need to go out of your way since it's a new feature, but shouldn't take much effort to complete. <strong>The Coven ranks appear throughout the Season Journey chapters and can be leveled by completing Tree of Whisper tasks, do not ignore these if you want to complete the Season Journey.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 1 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor (battle pass XP)</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Cache: Contains Consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">First Journey Crafting Cache: Contains Crafting Materials, such as Herbs and Gem Fragments</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_2">Chapter 2</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">In Service to the Tree: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 3</li><li dir="ltr">Taste of Power: Collect 5 Witch Powers from any Altar of Witchcraft found near the Tree of Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Twilight Dream: Acquire 1 Nightmare Dungeon Sigil</li><li dir="ltr">Pilgrimage of Nightmares: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Test of Mettle: Defeat 5 elite monsters</li><li dir="ltr">Prelude of Doom: Defeat 5 Harbingers during Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Notarized Nuisance: Increase your Threat Level to Max by defeating monsters during the Helltide</li><li dir="ltr">Risk and Reward: Buy 3 pieces of equipment from the Purveyor of Curiosities</li><li dir="ltr">A Master at Work: Complete 1 World Event with Mastery</li><li dir="ltr">Ruins Reclaimed: Clear 1 Stronghold</li><li dir="ltr">Capable Craftsmen: Learn 1 recipe of Rare or higher rarity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Another set of relatively easy goals here. The most likely ones to ignore are the Strongholds, just because you don't have to do those unless you really care about potential world activities there. The rest of these are fairly simple, if luck based, like the recipe of rare rarity, or are tied together, like multiple Helltide activities and Nightmare Dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 2 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Second Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, wish as Herbs and Veiled Crystals</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_3">Chapter 3</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 9 out of 11 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sacrificial Blade: INcrease your standing with The Coven to Rank 5</li><li dir="ltr">Rot Cleanser: Complete 5 Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Cave out the Necrosis: Defeat 5 Thrall of Rot, which can be found during Headhunts or in Rootholds</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Ancients: Unlock 10 aspects in the Code or Power, such as through completing Dungeons</li><li dir="ltr">Miracles of Alchemy: Craft 5 Elixirs at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Confront the Creature: Defeat the Blood Maiden summoned during Helltide with Baneful Hearts</li><li dir="ltr">Champion of the Lost: Clear 3 Strongholds</li><li dir="ltr">Basic Needs: Temper 5 Affixes onto gear at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Forsaken Offerings: Obtain 5 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Hard Fought Victory: Complete 1 Legion Event</li><li dir="ltr">Band of Killers: Defeat a World Boss while in a party</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 is where the tasks start to get a bit more involved, but the majority here are all tied to the seasonal content of The Coven and the related activities. The Blood Maiden is easier to defeat during a Helltide than you might expect, just because there are almost always other players grinding out kills as it's a good source of loot. An easy one to skip here is Band of Killers, as it requires you to have friends online at the same time as a World Boss is active, although you can try inviting nearby players while waiting for it to spawn.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 3 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Cache: Contains consumables, such as Elixirs and Whispering Keys</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Third Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge the Blood Maiden during Helltides</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Chapter_4">Chapter 4</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">In the Eyes of The Coven: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 8</li><li dir="ltr">Power Primordial: Upgrade 5 Witchcraft powers to Rank 10 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Damnation's Downfall: Defeat 1 Helltide Commander during Helltides, summoned after completing Helltide Events</li><li dir="ltr">Third Eye Open: Consume 5 Draught of Whispers to increase the likelihood of encountering Forgotten Altars and Fugitive Heads</li><li dir="ltr">Penitential Path: Defeat 666 Monsters in Penitent or Higher</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Nightmares: Complete 10 Nightmare Dungeon</li><li dir="ltr">Gifts of the Tree: Obtain 10 Caches from the Tree of Whispers by completing Whispers</li><li dir="ltr">Form and Function: Upgrade 5 gear by adding Sockets at the Jewler</li><li dir="ltr">Forged in Blood: Craft 5 Blacksmith Cache at the Blacksmith after reaching Level 60</li><li dir="ltr">Ceremonial Smoke: Craft 1 Incense at the Alchemist</li><li dir="ltr">Strength in Numbers: Complete 1 Legion Event while in a party</li><li dir="ltr">Born in Torment: Defeat 10 Hellborne spawned by reaching Max Threat Level during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This set of objectives should take you up through level 60. If you haven't swapped over to Penitent difficulty at this point, you should, as the added bonus loot and XP is a big bonus and your equipment is likely powerful enough. You need to prepare for Torment 1, which is required for one task here. You could ignore it, but you will need to move to Torment 1 for the next chapter anyway. The Legion Event in a party is also skippable, but these occur more often than World Bosses, so it isn't entirely difficult.</p><p dir="ltr">Chapter 4 rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greater Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Wound and Woe Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Veiled Crystals and Forgotten Souls</li><li dir="ltr">Fourth Journey Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Archetype Cache: Contains legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li><li dir="ltr">Otherworldly Player Title</li><li dir="ltr">Raven Player Title</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Slayer__Chapter_5_">Slayer (Chapter 5)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 12 of 14 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Slayer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Rite Keeper: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 15</li><li dir="ltr">A Tortured Gamble: Open 1 Tortured Gift of Mystery during Helltide in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Shards of the Fiends: Collect 5 Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">The Hordes Falter: Defeat the Fell Council 1 time in the Infernal Hordes on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Finder of Secrets: Find 1 Forgotten Altar</li><li dir="ltr">Headhunter: Collect 8 Fugitive Heads during Headhunts</li><li dir="ltr">Cultivate Fear: Collect 100 Obducite from such sources as Nightmare Dungeons or Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Lucid Nightmare: Complete 5 Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">No Mere Mortal: Unlock a Legendary Paragon node after reaching level 60 using Paragon points</li><li dir="ltr">Precious Shards: Salvage 100 Ancestral Legendary items</li><li dir="ltr">Transfer of Power: Imprint 8 Aspects onto Gear at the Occultist</li><li dir="ltr">Preamble: Complete Artificer's Tier 20 or higher in the Pit of the Artificer located in Cerrigar</li><li dir="ltr">Guilt: Defeat Tormented Echo of Varshan 1 time</li><li dir="ltr">Shock and Awe: Defeat Tormented Echo of Grigoire</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This chapter basically requires you to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-new-difficulty-options-explained-for-season-6-and-vessel-of-hatred/1100-6527180/">Torment 1</a> and max level. There is a large variety of activities here, but most only require you to run them a few times. The Obducite can be obtained from only a couple of Nightmare Dungeon runs and you need to do five anyway. The only ones you may want to hold off on are the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-2-how-to-summon-endgame-bosses/1100-6518613/">two bosses Varshan and Grigoire</a>, just because you may need to do the other activities to get your gear good enough to win those fights, but you will eventually want to do them for the loot regardless.</p><p dir="ltr">Slayer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Cache: Contains an Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Slayer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Champion__Chapter_6_">Champion (Chapter 6)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 11 of 13 objectives to complete this chapter.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Champion objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Unholy Coffers: Open 1 Greater Spoils of Hell chest after defeating the Fell Council in the Infernal Hordes</li><li dir="ltr">Warden of the Swamp: Increase your standing with The Coven to Rank 20</li><li dir="ltr">Warbringer's Wealth: Craft 10 Occult Gems learned from Grimoires</li><li dir="ltr">Drink Deep from the Chalice: Upgrade 10 Witchcraft powers to Rank 20 through the Seasonal Powers Panel</li><li dir="ltr">Glyph Expert: Improve 5 Paragon Glyphs to Rank 15 by completing The Pit</li><li dir="ltr">Echoes of the Ancients: Unlock 50 Aspects in the Codex of Power</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Challenge: Defeat 666 Monsters on Torment 2 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Forgiveness: Defeat Tormented Echo of Lord Zir</li><li dir="ltr">Harbinger of Ice: Defeat Tormented Echo of The Beast in the Ice</li><li dir="ltr">Horadric Smith: Masterwork 5 pieces of gear to Rank 5 at the Blacksmith</li><li dir="ltr">Preeminence: Reach Paragon Level 100</li><li dir="ltr">Thorn in Hell: Defeat 666 monsters while at Max Threat Level during Helltide on Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Coordinated Kill: While in a Party, defeat 25 Lair Bosses</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Depending on if you play Diablo 4 with friends or solo, the 25 Lair Bosses in a party is an easy skip. That does mean you will need to take on the two bosses listed here, but you should be in pretty good shape in terms of gear at this point, and you can leave them for last if you haven't. The most time-consuming task here is likely the 5 Paragon Glyphs at Rank 15, just because it will require quite a few runs of The Pit, even at high tiers, but that will help you get enough XP to reach Paragon level 100.</p><p dir="ltr">Champion rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Epic Favor</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Cache: Contains Infernal Hordes Compass and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Champion's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destroyer__Chapter_7_">Destroyer (Chapter 7)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>You must complete 8 out of 10 objectives to complete this chapter</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer objectives:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Silencer: Complete 5 Whispers within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Roots Ablaze: Open 15 Exposed Roots within 15 minutes during Headhunts in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Root Pulverizer: Activate 2 Legendary Ceremony Shrines within a single Roothold in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">Waking Horrors: Defeat 50 Elite Monsters while in Nightmare Dungeons in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Triumph of the Tormented: Defeat 666 Monsters in Torment 4 without dying</li><li dir="ltr">Bloodstained Hoard: Collect 750 Aether in a single run of the Infernal Hordes in Torment 4</li><li dir="ltr">With Sand to Spare: Complete Artificer's tier 75 or higher in The Pit, with more than five minutes remaining</li><li dir="ltr">Assassin's List: Defeat 5 Lair Bosses within 5 minutes in Torment 1 or higher</li><li dir="ltr">Hell's Fury: Defeat 250 monsters before the Hellborne's arrival after increasing your Threat Level to Max in Torment 4</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This list is pretty tough across the board, fitting for the final chapter. As for which ones to ignore and which ones to do, there are too many tough ones here to really make that call. Most of these require Torment 4, and you not only need to complete tasks, but do so quickly and without dying. This will require your build to be near complete, Paragon boards finished, and a strong understanding of your ability rotations.</p><p dir="ltr">Destroyer rewards:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Dorian pet Raven</li><li dir="ltr">The Raven Familiar Emblem</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Cache: Contains a Resplendent Spark and consumables</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Crafting Cache: Contains crafting materials, such as Obducite and Scattered Prisms</li><li dir="ltr">Destroyer's Summoning Cache: Contains summoning materials to challenge Bosses in Torment</li><li dir="ltr">Mystery Greater Archetype Cache: Contains ancestral unique and legendary items, materials, and a temper manual.</li></ul>

                <p>In 1994, Ted Price founded the company that would become Insomniac Games, the studio behind the Spyro the Dragon trilogy, Ratchet &amp; Clank, Resistance, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-spider-man-review-amazing-fantasy/1900-6416975/" data-ref-id="1900-6416975">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>. In addition to running the company, Price was the e was creative director on Spyro, Ratchet, and Resistance. Now, Price has revealed his plans to step down as Insomniac's CEO and retire from the video game industry. In his place, Insomniac has promoted three studio veterans to take the reins of the company.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the PlayStation blog</a>, Ryan Schneider, Jen Huang, and Chad Dezern are the new co-studio heads of Insomniac.
