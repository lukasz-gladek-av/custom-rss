                <p dir="ltr">With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, it's reasonable to expect that Nintendo might make a few policy changes to better reflect the company's intentions for the console. At least one of those changes comes with a cost, however: the Nintendo Switch Game Voucher program will be discontinued (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-for-this-great-nintendo-switch-game-de/1100-6468736/" data-ref-id="1100-6468736">permanently this time</a>) on January 30, 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch Game Voucher initiative allowed Switch owners to essentially pre-pay for two Nintendo Switch games--so long as they were <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/?srsltid=AfmBOoqBUETKdbeFodjuwuZJG0ArxVxXn91WyMjd4epmGfhgH22e08Bl#sort=df&amp;p=0">included in the program</a>--through the purchase of two Game Vouchers; the vouchers cost $100, while two games purchased separately would normally cost $120. Many of Nintendo's first-party releases--including Super Mario Odyssey, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, were included in the program.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7piZNI98ODk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7piZNI98ODk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/70933/kw/vouchers" rel="nofollow ">official Nintendo support site</a> made the discontinuation of the program official, saying that "as of 11:59 PM Pacific Time January 30, 2026, it will no longer be possible to purchase Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers." The post does mention, however, that any vouchers purchased between now and the end of the program will be redeemable for 12 months after the date of purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">"There will be no change to the way your game vouchers expire. Game vouchers remain valid for 12 months from purchase," the statement reads. "For example, if a set of Nintendo Switch Game Vouchers is purchased on January 30, 2026, each Nintendo Switch Game Voucher remains valid until January 30, 2027."</p><p dir="ltr">Previously, Nintendo confirmed that vouchers purchased through the program<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/psa-switch-2-games-dont-support-nintendos-game-voucher-program/1100-6532158/"> would not be able to purchase games for Nintendo Switch 2</a>. As of now, there is no replacement program on the new console.</p>

                <p>Seasoned Mario Kart players know to drift often to build up boosts and get some extra speed coming around corners. With charge jumps, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a> seemed to add yet another technique to get some marginal gains and edge out opponents--but the story isn't that simple.</p><p>Charge jumps, which are essentially drifts done on straightaways instead of corners, come with all the same visual indicators of granting a speed boost as classic drifting, but it turns out that the technique may technically slow you down. Following intensive investigation from the Mario Kart community, fans have seemingly confirmed that normal acceleration on a straight is preferable to charge-jumping.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmwKJiP4r-8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EmwKJiP4r-8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube user Karting All Day comprehensively explored the differences in speed between charge-jumping and normal racing in the video embedded above. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-charge-jump-speed-boost-too-slow-1851785905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> also independently confirmed the results across different top-speed builds.</p><p>So what, then, is the point of Nintendo even adding this capability to the game? There are a few reasons why charge-jumping can still be useful. In general, they're a way to gain access to certain things; a quick charge jump can get you up to the requisite height to grab a grind rail, and they can also help start wall rides.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched alongside the Switch 2 last month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">a commercial success</a>. Its tweaks and additions to the Mario Kart formula have inspired a wealth of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tips-and-tricks-to-help-you-cross-the-finish-line/2900-6670/" data-ref-id="2900-6670">tips, tricks</a>, and investigations, including one detailing how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-coins-dont-function-as-youd-expect-new-evidence-suggests/1100-6532471/" data-ref-id="1100-6532471">coins work slightly differently than you'd expect</a>.</p>

Ahead of that release, Bungie has made the past three years' worth of Destiny 2 content available to anyone, absolutely free.</p><p>Starting with 2022's The Witch Queen, you can now dive into the story of Savathun, explore the villain arc of The Witness in Lightfall, and watch it all come to a conclusion in The Final Shape until July 22. That gives you a few weeks to blast through the main story content of each of the expansions before diving into The Edge of Fate to find out what comes next.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge Of Fate Might Revitalize My Interest</p>
      </div>
<p>Alongside the expansions, Bungie has also given open access to all players to the Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy Episodes. These Episodes follow the events of The Final Shape, setting up the story for the new expansion as well as tying up a few loose ends left behind. These Episodes are only available until the release of The Edge of Fate, meaning they'll be unavailable after July 15.</p><p>However, all rewards, Titles, Triumphs, and cosmetics earned as part of those Episodes will remain on your account after the open access ends.</p><p>The Final Shape marked the conclusion of a decade-old saga, but The Edge of Fate starts a new story, with new enemies, and a fresh location to explore in the form of the planet Kepler. This time around, we'll be dealing with The Nine--a strange alien lifeforce which no one really understands. There'll be plenty of mysteries and secrets to uncover, and you can even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-break-the-new-destiny-2-expansion-but-bungie-wants-you-to/1100-6532890/" data-ref-id="1100-6532890">sequence break</a> the game in order to unravel them all, which Bungie says is intentional.</p><p>There are plenty of new additions coming with The Edge of Fate, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-livestream-all-the-new-exotics-weapons-and-artifact-mods/2900-6699/" data-ref-id="2900-6699">new weapons</a>, a complete overhaul of the gear system, and a new location to explore with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-kepler-destination-has-a-limited-time-activity-thatll-give-you-new-exotics/1100-6532892/" data-ref-id="1100-6532892">time-limited activity </a>never seen before. Alongside this, all players will have their power level reset to 200, meaning you'll no longer be horribly overleveled compared to your newcomer friends. That does come with the caveat that you might have to work a little harder to be ready for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-raid-race-start-date-duration-and-epic-raid-details/1100-6532888/" data-ref-id="1100-6532888">The Edge of Fate raid </a>race. If you're waiting for the perfect moment to force your unwilling friends into the sprawling space shooter, it might just be right now.</p>

                <p>Owlcat Games' The Expanse: Osiris Reborn is a space-set third-person action-RPG based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sci-fi-fans-can-save-big-on-the-expanse-complete-series-on-blu-ray-at-amazon/1100-6520164/" data-ref-id="1100-6520164">The Expanse TV series</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-expanse-james-sa-corey-captives-war-trilogy-amazon-prime-deal/1100-6525559/" data-ref-id="1100-6525559">the novels by James S. A. Corey</a> (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck). When the trailer debuted earlier this summer, the comparisons to Mass Effect were almost immediate. Alexander Mishulin--the game's creative director--recently acknowledged that Mass Effect influenced the development of Osiris Reborn. But the team plans to go in its own direction rather than simply copying Mass Effects' approach.</p><p>"It's different [from Mass Effect] in many ways," Mishulin told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/611007/expanse-osiris-reborn-mass-effect-comparisons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>. "First of all, we make our story a little bit differently. We're making more choices and consequences, and we want to make sure that this game still has a lot of them provided with a lot of agency."</p><p>As an example, Mishulin noted that players won't be locked into character paths like paragon or renegade. The player can decide whether their characters come from Earth, Mars, or the Belt. That choice will affect how NPC and companion characters react and relate to them during the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIQifuOTTe8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pIQifuOTTe8?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's story is set during the first two and a half seasons of The Expanse, and the player's character will be the captain of the most advanced ship in the galaxy. Regardless of the player's choices, the captain is also a twin, and both siblings are on board the ship. However, the twins may not always see eye-to-eye about the best course of action.</p><p>While there will be multiple romance options on the ship, Mishulin noted that Osiris Reborn will feature "a lot more convenient user interfaces [and] convenient approaches to the gameplay," rather than trying to replicate Mass Effects' gameplay.</p><p>Owlcat Games hasn't set a date for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn yet, but it will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. The studio is also currently developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dark-heresy-announced-from-rogue-trader-studio/1100-6531733/" data-ref-id="1100-6531733">Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy</a>.</p>
