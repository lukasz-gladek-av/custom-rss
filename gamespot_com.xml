                <p>When Donald Trump was running for reelection in 2024, he constantly spoke about his desire to add tariffs--or import taxes--on America's trading partners and rivals. Now, President Trump has gone through with that threat by imposing 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The Chinese tariffs are on top of the 10% tariff that Trump ordered on the country last month. Taken together, this new round of tariffs may spell trouble for physical video games, according to an industry analyst.</p><p>Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared his belief</a> that physical video games that would be subject to these tariffs may simply not be made. Instead, publishers are likely to lean even harder on digital sales. Piscatella has previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trumps-new-tariffs-could-lead-to-more-expensive-video-games-expert-says/1100-6528904/" data-ref-id="1100-6528904">written about the potential impact</a> of these tariffs, while noting that manufacturing game discs in America isn't a viable option since physical sales have been declining for years.</p><p>During Trump's first term in office, the video game industry successfully lobbied his administration to exclude them from the tariffs he placed on Chinese goods. There was no carveout in Trump's newest round of tariffs. The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) issued a public statement earlier this month warning that these tariffs <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-warns-trump-tariffs-could-harm-the-video-game-industry/1100-6529197/" data-ref-id="1100-6529197">may have a devastating affect on all video game sales</a>.</p><p>Because the costs of tariffs are almost always passed to customers, it's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these expenses. Piscatella has also indicated that the price of games--both physical and digital--may rise in response to Trump's tariffs. There's also fear that the tariffs could trigger an economic downturn or even a recession, which would further hurt players' ability to afford games.</p>

                <p>During its developer livestream on March 4, Bungie confirmed that Destiny 2's IO planet is coming back to the game. It will be the one of the locations where the new Heresy Act 2 activity, Court of Blades, will take place.</p><p>IO was sunset back in 2020 with the launch of Beyond Light to a critical response from players. In recent years, Bungie has also reprised formerly sunset planets including Mars, which was home to Savathun's Throne World, and Titan, where we rediscovered Sloane. This time around, IO's Remnants of Silver area will be the home of a new activity inspired by the roguelike elements that Bungie has been playing with in recent months.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453845"></a><figcaption>The return of IO's Remnant of Silver area</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453845-destiny-2-stream.jpg"></figure><p>IO is completely engulfed in Darkness, which Oryx, The Taken King, is desperately seeking out to regain power following his discovery that the Guardians were the ones to kill him. As he heads to IO, players will take part in the new Court of Blades activity and have direct interactions with him for the first time in years.</p><p>The Court of Blades is a matchmade activity designed to feel unique and challenging on each run. Bungie says it has "borrowed the concept of Augmentations from Onslaught" but that they differ in this case, as they provide challenges that players can find other ways to overcome. The Court of Blades also features a randomized set of armaments that are available for purchase between phases in order to combat those challenges.</p><p>Building a loadout will differ from day to day. Augmentations, the challenges applied to each run, begin to stack the more players complete the activity. It's possible to get a good combination that makes the run simple to complete, or a bad combination of certain bosses or Augmentations that just don't work together well. "We wanted players to have opportunities to shortcut those challenges, or combine the armaments to find a cool combo," Bungie says. Armaments will rotate on a daily basis, and Bungie hopes that this will generate a new meta each day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453846"></a><figcaption>Court of Blades Augmentation UI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4453846-destiny-2-stream%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Court of Blades activity is designed to take "around 10 minutes," activity designer Quentin Quinones-Rezin said during the livestream. There won't be any raid-like mechanics, nor will there be the health scaling seen in Act 1's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-nether-activity-explained-and-how-to-get-secret-loot/1100-6529277/" data-ref-id="1100-6529277">Nether</a> activity. "This is intended to be a bit of a less stressful, more fun activity, but the difficulty does escalate after every two challengers," continues Quinones-Rezin. The mechanics that Guardians can buy as armaments will sometimes provide antidotes or shortcuts to the Augmentations. Some you may recognize from the Nether, some will be brand new, and some will be borrowed from Exotics. For example, the Sunbracers effect can now be purchased in the Court of Blades using its currency, and could be effectively combined with something that increases ability regeneration.</p><p>Court of Blades will also feature an Expert mode for players looking for a challenge. While completing the Court of Blades activity will drop the Aptitude <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-destiny-2-heresy-weapons/1100-6529285/" data-ref-id="1100-6529285">Heresy weapons </a>more frequently, their Adept versions will only drop in Expert mode.</p>

                <p>PlayStation has unveiled a new beta program that will make it easier to access game betas, test out new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ps5/" data-ref-id="5005-128">PS5</a> and PlayStation App features early, and more.</p><p>Aptly called the "Beta Program at PlayStation," this new initiative is similar to the Xbox Insider program Microsoft currently runs for its gaming hardware and apps. Sony Interactive Entertainment's Sid Shuman describes this program as "an easy, centralized place for you to register your interest in a range of future PlayStation betas" in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/04/registration-for-new-beta-program-at-playstation-starts-today/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog post</a>. Essentially, players can now register at the program's official website and be in the loop on future beta initiatives by Sony.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759" data-ratio="0.56267409470752" data-width="1077" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453759"></a><figcaption>The official key art for the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4453759-playstationbetas.jpg"></figure><p>By signing up for the Beta Program at PlayStation, players will essentially be enrolled for a chance to gain beta access to future software betas that Sony holds for PlayStation. The PlayStation Blog post specifically calls out beta tests for PS5 and PC games, new PS5 console and PlayStation App features, and new UI capabilities on PlayStation.com. Companies like Sony need to thoroughly test games and software updates before they release them to the masses. This new program gives Sony a way to involve fans in that process.</p><p>While the website is down as of the writing of this article, the Beta Program at PlayStation initiative <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a website of its own </a>where interested PlayStation fans can sign up for free. All you need is to meet the age and region requirements and to have an active PlayStation Network account with no restrictions or violations currently applied to it.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>
