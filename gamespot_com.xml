                <p>Microsoft recently announced a major Xbox Game Pass price hike, but it's not going into effect right away in the US or abroad. Back when the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138"> 50% price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was announced on October 1</a>, people got emails from Microsoft saying when the change would happen for them, and for some people in the US, the price hike <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1974245210319196227" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wasn't set to go into effect until November.</a></p><p>Now, it's been confirmed that Microsoft will allow people to keep their existing membership rates in certain countries outside the US, so long as they do not cancel. If they do, the price will go up. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/794032/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-changes-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge confirmed with Microsoft</a> that the price increase only affects users in Austria, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Korea, Poland, and India if they cancel and then sign up again.</p><p>"At this time, these increases will only affect new purchases and will not affect your current subscription for the market in which you reside, as long as you are on an auto-recurring plan," Microsoft said in an email to subscribers in those regions. "Should you choose to cancel your plan and repurchase, you will be charged at the new current rate."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wAEKqYgIu4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9wAEKqYgIu4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft told The Verge members in the regions mentioned above can continue renewing at their existing price, but only "for now." This is due to "local requirements," Microsoft said. The email sent to members said they will be notified "at least 60 days in advance" of a price change. Given that, people in those regions shouldn't expect to pay the higher rates for at least a couple months.</p><p>In the US, existing subscriber should expect to begin paying the higher rates on November 4, Microsoft told The Verge. New subscribers in the US, however, must pay $30/month for Ultimate right now.</p><p>Also worth noting is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">numerous retailers in the US continue to sell Game Pass Ultimate for $20</a>, so people who want to keep their membership and pay less should grab those while they still can.</p><p>Microsoft is jacking up Game Pass Ultimate prices just ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release on November 14. As a result, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playing-new-call-of-duty-games-on-game-pass-just-got-more-expensive/1100-6535141/" data-ref-id="1100-6535141">playing Call of Duty on Game Pass just got a lot more expensive. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Have you been completing your daily Wordle challenge every day since the end of 2021, when the spelling puzzler first launched? If so, you may be the perfect candidate for the new game show that NBC is piloting. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/" rel="nofollow ">Deadline</a> has reported that the show is being filmed in the United Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">Savannah Guthrie, known for her role on NBC's Today show and other journalistic work, will host the show. The project comes from Jimmy Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog company, Universal Television Alternative Studio, and The New York Times. Fallon, who has said he is "addicted" to Wordle on The Tonight Show, will serve as an executive producer.</p><p dir="ltr">This show follows The New York Times’ acquisition of the Wordle, which was originally created by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle in 2022. The daily puzzle is still hugely popular. Last year, it was played 5.3 billion times, up from 4.8 billion in 2023. Everyone plays it, even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-pope-plays-wordle-and-words-with-friends-and-he-just-watched-conclave/1100-6531417/" data-ref-id="1100-6531417">Pope Leo</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This news doesn't necessarily mean that a Wordle game show will eventually air on NBC or Peacock. It still has several hurdles to overcome, including approval once the show is produced, before we’ll actually be able to see it.</p><p dir="ltr">CBS already has a Wordle-like show called <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/wordle-game-show-lingo-cbs-rupaul-1235091772/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lingo</a>, hosted by RuPaul Charles. It premiered in 2024 and has been renewed for future seasons. Lingo has been around for decades, as it originally began airing in the 1980s.</p>

                <p>Activision has announced that a new free trial for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will begin on October 9, which is just one day before EA's Battlefield 6 launches on October 10.</p><p>The free period runs for a week, ending on October 16. During the free period, people can play the campaign, multiplayer, and Zombies, along with the new content coming to the game for The Haunting event. October 9 also marks the debut of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season 6.</p><p>It's pretty common for Activision to launch a free trial around the time of a new season launch, as the company likes to give players a taste of the new content to convince them to buy the game or subscribe to Game Pass. The timing with the Battlefield 6 launch looks like a coincidence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4581694" data-ratio="0.56965174129353" data-width="1206" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4581694"></a><figcaption>A free trial starts soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4581694-screenshot2025-10-07at2.06.09%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 6 adds new maps, modes, weapons, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-6-arrives-to-black-ops-6-and-warzone-with-chucky-a-chainsaw-and-a-slasher-mode/2900-7113/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7113">a bunch of Halloween content, including new skins for Jason Voorhees, The Predator, and Chucky.</a></p><p>The next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Black Ops 7</a>, launches on November 14 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-extended-now-wraps-up-right-before-battlefield-6-launch/1100-6535266/" data-ref-id="1100-6535266">multiplayer beta is going on now.</a> As for Battlefield 6, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">releases on October 10.</a></p>
