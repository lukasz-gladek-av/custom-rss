                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-apes-hit/1900-6418328/" data-ref-id="1900-6418328">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, the remaster of the Wii and 3DS video game that was developed by Retro Studios. However, players have noted that the original team members at Retro are not given individual credits in the updated version. Instead, the credits state that it was "based on the work" of Retro Studios, while the team at Forever Entertainment gets its credits for working on the remaster. Now, Nintendo has issued a statement about the situation.</p><p>"We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process," said a Nintendo spokesperson to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p>That statement doesn't really address why the original team's names were excluded from the credits, and this has happened before. In 2023, the Retro Studios developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/" data-ref-id="1100-6511491">left out of the credits</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/" data-ref-id="1100-6511575">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/external-translators-are-frustrated-with-lack-of-credit-in-nintendo-games/1100-6524935/" data-ref-id="1100-6524935">external translators voiced their frustrations</a> last year because Nintendo didn't credit them for their work either.</p><p>This story has been largely overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">the reveal of Switch 2</a> earlier this week. It seems likely that the Donkey Kong Country franchise will be revisited on that system as well. However, it's not among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">games rumored for Switch 2</a>. In the meantime, the bizarre Donkey Kong Country animated TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nightmare-fuel-donkey-kong-country-tv-series-is-free-to-watch-on-youtube-and-amazon/1100-6505494/" data-ref-id="1100-6505494">is still available to watch on Prime Video</a>.</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a>, the end of one chapter almost always leads into another. The recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-gets-new-legendary-weapons-and-increased-caps-in-revenant-act-3/1100-6528729/" data-ref-id="1100-6528729">conclusion of Revenant Act 3</a> set the stage for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-past-is-prologue-event-starts-soon-offering-hard-to-get-rewards-in-new-ways/1100-6528865/" data-ref-id="1100-6528865">the Past is Prologue event</a> starting on January 21. Looking even further ahead, the next episode, Hersey, is set to launch next month with a brand-new dungeon, Sundered Doctrine.</p><p>The new dungeon will bring players back to Savathûn’s Throne World as they infiltrate the Pyramid Ship of their old enemy Rhulk, who was dispatched by the Guardians in The Vow of the Disciple. Rhulk may be gone, but there are bound to be some nasty surprises waiting for players inside his ship. And the best players in the game are invited to take part in competitive race to finish Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode, which has enhanced difficulty and an even greater challenge than the normal settings.</p><p>Ahead of the debut of Sundered Doctrine, we've put together this guide to everything you need to know about the race, including how to enter it, how to watch, and what has to be done to claim the ultimate reward for this event.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Sundered_Doctrine_launch_">When does Sundered Doctrine launch?</a></li><li><a href="#What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</a></li><li><a href="#How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</a></li><li><a href="#What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_does_Sundered_Doctrine_launch_">When does Sundered Doctrine launch?</h2><p>Sundered Doctrine will launch on Friday, February 7. For the first 48 hours, players will compete in a race to be the first to finish Sundered Doctrine in the more difficult Contest Mode. This time, there can only be one winning fireteam, and the contest will conclude as soon as someone pulls off that feat.</p><h2 id="What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>During the first 48 hours after Sundered Doctrine's debut, any fireteam of three players can enter the Contest Mode if all team members are at 1995 Power Level or higher. Each member of the team is also required to own The Final Shape Dungeon Key and the The Drowning Labyrinth quest before entering Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</h2><p>It's not an exaggeration to say this is going to take a team effort, because the only way that Sundered Doctrine can be conquered is if each member of the fireteam has completed and received loot for every encounter. Additionally, it has to be the first time completing the encounter for every member of the team.</p><p>Assuming players make it past the final encounter of Sundered Doctrine, they have to loot the final chest to officially record their victory. But it's not going to be easy, as Contest Mode has a very high difficulty with more aggressive enemies and an enrage mechanic that limits the number of phases or the time players have left to complete it. Having a higher power level than 1995 won't give anyone a special advantage, as that will be the cap for every player in this contest. There will also be resurrection tokens during encounters.</p><h2 id="What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>The three players on the winning fireteam will receive a special emblem and a guaranteed exotic weapon drop. However, Bungie hasn't yet shared the details about which exotic weapon will be featured in Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</h2><p>The DungeonZone coverage of the Sundered Doctrine race will begin with a pre-show at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday, February 2. The live coverage will start two hours later at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET. Fans can follow the action at the following outlets:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/evanf1997" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a></li></ul><p>Note that the TikTok stream will only be active if the site isn't shut down as scheduled on Sunday, January 19. In 2024, the US government passed a law to ban TikTok if the site wasn't sold by the Chinese company ByteDance. As of January 17, that seems unlikely to happen before the deadline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429255" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429255"></a><figcaption>The Trigonic Amber emblem from Destiny 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg"></figure><p>Viewers who watch the live coverage will be able to claim the Trigonic Amber emblem for free.

                <p>Movie fans worldwide were shocked to hear of influential filmmaker David Lynch's death this week. Just 78 years old at the time of his passing--he would have turned 79 on January 20--Lynch rose to prominence with films like Eraserhead, Blue Velvet, and the cult-hit TV series Twin Peaks across the '80s and '90s.</p><p>While his strange and surreal approach to filmmaking would inspire several other big names in Hollywood, Lynch also had an impact on video games, with numerous titles having (or claiming to have) a Lynchian feel to their design. One video game series that he has a surprising connection to? Nintendo's Legend of Zelda games, as various key creatives behind the series cited Twin Peaks as a catalyst behind some of the weirder elements in several Zelda games.</p><p>Fittingly, several video game studios and professionals have posted tributes online to Lynch. Alan Wake 2 creative director Sam Lake shared his condolences, as the recent game starring the troubled author is heavily inspired by Lynch's work, with the first game having a heavy Twin Peaks vibe in particular. "The internal codename for Alan Wake 2 was 'Big Fish,'" Lake wrote, referencing Lynch's autobiographical and self-help book. <a href="https://app.bsky.cz/profile/samlakewrites.bsky.social/post/3lfuyhxkjhs2i" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In another post on BlueSky</a>, Lake commented on how Lynch had been a big influence in his life.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> game director Hideo Kojima also said farewell to the film legend with an X/Twitter post. Kojima's work has been heavily influenced by cinema over the years, with his recent Death Stranding games also evoking a weird--but artful--direction that wouldn't look out of place in a Lynch film.</p><p>The Witcher 4 narrative director Phillipp Weber commented on Lynch's passing, praising him for the deep empathy that he had for his characters.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PhiWeber/status/1879974351661068451" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I admired most about David Lynch's work was the deep empathy he had for his characters.<br>It is something that I feel is rare nowadays with a lot of contemporary storytelling.<br>We lost a truly great auteur, and I am sad to exist in a world without him.

On YouTube, his regular weather reports ran for hundreds of videos, he was a celebrated musician, and he was a prolific visual artist.</p><p>"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch. We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There’s a big hole in the world now that he’s no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole,'" Lynch's family wrote in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidlynchofficial/posts/pfbid04LuZED6SrWevszQ1UZoEED6x95znKc7scJxXFL5B1icBKgCiu4T2qYLHsErFNzELl" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook post</a>.</p>
