Devil May Cry established the franchise formula with its stylish combat and nearly unstoppable protagonist Dante, while Devil May Cry 3 fleshed out the lore of the series and properly introduced Dante's brother Vergil, who has become a fan-favorite character over the years.</p><p>For <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Devil+May+Cry+Finds+A+New+Home+On+GOG%27s+Preservation+Program&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-06-18+06%3A14%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-18+06%3A14%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6532525&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Standard+News&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fdevil_may_cry_4_special_edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fdevil-may-cry-finds-a-new-home-on-gog-preservation-program%2F1100-6532525%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition</a>, the changes here are the same as the HD Collection.

                <p dir="ltr">Look, I respect it. I think it's cool to consistently label the Vault Hunter that's most fun to play across multiple games with the same title of "Siren" so that I and so many others can correctly pick who to play for our first playthrough of whatever the latest Borderlands game is. And who wouldn't want to play as the Siren, the mystic-like class that can warp reality with their mind to support allies or unleash massive destruction? No one, that's who. So, of course, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a>'s resident Siren, Vex, is going to be a blast.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, granted, when I played Borderlands 4 for three hours at a preview event, we were only allowed to try two of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/" data-ref-id="2900-6583">the four playable Vault Hunters</a>: the aforementioned Vex, and Rafa, the Soldier. "So you don't know for sure then, huh?" I hear you ask. And, sure, maybe the Gravitar or Forge Knight do end up being more fun to play than Vex. I doubt it, though. Lilith, Maya, and Amara are my favorite characters in their respective games, so why would Vex break that trend?</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Especially since Borderlands 4 clearly does not break trends anywhere else. The latest entry does change things up by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/" data-ref-id="1100-6532503">adding long-requested features</a>, like implementing firearm customization, more types of movement, and quality-of-life features, and replacing auto-healing with healing items. But even if it does play better (a lot better in some cases--healing whenever I want is a game-changer), this still <em>feels </em>like every Borderlands game that came before it. If you have played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands/" data-ref-id="5000-32783">Borderlands</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-2/" data-ref-id="5000-112742">Borderlands 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel/" data-ref-id="5000-264457">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-3/" data-ref-id="5000-454301">Borderlands 3</a>, you already know whether you're going to enjoy Borderlands 4. The answer was inside you all along! The trends remain unbroken! Borderlands 4 looks to be a familiar experience that continues to deliver what fans want from the series.</p><p dir="ltr">As GameSpot's resident Borderlands sicko, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. I have enjoyed playing the Borderlands games and I would like to continue playing an experience that I have liked in the past. But if you've never liked Borderlands or have fallen out of love with it in recent years, this game isn't likely to suddenly change your mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516111" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516111"></a><figcaption>During the preview, I got to play as both Vex and Rafa.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516111-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest game in the sci-fi looter shooter series seems to take cues from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny</a>, putting players into a seamless world that you can sprint, glide, grapple, and hover-bike through, while random event-like encounters pop up, and a round and floating robotic companion points you to your next objective, scans and fixes machines you find, revives you when you die, and digitally constructs your hover-bike. Borderlands 4 is still very clearly a Borderlands game, but I was repeatedly struck by how certain moments of my time with it felt <em>so much</em> like I was suddenly replaying a vanilla version of Bungie's 2014 first-person shooter, just with wildly different narrative trappings.</p><p dir="ltr">Vault Hunters continue to be the core of gameplay, informing your playstyle based on their unique abilities. Vex is primarily a summoner with specialities that allow her to create void apparitions--one gives her a dog-like skag, another lets her create multiple copies of herself, and the last one gives her wings and forms an orb that fires eldritch blasts. Meanwhile, Rafa is geared toward dealing as much damage as possible--his first specialty summons energy blades for him to wade into melee, the second gives him piercing energy lasers, and the third gives him shoulder cannons to fire bombs, bullets, and homing missiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516112" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516112"></a><figcaption>I wasn't as big a fan of Rafa.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516112-ss_9817e59ff344dc00aeb154bcdb9820cd89774ad4.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I feel like I've made my point about this clear, but Vex is so much better than Rafa, who doesn't affect how you play the game--he's the general all-rounder who takes what Borderlands is all about (shooting stuff with guns) and does it even better. I understand why he's there. Every Borderlands game has at least one Vault Hunter who is there to fill the role of "soldier" for players who want a more traditional shooter option. I can still think they're not as fun to play, however. Vex, meanwhile, encourages you to play with a strategy, as you need to thoughtfully place summons in key spots and lean into mobility and positioning to account for her poor defensive buffs. I like that, especially as it highlights the new movement mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to the last two Vault Hunters, who I didn't get to try, what I most want to see from them is that their abilities have a substantial impact on how I approach a firefight. In my mind, this has always been the most crucial aspect of whether a Vault Hunter is fun to play as, generally, all are built to at least be useful. The ones that are the most fun are the ones that pull you furthest away from just shooting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516113" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516113"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4's other two Vault Hunters are the gravity-controlling Harlowe and axe-wielding Amon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516113-ss_7d5167fb618abd99e0e076f66963988544467d27.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless of your choice, all Vault Hunters benefit from Borderlands 4's faster and deadlier combat. Enemies hit way harder and pursue you more aggressively, and this puts a stronger emphasis on relying on movement and cover in enclosed or narrow spaces. The new traversal mechanics like the double-jump, glide, and grappling hook can make all the difference, and firefights that lean into that dependency are altogether better than anything Borderlands has had so far. There's delightful satisfaction to pulling off trick shots and platforming around the battlefield to keep out of danger and avoid getting cornered, which just aren't present in shootouts in wide-open fields. It takes some getting used to being mobile--and I died plenty of times trying to pull back and be more reserved rather than pressing the offensive and speeding around the battlefield--but once you do, it's a lot of fun.</p><p dir="ltr">It will be interesting to see how movement is incorporated into boss battles, if at all. I got to play through a raid boss a few times, clearing it twice solo before jumping into co-op and doing it again with a partner, and the fight was mostly just circling around a big enemy and shooting it a bunch. This has been a major issue in Borderlands for several games now--the bosses are dull because the difficulty is dictated by a huge health bar, not a test of skill. There's some hope, though. The boss I faced had a second phase where it would occasionally leap onto the ceiling and fill the arena's floor with acid, forcing me to grapple from one descending platform to another while dodging attacks, shooting the boss, and keeping track of which platforms I could grapple to next. It was a brief thrill in an otherwise okay boss fight. I hope other bosses lean more heavily into forcing the player to move around and think about positioning during the fight.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516114" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516114"></a><figcaption>I was surprised by how many moments in Borderlands 4 now feel like playing vanilla Destiny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516114-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not holding my breath, though. This feels like a Borderlands game through and through where enough has changed for me to feel like this is an improvement over Borderlands 3, but it's not so different that I can expect huge and sweeping changes. I'm not going to abandon playing as a Siren or ask my friends who are not Borderlands fans to try the game. I know who these games are for: people like me. Is it possible the snippet I played does not at all reflect the full experience? Sure. But I'm guessing it's a pretty accurate snapshot and that Borderlands 4 is yet another game in the franchise that gives you exactly what you're expecting.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on September 12.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> feels like an improvement on its predecessor. The game doesn't chase after trends and instead sticks to the looter-shooter format that the franchise has iterated on for years. It makes for a game that will likely prove popular for long-time fans but, I suspect, won't necessarily convince newcomers to finally give the series a try. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-continues-the-trend-of-making-sirens-the-most-fun-to-play/1100-6532501/">Sirens are still incredibly fun</a>, bosses still take a tremendous amount of bullets to take out, and there are still so, so many different firearms to find.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing Borderlands 4 for about three hours at a preview event, I sat down with senior project producer Anthony Nicholson to talk about the improvements implemented in this latest entry, such as mission replay (so you don't have to start a brand-new save or jump into True Vault Hunter mode just to redo a mission or boss to get better loot), a seamless world, and manual healing kits. Our conversation is detailed below, edited for both brevity and readability.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Official 18 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the team hoping to get out of revisiting this series again?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Anthony Nicholson</strong>: Well, I think a lot of it is improving on the systems, the design, and the features that we've had in Borderlands 3 and then the prior games. So what we wanted to do was we knew the kind of things that people were really into whenever it came to Borderlands 3. And then of course in the DLCs, [creative director] Graeme [Timmins] and I were talking about it--I was the head of DLC for Borderlands 3 [and] he was the creative director on the live stuff so we got to listen to a lot of things. We got to see a lot of the improvements and the things that [the team] tried there.</p><p dir="ltr">And there's a lot of things that we've always wanted to do, and technologically we couldn't. But now on Borderlands 4 we're running on Unreal Engine 5. So that allows us to be able to do more of the things like the seamless world to have bigger sprawling zones, to be able to do dynamic events and some of those more random types of events and activities and things that can happen. And so I think [Borderlands 4] really came from a drive of wanting to do things that we have always wanted to do before, like mission replay. That's [a feature] that we've wanted to do since Borderlands 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516141" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516141"></a><figcaption>You can now heal whenever you want as long as you have health kits to spare.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4516141-ss_dca90df5ee8033682a27f4cf3757b68d950dc71c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's something I've wanted since Borderlands 2.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: So it's for people like you. There's those types of things. And then there's also the successes that we saw like the movement suite and movement abilities. We think that we can push this a little bit further because people responded so very well to that [in Borderlands 3]. And now in this game, we've added even more to the traversal and to those mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When you're talking about the "seamless world," what exactly does that entail? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: So for us, it means multiple things. It's not just the world, it's not just the map itself. There's no loading when you're transitioning from zone to zone or the big landscape pieces. And so that along with being able to instantaneously spawn a vehicle and just hop on and go wherever you want to, that's seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">You can walk back after you beat a boss [and] pretty much hit a button and the boss respawns. You jump back into the arena and now you're back into it. No quitting to the main menu and dragging your friends, breaking up the party and all those types of things. Matchmaking [has changed] and we [now] let people jump into the game--drop in, drop out co-op--and all of that is seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">And then we're exploring because the landscape is so vast. If you're way on the east side of the Fate Fields and I'm on the west side and I'm like, "Oh, you're doing something cool over there," [I can] open up my map, find where your icon is, hit it, [and] I instantaneously travel to you. That's also seamless.</p><p dir="ltr">So it really means a lot of different things.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516140"></a><figcaption>You and a friend can separate by a fairly substantial distance if you want, so long as you're both in the same zone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516140-ss_9d3dcc47ceb489bf76f6d613a797bf1db3a7ca22.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Speaking of the co-op, how far apart can teammates get from one another?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: As long as you're in the same zone. So if you're in the Fate Fields and I'm in the Fate Fields, we're on the Fate Fields together on whichever side.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What was the design philosophy behind changing the auto-heal feature to a button you have to press, creating an incentive to hoard healing items? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: It's another one of those things that we have done in this game to give the ownership of player urgency. Players are a part of cutscenes now. You're a part of it. You're pushing the story forward. You're a part of the growth there. But also whenever you're using a rep kit now you are the one who's determining [when you heal].</p><p dir="ltr">So you can at any point, like you said, know, "I can heal myself when I need to." It's almost a slight cool down. Different manufacturers of the different rep kits have different boosts and stuff like that, but also there's buffs to those because it's like its own piece of gear, just like a shield or ordinance. So you could have a rep kit that increases damage. You could have one that increases fire rate or movement speed, and it's healing you all at the same time. So it really is another way for you to have a tool in your box to build around whatever it is that you want your spec to be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516105" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516105"></a><figcaption>Borderlands 4 will focus its humor through the banter of the Vault Hunters rather than reference current real-world events.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4516105-ss_7db66b7fbc823a1e3283b7c969f360c999aaac8d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Humor is a key part of every Borderlands game. What goes into trying to make a game humorous? Because what's funny today might not be funny a year from now and games are designed so many years prior to actually coming out.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: That's a really good question. All of the points that you say are things that we understand and that we take into the process whenever we're building and planning and developing the story and all the things that we're doing there. So we are really proud of what we've done on the past games, but to your point, those came out at a different time. And we believe that our audience, our community, grows alongside our games, too. So we need to adapt. Things that are happening back then or in the world back then are very different from things that happened now, right?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Right.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicholson</strong>: [For] Borderlands 1, the development team and the goings on in the world [were] very different from 2025. And so just to your point, we want to make sure that we [reflect] that. But to be clear, [Borderlands 4] is still very humorous. It's just the way that we approach [it] that [has changed]. We now make sure that the Vault Hunters themselves are the ones who are driving [the jokes] and they're the ones who are being [funny]. So when we say [Borderlands 4] has grounded humor, we mean it's more situational comedy between [the Vault Hunters] as opposed to pulling things out from the real world and things like that [like the series used to].</p>

Treyarch confirmed the game won't include futuristic movement abilities like wall-running or jetpacks, as have occasionally appeared in past Call of Duty games.</p><p>Details about the movement system and Black Ops 7's campaign settings were confirmed during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/F7NvcBZJzbQ?si=bVB3tpPRBo34-BbH" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Call of Duty podcast</a>. Podcast host Stephanie Snowden shut down rumors of potential wall-running and jetpacks in Black Ops 7. When co-host Miles Ross asked about Black Ops 7's movement, Snowden replied, "I can confirm no wall-running, no jetpacks, but it will feature an evolution of omnimovement."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While some fans may be disappointed in another year of boots-on-the-ground Call of Duty, leaks suggest Black Ops 7 could feature some form of a "wall-jump" or double jump with this evolution of omnimovement.</p><p>The episode also included an interview with Treyarch's associate creative director, Miles Leslie. Leslie discussed Activision's reveal trailer it showed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">June's Xbox Games Showcase</a>, as well as some of the Easter eggs hidden within. The developer also confirmed part of the campaign shown in the trailer takes place in Japan. </p><p dir="ltr">"We're super excited about this because Black Ops has never gone really deep into Japan," Leslie said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to Japan, it's also confirmed that part of the campaign takes place on the long-rumored Avalon map. It was originally rumored that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-think-theyve-discovered-the-next-warzone-map/1100-6527488/">Avalon would be the next Warzone map</a>, but recent leaks suggested it was scrapped for battle royale and would instead be used for campaign and Zombies content. The speculation of an Avalon battle royale map returned after Black Ops 7's trailer included a scene with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/">squad flying down onto Avalon with wingsuits</a>, with fans hoping it was teasing a Warzone or Blackout-style battle royale map.</p><p>According to Snowden, the scene in question is part of Black Ops 7's co-op campaign set on Avalon, which will support up to four players. Snowden didn't outright say the content isn't also made for battle royale, however, so there is still hope for fans wanting battle royale on Avalon. Call of Duty's battle royale maps are often made with parts of campaign settings.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the hosts acknowledged the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy launch of Season 4</a> for Black Ops 6 and Warzone. "When there are bugs or issues present in the game we know that that is frustrating," Snowden said. "Since then, we've been focused on patching and updating a number of those issues."</p><p dir="ltr">The podcast hosts also confirmed the final Zombies map for Black Ops 6 will arrive with the launch of Season 5. Call of Duty still has plenty of content to arrive before then, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-4-start-date-and-details/1100-6531690/">Season 4 Reloaded</a> set to bring more multiplayer maps, events, and game modes.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 launches later this year for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.
