                <p>Bungie finally lifted the lid on its extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/">Marathon</a> this week, and while the game looks like a vibrant entry in the genre, it has been negatively compared to Sony's live-service flop Concord. Both games share similar elements, being live-service sci-fi shooters with a colorful art direction, but one former Concord developer wants people to not only give Bungie's project a chance when it launches later this year, but to also show some compassion for the people working on it.</p><p>"After reading the comments about Marathon being Concord 2.0 on Reddit, YouTube, and Twitch, I just wanted to share a little insight into what a 40-year-old man is feeling after dedicating a large portion of his life to making videogames," former Firewalk Studios senior VFX artist Stephan Williams wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jyr8dm/former_firewalkconcord_dev_talks_marathon/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Marathon subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/marathon-concord-comparisons-ex-firewalk-dev-weighs-in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VG247</a>). "Seeing the faces of the developers on the Bungie stream gave me hope and excitement for what is to come for Marathon," Williams added. "I commend them for taking a chance, trying something foreign to them, that isn't proven, nor guaranteed to succeed. It takes a lot of courage."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Williams explained that while Concord "failed to inspire players," there were lessons to be learned from that "gut-wrenching" failure. Now a senior VFX artist at Warframe studio Digital Extremes, Williams stressed that video games are meant to be fun and that people need to be kinder to the developers working on them behind the scenes.</p><p>After its big livestream, Bungie revealed quite a few details on Marathon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">from its September 23 release date</a> to a closer look at the maps players will battle each other on as they hunt down some loot. The big question surrounding the game for now is its price, as while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/">Bungie says that Marathon won't be a full-priced game</a>, it is promising a "premium" experience. If you're one of the people who'd like to give it a chance, you can try your luck at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">snagging a key to join the game's closed alpha playtest</a> later this month.</p><p>"Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue," Tamoor Hussain wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">GameSpot's hands-on preview of Marathon</a></p>

                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/72j7U131efodyDK64WTJua" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its colorblind simulation tool</a>, Chroma, to the general public after several years in development. It's available to check out over on <a href="https://github.com/ubisoft/UbiChroma" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Github</a>.</p><p>In the announcement, Ubisoft explained that there are an estimated 300 million people across the globe who are impacted by colorblindness. Chroma's purpose is to simulate the three major colorblindness types: Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia.</p><p>Ubisoft also said that its quality-control team in India started developing Chroma in 2021. The team wanted to create a tool that could provide real-time feedback so developers could simultaneously control the game and simulate colorblindness.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png" data-ref-id="1300-4476672" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="960" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png" data-ref-id="1300-4476672"></a><figcaption>Chroma in action</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4476672-image_2025-04-14_234124656.png"></figure><p>Now that it's open-source, developers simply have to apply a filter over the game screen  and it can simulate live gameplay up to 60fps. Chroma utilizes the Color Oracle algorithm and is compatible with single and dual screens. It also works with hotkeys and has a customizable overlay.</p><p>"Chroma is a testament to the team's innovation and dedication; their work is already making a difference in how we design games with accessibility in mind," said Ubisoft QC product manager Jawad Shakil. "Open-sourcing Chroma is a proud step forward, allowing everyone to benefit from this innovation."</p><p>Ubisoft isn't the only large developer aiming to make accessibility available to the general public. Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-just-made-two-accessibility-patents-open-source/1100-6528289/" data-ref-id="1100-6528289">Electronic Arts made two of its patents open-source</a>. One of them was a speech-based patent that made it easier for players' speech to be recognized and reflected in-game. The other was an Unreal Engine 5 plugin called IRIS, which automatically alerts developers to moments in their games that could cause seizures in players with photosensitive epilepsy.</p>
