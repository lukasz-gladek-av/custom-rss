                <p dir="ltr">Codes have begun being sent out for early access to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 beta</a> taking place later this month.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by the fan-run page BF Bulletin, emails began going out on August 1 to players who signed up for Battlefield Labs, a community development program EA has been running to playtest features ahead of Battlefield 6's launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you get your code, you're going to want to log in to your <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/battlefield/battlefield-6/code-redemption/" rel="nofollow ">EA account</a>, make sure it's linked to the profile and system you plan to play on, and redeem it there. Once that's done, you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">As announced at the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-everything-we-learned-about-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-features/2900-6835/">multiplayer reveal event</a>, anyone who managed to sign up for Battlefield Labs before July 31 is eligible for early access. This grants access on August 7-8, ahead of the first open beta weekend on August 9-10. </p><p dir="ltr">Don't worry, if you didn't manage to sign up for Battlefield Labs, which is currently closed to any further sign-ups, the upcoming beta is open to everyone. As long as you have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-skipping-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6533611/">console</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-pc-specs-revealed-and-you-wont-need-a-military-grade-pc-to-run-it/1100-6533619/">PC</a> that can play Battlefield 6, you can hop in on the fun both the weekend of August 9 and the next, running from August 14-17.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know what the beta will consist of, but it's probably safe to assume that it'll be much of the content that was available at the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/">multiplayer preview event</a>. The developers have said that players will be able to pick between open or closed weapons in the beta though. For the unfamiliar, this simply means that you can opt between the classic Battlefield experience where weapons are locked to certain classes or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 lands on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10, and this entry not only marks the series' return to a modern era, but the first time in years that a Battlefield game will be releasing around the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-and-battlefield-are-getting-new-games-in-the-same-year-for-the-first-time-since-2021/1100-6533628/">same time as its most direct competitor</a>, Call of Duty.</p>

                <p>An official Blizzard forum post has warned players of the perils of buying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> gold from a third party. However, Blizzard's reminder that you can instead buy gold officially hasn't gone over well with some in the WoW community.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW community manager Kaivax recently <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/buying-gold-from-third-parties-is-forbidden/2139797" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reminded</a> players that buying gold from a third-party seller puts a user's account at risk of being hacked, and that players should protect their account and help to maintain a fair gaming environment by shunning the practice.</p><p dir="ltr">"Purchasing gold from other players puts your account at risk of being hacked and supports companies that steal accounts, operate bots, and disrupt the game economy," Kaivax states.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying gold from a third-party seller is also against WoW's end user license agreement. Those who do could have that illegally acquired gold removed by Blizzard or have their account permanently banned.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players should never buy gold from other players with real money," Kaivax states. "Remember--you should only accept gold from players that you know, or through crafting or profession agreements made using in-game chat. Always avoid gold trades intended to cross game variants, realms, or factions that are not explicitly supported by the game."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fairly standard account-safety PSA that isn't out of the ordinary. But it's the last sentence of the post that has riled up some in the WoW community on places like the forums and on <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/blizzard-wants-players-to-remember-the-wow-token-is-the-only-safe-way-to-buy-377946#comments" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, as Blizzard goes from offering information players can use to protect their account to what comes across as Blizzard trying to sell a product.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only safe way to purchase gold is via the WoW Token, which provides a convenient and sanctioned exchange of gold for game time or Battle.net balance directly through the in-game auction house," the forum post concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard introduced the WoW Token back in 2015 as part of the game's Warlords of Draenor expansion. A player can buy a WoW Token directly from Blizzard for $20. That token can then be sold on the game's auction house in exchange for gold. The player buying the token can then use that token to pay for 30 days of game time or add it to their Battle.net balance.</p><p dir="ltr">The post has ruffled feathers for a few reasons. For starters, it comes off as an advertisement for the WoW Token, which has long been a controversial addition to the MMO. In recent years the WoW community has argued whether the fact that players can officially buy as much gold as they want from Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-cant-decide-whether-or-not-the-game-is-pay-to-win/1100-6494862/" data-ref-id="1100-6494862">makes the game "pay-to-win."</a> Money, as they say, is power, and with unlimited gold a player can buy many of the best items, rare mounts, or pay other players to run them through content in order to reap lucrative rewards. Blizzard isn't selling players power directly, but they are in a roundabout way by letting players buy gold instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players would like to see the WoW Token removed entirely. Others would like to see Blizzard do more to combat bots and account-scammers outside of offering its own, legally sanctioned way to buy gold.</p><p dir="ltr">Another issue is that, as many in the replies to the forum post point out, some players are unable to buy the WoW Token in their region or in their preferred version of WoW. Some players on the forums state they play in Brazil and have no way to buy the WoW Token, as it's not supported in the country, while others state they play one of the many versions of WoW Classic, which don't support the WoW Token. Blizzard's post encouraging players to buy gold officially, despite many being unable to do so due to where they live or the version of WoW they play, comes across as tone deaf to some.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does regularly ban bots, and even occasionally makes in-game changes to make botting more difficult. In 2023, it banned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-wrath-of-the-lich-king-classic-is-making-it-harder-to-create-death-knights/1100-6512418/" data-ref-id="1100-6512418">120,000 "malicious accounts"</a> that were using the ability to make high-level Death Knight characters in Wrath of the Lich King Classic for botting, and added restrictions to new accounts to prevent them from doing so. At the time, Blizzard said it regularly bans tens of thousands of accounts per week.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-players-will-get-surprises-and-major-midnight-news-at-gamescom-this-year/1100-6532635/" data-ref-id="1100-6532635">Midnight, will be fully revealed at Gamescom</a>. The expansion will introduce the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">player housing feature</a> to the MMO.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Battlefield series is known for destructive environments and combined-arms combat across large-scale maps, but for the first time in several years, Battlefield 6 returns the franchise to the modern era for an entry that has the potential to be a proper successor to Battlefield 3 and 4. Major environmental destruction is back, and the game steps away from the unpopular specialist operators of Battlefield 2042 in favor of the more traditional class system.</p><p dir="ltr">"We loved Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and we wanted Battlefield 6 to be inspired by that," VP and executive producer Christian Grass said when discussing the studio's focus for the game. "We wanted to make sure we nailed the tactical destruction system, we wanted the classes to be great, and we wanted the core combat system to be the best we've ever created."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Combat, Classes &amp; Destruction Breakdown Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"We knew what we knew what we needed to do in the beginning," Ripple Effect creative director Thomas Anderson added. "To take the best parts of Battlefield 3 and 4 and just push those to quality."</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 dives back into this modern setting with a global conflict that provides a pleasant variety of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-maps/2900-6834/">map locations</a>. We were able to get hands-on with five different maps across various modes. We fought gritty, close-quarters fights in the streets of New York on the Empire State map, while Liberation Peak served as a large, mountainous landscape with tons of wide-open spaces for snipers. Siege of Cairo is a sprawling desert map for large-scale modes like Conquest, but we also played a smaller slice of the locale for the more condensed Squad Deathmatch mode. These smaller maps are pulled from the larger map designs, but placement of objects and how destruction is used has been altered to fit the smaller play area.</p><p dir="ltr">The Squad Deathmatch mode provides the opportunity to step away from Battlefield's typical large-scale warfare and go for a more hectic pace with in-your-face action moments that feel more in line with an experience you’d get from a Call of Duty multiplayer match. These feature four squads of four fighting on small maps to be the first to rack up a certain number of kills. You still have roles to play in Squad Deathmatch, and with such close-quarters action and more opportunities to die, the medic-style Support class is very useful here.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, Battlefield 6's large-scale modes are where the game shines. Our multiplayer session included the familiar modes of Conquest, Domination, and Breakthrough. This is where the destruction feels more impactful, as certain buildings can serve as power positions to hold flags, but you can change the direction of the fight by simply collapsing all the floors with well-aimed rockets or a grenade launcher. I've always found the destruction in older Battlefield games to be extremely satisfying, and it feels even more so in Battlefield 6. Targeting a building often doesn't just take away the frontside or a specific chunk; you can collapse several floors and sometimes an entire building of a structure on top of opponents. And that makes it a significant hazard to watch out for when moving through interior spaces.</p><p dir="ltr">Tanks can now more easily drive through structures as well. Enemies behind a wall? No problem: You can just drive a tank right through concrete walls to take them out, while also forging new pathways for your teammates. Tanks were really fun to drive and use to bully right through enemy defenses. As for air support, I'm the pilot most likely to crash and wipe my whole squad. From what I can tell, flying vehicles seem like a blast to use; helicopters and jets were crashing everywhere in a way only Battlefield does.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these destructive and cinematic moments come at a cost, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-skipping-ps4-and-xbox-one/1100-6533611/">Battlefield 6 is moving away from last-generation consoles</a>. When discussing the improvements in technology, Christian Grass said, "It's really difficult from a technological and balancing point of view to create the package that is Battlefield. There are so many things that are competing in terms of computation power that we need. The vision of Battlefield 6 wouldn't have been possible on the previous generation."</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of the destruction elements, another Battlefield signature is its class system with weapons tied to each role. Being an Engineer once meant you had to use a submachine gun if you wanted to repair tanks, or you'd need to wield a light machine gun if you wanted to play a support role for the match. Now, Battlefield 6 aims to break that mold without losing the feel of the class-based roles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542165"></a><figcaption>Tanks in Battlefield 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542165-bf68large.jpeg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4542166,1300-4542167,1300-4542168,1300-4542169,1300-4542170,1300-4542171,1300-4542172,1300-4542173" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542166-bf61large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542167-bf62large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542168-bf63large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542169-bf64large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542170-bf65large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542171-bf66large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542172-bf67large.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4542173-bf69large.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The traditional class system was one of the loudest talking points prior to Battlefield 6's reveal. Originally, the developers announced that every weapon would be available regardless of class, but there was backlash from the community, as many players didn't want the game to lean away from the traditional Battlefield class system. Battlefield Studios listened, and now players will have the freedom to choose between having weapons unlocked or choosing a classic weapon-locked system for Battlefield 6.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who's played a ton of Battlefield games over the years, I was curious which way I'd lean in the great class debate. We spent around seven to eight hours playing the Battlefield 6 closed beta, and I often found myself choosing to go outside the specialized weapons for the Support and Engineering classes. Honestly, call me a Battlefield disloyalist if you want, but I rarely wanted to use a light machine gun when playing Support, and I almost never wanted a submachine gun when playing as an Engineer on the large-scale maps and modes. That's not to say that the submachine guns don't feel great, but I preferred to use them when playing in close-quarters scenarios on the smaller Squad Deathmatch maps.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says the choice for locked or unlocked weapons will be available in the beta and at launch. Additionally, there are no XP penalties for choosing one option or the other. "We're confident in our design," Andersson said, "But if people don't agree or a niche of players don't agree, they can play [weapons locked.]” "They can play however they want," Grass said, jumping in. "We're happy as long as you're having a good time playing Battlefield 6."</p><p dir="ltr">Each class will still have its own role to play, and my time with Battlefield 6 never felt like I wasn't playing a meaningful class type when I did swap my weapons. However, it can be beneficial to stick with a class's specialized weapons, as you get trait bonuses for using that weapon type. For example, the Recon class rewards snipers with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope speed, and improved breath control to stabilize aim for longer. Non-Recon players who use a sniper might feel at a slight disadvantage, but they can still complement that weapon choice with other tools available to their class.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the specialization bonuses, each class comes with its own unique gadgets and a special class-specific Active Ability that can be used and recharged over time. For example, the Recon class features the Active Ability to call in a UAV, and the Engineer Active Ability allows you to repair more efficiently for a limited time.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement is also improved in Battlefield 6. The game features what Battlefield Studios call a "Kinesthetic Combat System," which is basically a whole mouthful just to say there are new maneuvering actions to help you excel on the battlefield. With this updated system you can now peek and lean around corners, mount weapons against a surface to reduce recoil, hitch a ride on the sides of tanks, and even drag teammates while simultaneously reviving them. These actions are very situational, but the most impactful is the ability to drag and revive downed friendlies while moving them to the safety of cover. I definitely saved more lives during my time with Battlefield 6, and it really makes you feel like a hero while performing these revives .</p><p dir="ltr">These are early impressions that point to a strong start for Battlefield's return to a modern landscape. It's also worth mentioning that this beta build of the game felt extremely polished, and I didn't encounter any lag or performance issues. Out of the several hours played, I only experienced one instance of a bugged optic on my assault rifle, which caused a prismatic color pattern to appear in the scope and block my view.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, we only got to play a handful of maps and modes, with a total of nine maps confirmed for launch, including the return of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. The popular game mode Rush is also confirmed to return, but we didn't get a chance to play it at the reveal. There is still content yet to be seen, and we also don't yet have a good indication of what the game's post-launch content might look like.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if the game would keep thematically appropriate skins and bundles for Battlefield 6, or if they had plans to add wacky Call of Duty-style bundles, Grass said, "Battlefield 6 is a modern military shooter." The developer also referenced the skins designed for the premium Phantom Edition of Battlefield 6, which are soldiers in black suits that still keep the style and gear of modern military uniforms. Of course, that doesn't mean the future won't include something a bit more outlandish. "We're talking about now and not necessarily the future, but we are a modern military shooter," Grass reiterated.</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, my early impressions for Battlefield 6 suggests a strong return to the modern-day setting and a positive step towards balancing the classic experience with updated mechanics and freedom for all playstyles. All the big action moments are there, the destruction is exciting and more impactful than ever, and the gunplay feels solid. So far, it's shaping up to be the more direct successor to the beloved Battlefield 3 and 4 that many fans have been waiting for.</p>

                <p>Adult games--and games with adult themes--have been delisted from digital game sales portals Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> recently, following pressure from companies that process those platforms' payments to remove them. After an extended period of silence on the matter, Mastercard has released a statement and says that its recent actions are based on the "rule of law" and aren't an attempt to enforce censorship.</p><p>"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p>It's worth noting that there has been no evidence that the games removed from Steam and Itch.io included illegal content, and for an even deeper breakdown, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired</a> and <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/steam-itch-takedowns-credit-cards-1.7597563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CBC have detailed timelines</a> on the entire situation so far. Visa also put out a pre-written response to complaints (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/616835/visa-mastercard-steam-itchio-campaign-adult-games/" rel="nofollow ">Polygon</a>), adding that it didn't aim to "make moral judgments on legal purchases" and that it was also adhering to the letter of the law.</p><p>The pressure from payment processors was apparently the result of a campaign by the Australian anti-porn lobbying group Collective Shout, which has taken credit for the actions. Collective Shout released an open letter claiming that Steam and indie games storefront <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a> hosted games with "rape, incest and child sexual abuse" content.</p><p>It has also released statements claiming to have sent about 1,000 emails and calls to payment processors, urging them to threaten to pull support from those portals unless those games were removed. But the result has been the delisting of any game with vaguely defined adult content. Developers say that games with LGBTQ themes or content have been caught in the purge, and many have criticized the payment processors for arbitrarily enforcing their moral standards--and Collective Shout's--on what adults are allowed to buy and play.</p><p>In the weeks since payment processors have stopped supporting payments for adult content, several sites have been forced to take drastic measures. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steams-updated-guidelines-allow-banks-to-enforce-standards-on-adult-only-content/1100-6533253/">Steam began purging content</a> from its storefront--and it made a vague update to its terms of service--while Itch.io <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-is-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-following-ban-on-adult-games/1100-6533545/">also began to de-index content from the site</a>.</p><p>Earlier this week, the site began to "re-index" adult and not safe for work content, adding that it is still in ongoing discussions with payment processors. Itch.io has long used Stripe as its payment processor, but the financial site will no longer support the sale of adult content that fits the description of “content designed for sexual gratification" on Itch.io.</p><p>The last couple of weeks have seen massive pushback against payment companies, as game organizations, developers, and artists have rallied together. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/international-game-developers-association-seriously-alarmed-by-recent-delisting-of-games/1100-6533536/">has called for "greater transparency and fairness"</a> in the moderation of adult games, while other groups have urged people to put pressure on the two payment processors and flood them with calls to register their concerns about censorship.</p>

<p>"We always said that with all of this investment and with all the potential of this franchise, we would not have put it in harm's way, and we would not have put it out in the blast radius of something really large," she said. "We were pretty unblinking, and we weren't allowing ourselves to play the, 'What if?' game with the schedules and development. We were like, 'No, we have to get this done,' because the opportunity is so big and the potential is so significant for the company."</p><p>GTA 6 was originally scheduled to release in Fall 2025 before Take-Two delayed the game to May 2026. After the GTA 6 delay, EA management said the launch window for Battlefield 6 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">"clearer than before."</a></p><p>As for Black Ops 7, Activision has not announced a release date yet, but a report said the game will launch on November 14, which would give Battlefield 6 about a month's space.</p><p>Timing is important for game releases, and some have theorized that another EA game, Titanfall 2, launching sandwiched between Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare back in 2016 negatively impacted that game's sales. There was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/titanfall/comments/amrf7h/jason_schreier_on_the_tf2_release_date_mishap/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more to the story</a>, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 10. An<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515"> open beta</a> kicks off very soon, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode is coming later. </a></p>
