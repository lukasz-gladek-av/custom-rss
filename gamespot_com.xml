                <p>The time of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo: Infinite</a> is coming to a close. Microsoft and Halo Studios have revealed that the game's next major update, Operation: Infinite, will be its last. The announcement came on Friday during Halo Studios' Halo: Infinite livestream.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yT_lkR3V4-0?si=8JYCsywDbhhGSiTp" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p>In a message posted to <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/operation-infinite-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Halo site</a>, Halo Studios thanked fans for supporting Infinite. The team also indicated that this decision was made to allow the devs to focus on "multiple Halo titles in development." This part is nothing new or surprising, given that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">saying for over a year now</a> that there are multiple new Halo games in development.</p><p>"With multiple Halo titles in development, we'll need our whole team's combined focus to deliver new experiences with the same passion and care that our community has given us," reads the statement. "While we remain committed to supporting Halo Infinite on the road ahead, Operation: Infinite is the last major content update currently planned."</p><p>The only Halo game confirmed to be in development at the moment is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved/" data-ref-id="5000-700149">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the original Halo that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">bring the franchise to PlayStation 5</a> for the first time. Separately, there have been rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-halo-game-may-be-like-fortnite-with-live-service-report/1100-6535547/" data-ref-id="1100-6535547">a live-service Halo game</a>, which remain unconfirmed for now. If those reports are accurate, that game could be the spiritual successor of Halo Infinite.</p><p>Earlier this month, Sandy Peterson shed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-mmo-was-killed-to-protect-execs-stock-bonus-developer-claims/1100-6535871/" data-ref-id="1100-6535871">some light on the Halo MMO</a> from Age of Empires developer Ensemble Studios that was canceled in 2008. According to Peterson, that project never saw the light of day because then head of Xbox Don Mattrick canceled it to protect his stock bonus.</p><p>Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto recently said that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-warms-my-heart-original-dev-says/1100-6535722/" data-ref-id="1100-6535722">Halo remake "warms my heart,"</a> while another former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-halo-developer-slams-campaign-evolveds-changes/1100-6535720/" data-ref-id="1100-6535720">Halo dev slammed some of the remake's changes</a>.</p>
