                <p>Legendary game designer and programmer Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island) has revealed that one of his exciting-sounding upcoming projects has been canceled due in part to investors not coming to the table to fund the project.</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/12/after-40-years-of-adventure-games-ron-gilbert-pivots-to-outrunning-death/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Ars Technica</a>, Gilbert said this game had a vision of being a "large, open-world-type RPG" in the vein of The Legend of Zelda. Gilbert worked alongside two other people--an artist and a designer--for about a year on the project before Gilbert realized it was not going to happen.</p><p>"I just [didn't] have the money or the time to build a big open-world game like that," he said. "You know, it's either a passion project you spent 10 years on, or you just need a bunch of money to be able to hire people and resources."</p><p>Gilbert previously described his new project as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monkey-island-creators-next-game-is-best-described-as-classic-zelda-meets-diablo-meets-thimbleweed-park" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park,"</a> and a lot of people were excited to find out what that might look like. Now it's not happening.</p><h2>"Horrible" publishing deals</h2><p>Gilbert said he pitched the project to people in the industry but discovered that "deals that publishers were offering were just horrible."</p><p>The kind of game Gilbert envisioned "isn't the big, hot item" so potential publishers didn't invest, he said. "The amount of money they're willing to put up and the deals they were offering just made absolutely no sense to me to go do this," he explained.</p><p>Gilbert funded 2017's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/thimbleweed-park-review/1900-6416642/" data-ref-id="1900-6416642">Thimbleweed Park</a> on Kickstarter, bringing in more than $600,000 USD. Gilbert also took private investment to complete the project.</p><p>The industry veteran observed that publishers today can be "very analytics-driven" and have devised their own formulas to "try to figure out how much money they could make." The result of this, Gilbert observed, is that publishers take on less risk, and in turn, games that do get made often look the same.</p><p>"You end up [getting] a whole lot of games that look exactly the same as last year’s games, because that makes some money," he said. "When we were starting out, we couldn't do that because we didn't know what made this money ... I think that's why I really enjoy the indie game market because it's kind of free of a lot of that stuff that big publishers bring to it, and there's a lot more creativity and you know, strangeness, and bizarreness."</p><p>Gilbert's latest game is Death by Scrolling, an action game that was released at the end of October this year. Before that, he partnered with Devolver for Return to Monkey Island.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Getting 100% completion in a Metroid game--and metroidvania titles in general--is a satisfying achievement that's part of the genre's appeal. However, in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, there is unfortunately a way to pigeonhole yourself where collecting everything needed isn't possible. Now, the game will warn you about a point of no return, but it's still easy to make a regrettable decision. That's why GameSpot's reviewer for the first-person adventure, Steve Watts, advises players to make a copy of their main save in another save slot before entering the endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Watts detailed the "confusing choice" that Nintendo and developer Retro Studios made in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review-prime-but-not-quite-prime-prime/1900-6418446/">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>. "When I was ready to proceed to the endgame, I got the usual warnings about a point of no return, but I had figured I could always load an older save to go back and do more exploring to pick up power-ups that I missed," Watts wrote. "But the auto-save now has me locked into the final area with no such apparent option, and my regular save slot--the one that activates when Samus steps into a save station--has been overwritten with a Mission Complete, so loading it prompts me to start a new game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The main menu does allow you to make a copy of a game in a different slot. If you want to proceed to the endgame to see how the story concludes, while allowing freedom to go back and explore, make sure that you either make a copy of your save or opt not to overwrite with a Mission Complete save. That said, there's always the possibility that Nintendo and Retro address this confusing issue with a future update for the Switch and Switch 2 game.</p><p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4 launches tomorrow, December 4. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-features-a-new-samus-aran-voice-actor/1100-6536668/">features a new voice actor for Samus Aran</a> with Erin Yvette replacing previous Metroid Prime mainstay Jennifer Hale. In addition, Krystle Martin provides the motion capture for the bounty hunter.

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has enjoyed an exceptional year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">becoming the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards</a>. Its cast--Ben Starr, Charlie Cox, and Jennifer English among them--earned major recognition in the show's performance categories, helping cement the game as one of the year's standout achievements. But even while celebrating this success, the cast has been discussing ways the awards could grow, especially when it comes to recognizing the full range of performance work that brings modern games to life.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-cast-calls-for-the-game-awards-to-add-a-motion-capture-category/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Games Chronicle</a>, cast members English, Shayla Nyx, Devora Wilde, and Aliona Baranova shared their hope that The Game Awards will eventually expand its performance categories. They explained that, while the nominations are an honor, the current categories overlook many essential performers.</p><p>"If I may, can I put my petition forward for why we need to have a motion capture category?" Baranova said. "It's been decades of actors going in, doing the mocap, and then someone else's voice is popped on top, and those mocap performers just disappear. I forgot that. Nobody knows about them.” Baranova, who worked as a motion capture director on Baldur's Gate 3, noted that this issue has persisted for years.</p><p>She added that recognition could also help audiences better understand the craft. "The audience doesn't know enough about this because there's not enough attention on it," she continued. "If we had an award category for mocap specifically, then studios would be encouraged to release that behind-the-scenes footage because people are desperate for it. Studios keep that a bit quiet because it gives away details on how they made the game."</p><p>Actor Charlie Cox echoed the sentiment last month, saying that although he's "thrilled" about his nomination, credit for his role in Expedition 33 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-actor-says-hes-truly-grateful-for-outpouring-of-support-after-charlie-cox-spoke-out/1100-6536509/" data-ref-id="1100-6536509">must be shared with motion capture performer Maxence Carzole</a>.</p><p>"It needs to happen," Baranova added. "I posted about it online the other day, and some people were questioning like, "How would we do it?'. I don't know, they can figure it out. We need to do it because there are these fantastic mocap performances going on."</p><p>Devora Wilde agreed, saying, "Yes, I was actually surprised about that for The Game Awards. But I think that's always been the case, hasn't it? It's just been 'performance in a game'."</p><p>The Game Awards will stream live from the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles on December 11, and in case you didn't know, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quick-reminder-you-can-vote-in-the-game-awards-now/1100-6536609/" data-ref-id="1100-6536609">you can also vote in the awards</a>.</p>

                <p>Prediction markets have been popular for years, and now Roblox's top boss has said he wants to see them integrated into the hugely popular game someday.</p><p>CEO Dave Baszucki told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a>, "We would. I think we would have to do that."</p><p>It's not so easy, though, as Baszucki said every country has different legislation surrounding "loot boxes and kid gambling," so there are regulatory hurdles that would need be sorted out.</p><p>Baszucki is bullish on the idea, even if it might take time to come to fruition. For what it's worth, the interviewer and host laughed at the idea of prediction markets in Roblox.</p><p>"I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it," he explained.</p><p>Prediction market platforms like Polymarket and Kalshi are peer-to-peer platforms where people can buy and sell contracts tied to any number of events, including professional sports and culture events like which movie will win Best Picture. They are different from traditional sports betting platforms because there is no "house" setting the odds.</p><p>Prediction markets in the US are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, an agency of the US government that recently granted approval to Polymarket to function in the US. Its main rival, Kalshi, was approved by the CFTC years ago.</p><p><a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kalshi recently reached a deal with CNN</a> to feature its markets in the CNN newsroom, a decision that drew much debate and discussion online. Prediction markets, like traditional sports gambling, have been a hot-button issue, with many saying it's bad and dangerous for many different reasons.</p><p>Currently, Kalshi has a number of open markets for gaming, including a <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards/kxgameawards-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">market for Game of the Year at The Game Awards</a>. More than $2.3 million has been exchanged so far on this market, with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 far and away the leading choice to win.</p><p>Baszucki made headlines recently when he was asked in this same interview about child predator concerns in Roblox. His response was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-ceo-responds-to-child-predator-concerns-poorly/1100-6536445/" data-ref-id="1100-6536445">not what many people wanted to hear.</a></p><p><em>Thumbnail image from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/13529953420/Money-Race" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Money Race game</a>.</em></p>
