                <p>Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations</a>. After a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">quick retraction and explanation</a>, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?</p><p>According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/feature/concept-artists-in-games-say-generative-ai-references-only-make-their-jobs-harder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week In Video Games</a>, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively.</p><p>"I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. "It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way."</p><p>Another freelance designer and illustrator, Kim Hu, who worked as the lead artist on Rollerdrome (and possible the world's biggest fan of Marvel's Taskmaster), says even starting with AI images "robs you of discovery, as it will likely more or less give you exactly what you asked of it", and says that looking at the real world and references helps with creation and maybe adds on something you didn't think of before, "informing and branching out your ideas further." She adds that going down these accidental rabbit holes is a pivotal step in concept and world-building for her.</p><p>A senior concept artist, who asked to remain anonymous due to their position at a major game developer, told Tran that studio leadership now asks them to work from AI-generated reference material. They said that this often requires "reverse engineering where the pieces of the image composite came from, and working off what I'm able to find through careful searches on the internet--things like hairstyles, clothing, props, and so on."</p><p>Beyond protecting the company from potential legal risk, particularly given that the project involves a well-known IP, the artist said they feel a principled obligation to take on this extra work for the benefit of their colleagues. "When I'm putting a design package together for a 3D artist, either in-house or offsite, they need actual references they can use instead of wasting time deciphering what's in the output image 'references.' I feel responsibility for the others I work with on my projects--this is a normal part of my job."</p><p>AI implementation has polarized the industry, with some studio heads more than willing to move forward with it. Netflix was even looking for an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-hiring-a-new-genai-gaming-boss-with-a-huge-salary/1100-6535200/"> AI leader for its games department </a>over the fall, and at the beginning of the year, Microsoft invested $80 billion--while still admitting that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">tech will lead to job losses</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-nintendo-switch-2-titles-have-the-full-game-on-the-game-card/2900-6508/">Game-Key Cards</a> have been divisive since they were first introduced, but the good news is that the full R-Type Dimensions 3 game will be on the Switch 2 cartridge. The bad news? You're going to have to pay a little bit extra for that side-scrolling shoot-'em-up, as the price is going up to €70.</p><p>It's worth noting that those who already preordered the physical Special Edition will not see their price change.</p><p>Publisher Inin Games had <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/regarding-the-physical-format-on-nintendo-switch-2-please-read-carefully" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previously explained</a> that switching the entire run to standard cartridges would have resulted in manufacturing costs increasing by "at least" €15 per game copy, which is why it chose the Game-Key Card option. Inin Games pledged to look for a way to release the full game on a Switch cartridge, <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leading to today's news </a>about the costs increasing, but not as much as it anticipated.</p><p>"There is no better timing," the publisher said in an update. "Two days ago Nintendo announced two new smaller cartridge sizes for Nintendo Switch 2. This allows us to recalculate production in a way that wasn’t possible before."</p><p>Nintendo has not officially confirmed the existence of smaller-sized cartridges for the Switch 2, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but it's rumored</a> that developers will soon be able to choose between 16GB and 32GB cartridges, instead of the expensive 64GB cartridge.</p><p>Game-Key Cards function as physical authentication keys for the Switch 2, as you'll still need to download the full game to the console. Storage capacity is limited, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsd-express-cards-nintendo-switch-2-best-deals-available-now/1100-6530578/">microSD Express cards can be expensive</a>, which is one of the reasons why the system has been criticized. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/">While they can be resold and aren’t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they do pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Game developers have spoken in defense of Game-Key Cards, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-key-cards-may-be-controversial-but-ubisoft-defends-them-for-star-wars-outlaws/1100-6534502/">with one Ubisoft dev explaining</a> that technical limitations made it necessary to release Star Wars Outlaws in this format. Earlier this year, Nintendo also launched a survey to explore what its users think of physical and digital game ownership.</p>

                <p>Gaming on the go has been popular among players for decades, and now Sony and Honda are teaming up to bring the power of PlayStation 5 to the road. The two companies formed a joint venture, Sony Honda Mobility, in 2022 to produce electric vehicles. Their first car, the Afeela 1, will be released next year and it will include the capability of playing PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 games.</p><p>However, this a limitation to what players can do with their Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment systems. Sony and Honda aren't including in-car consoles, and they are relying on PlayStation Remote Play for this to work. That means Afeela 1 owners will also need to have either a PS5 or a PS4 at their homes in order to connect with the systems to play games. Sony notes that this use of Remote Play is separate from streaming PS Plus games from the cloud.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626163"></a><figcaption>The Afeela In-Vehicle Infotainment system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4626163-sonyhonda.jpg"></figure><p>This setup includes integrated display and premium audio systems for passengers. It's unclear if the cars come with a PlayStation controller or if players have to bring their own from home.</p><p>"The introduction of PS Remote Play embodies Afeela's vision for mobility: transforming the traveling space into a captivating and emotional one," said Sony Honda Mobility COO Izumi Kawanishi <a href="https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/news/2025-12-18/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in a statement</a>. "Through this integration, we are elevating the customer's entire travel experience to an unprecedented level of entertainment."</p><p>Afeela 1 will be available in California first before it goes nationwide. But aside from a 2026 release window, it doesn't currently have an on-sale date.</p>

                <p>Overwatch developer Blizzard has teased that 2026 will be the year when the studio's "boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>"We're eager to take creative steps that will allow the game to lean further into storytelling and character development, and we can't wait to share these new experiences with our community," Blizzard said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/18/xbox-bethesda-blizzard-activision-king-2025-games-thank-you/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. "There's a real sense of momentum and optimism within the development team, and we believe 2026 will be a year where our boldest ideas come to life."</p><p>Blizzard did not share any further details, but 2026 marks the 10th anniversary of Overwatch, and the studio presumably has some anniversary plans in store for the milestone.</p><p>Also in the post, Blizzard ran through some reflections of the past year, saying 2025 "brought out the best in the Overwatch team."</p><p>"Inspired by the evolving landscape of the industry, we embraced the opportunity to take bold risks and focused on making impactful changes rather than playing it safe," the developer said. "The response from our community has been amazing, and we feel our relationship with our players is stronger than ever."</p><p>Blizzard also called out how Overwatch 2 relaunching in China was a "standout moment" for the game in 2025. "Despite the absence, the community’s passion remained strong, with fans organizing offline events, creating art, and supporting esports. This enduring passion for the Overwatch universe highlighted how the game brings people together and means so much beyond just gameplay, reinforcing our excitement for the future," the developer said.</p><p>2026 marks the 35th anniversary of Blizzard, and studio president <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-biggest-year-yet-coming-in-2026-for-35th-anniversary-president-says/1100-6537061/" data-ref-id="1100-6537061">Johanna Faries said it will be the "biggest year yet" for the company.</a> The company is bringing back BlizzCon in September 2026 to share a number of "major" announcements.</p>
