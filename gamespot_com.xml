                <p>In 2015, Obsidian Entertainment launched Pillars of Eternity, a party-based real-time tactical RPG. Now Obsidian is making one of the most significant changes to the game in the last 10 years by introducing a turn-based mode. And Pillars of Eternity players will be able to get their hands on it this week.</p><p>On the <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official site</a>, Obsidian announced that the public beta for Pillars of Eternity's turn-based mode will go live on November 5. The real-time combat was inspired by the system used by the game's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" data-ref-id="5000-475262">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>. The studio also released an announcement trailer for the new mode to demonstrate it in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="189">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?start=189" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Obsidian, the following real-time improvements were made after taking fan feedback from Deadfire.</p><ul><li><strong>Unbound Turns</strong>: All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions</strong>: Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing</strong>: Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility</strong>: You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p>As noted above, players can choose whether or not to embrace turn-based combat, or switch between real-time and turn-based at their desire. The beta test doesn't currently have an end date, but Obsidian notes that it will release future updates in support of this before adding turn-based mode to the game as a permanent feature.</p><p>Josh Sawyer--who directed both Pillars of Eternity games--has suggested that if Pillars of Eternity 3 ever goes forward, it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-baldurs-gate-3-style-3d-if-it-ever-happens/1100-6532470/" data-ref-id="1100-6532470">embrace the influence of Baldur's Gate 3</a> and switch from an isometric perspective to a 3D-style game.</p><p>Earlier this year, Obsidian released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a>, an action-RPG that takes place in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-series-lore-of-eora-is-here-to-remind-you-its-part-of-the-pillars-of-eternity-franchise/1100-6528947/" data-ref-id="1100-6528947">the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity games</a>.</p>

                <p>Switch 2 players have spent several months cruising through Mario Kart World's large open-world map, but if you're looking for a way to make those drives through the Mushroom Kingdom even more immsersive, you'll want to check out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Numbskull's official Joy-Con steering wheel</a> accessory that's set to launch on November 22. The device is larger and more robust than the simple Joy-Con wheel accessories already available, but at just $30, it's also much more affordable than the advanced steering wheel peripherals found on PC and other platforms. If you're interested in checking it out for yourself, you can preorder Numbskull's Switch 2 Joy-Con Steering Wheel now at Amazon.</p><div title="Numskull Switch 2 Joy-Con Wheel Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4873" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Numskull Switch 2 Joy-Con Wheel Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Numskull Joy-Con Steering Wheel for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases November 22</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Numskull's official Joy-Con Steering Wheel resembles more advanced racing wheel accessories from brands like Logitech, and even features realistic resistance and feedback mechanisms. However, instead of utilizing its own steering sensors for inputs, it uses the Joy-Con 2's built-in gyro sensors and rumble function. The wheel features two slots that both Joy-Con 2 fit into, so you can access the Switch 2's standard button layout while enjoying a more realistic way to play racing games with motion steering. The wheel attaches to desks or tables with suction cups under the base, and since it simply uses the Joy-Con 2, you don't need to plug it into your Switch 2 or provide it with any power. Note that this accessory is not compatible with the original Nintendo Switch, as the Joy-Con has a different shape and size.</p>                      </div><p>This new steering wheel accessory isn't the only Switch 2 controller peripheral designed for racing games and gyro controls, but it's certainly the most robust and immersive of its kind released so far. That said, the other options are worth checking out, too, since they're smaller and even <em>more </em>affordable than Numbskull's new device. Nintendo offers its own official <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-17-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1FRRJP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wheel for Switch 2 Joy-Con</a>, which is available to buy on Amazon. One set comes with one blue wheel and one orange wheel. There are also a few other third-party options, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Steering-Racing-Compatible-Nintendo-2/dp/B0F9WCMQGT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TNP steering wheel</a>, the ergonomic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-2/dp/B0FFCGW32L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fosmon wheels</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/HEYSTOP-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Ergonomic/dp/B0F2FR71DW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heystop 4-pack of Joy-Con 2 grips</a>, which includes two wheel attachments and two additional controller-shaped grips. Unlike Numbskull's full-size wheel, these Joy-Con 2 drips don't attach to a base; instead, you slot in a single Joy-Con 2, hold it out in front of you, and twist it to simulate steering. It's less realistic, but they're a good option for younger and more casual fans who want a comfortable way to play racing games with gyro controls, especially if you plan on sharing the Joy-Con 2 controllers with another player.</p><h2>Switch 2 Racing Wheel Accessories</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-2/dp/B0FFCGW32L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fosmon Switch 2 Ergonomic Grip</a> -- $10.81</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HEYSTOP-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Ergonomic/dp/B0F2FR71DW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heystop 4-Pack of Joy-Con 2 Grips</a> -- $20</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Numskull Joy-Con Steering Wheel for Switch 2</a> -- $30 | Releases November 22</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-17-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1FRRJP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel (Set of 2)</a> -- $24.88</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Steering-Racing-Compatible-Nintendo-2/dp/B0F9WCMQGT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TNP Switch 2 Racing Wheel</a> -- $12</li></ul><hr><p>As mentioned above, these racing wheel accessories are compatible with racing games like Mario Kart World, adding a layer of immersion you wouldn't get by playing with the Joy Con 2 or other gamepad by itself. If you have yet to play Mario Kart World, you can grab the physical edition for $79. If you're still on the hunt for a Switch 2 console, you can also grab the digital edition of the game in a bundle with the Switch 2 via the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-World-Bundle-2/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;th=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Kart World bundle</a>, which is currently in stock and available for $499. Not that the bundle is a limited-time offer and is planned to be discontinued soon.</p><p>Several other racing games are available on Switch 2 that support gyro controls, including eShop titles like Arcade Archives 2: Aqua Jet, Fast Fusion, Star Wars: Episode I Racer, and more--not to mention all the racing games on the original Switch that are playable on Switch 2, like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3, and more. You could even use the Numbskull Joy-Con 2 Steering Wheel to control vehicles in Switch 2 games with motion control support like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F64Q8C97?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Star-Wars-Outlaws-Gold-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F79Z9V31?tag=gamespot-promoes-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: Outlaws Gold Edition</a>, and No Man's Sky: Switch 2 Edition.

                <p>Fantastic Pixel Castle, the NetEase-owned MMO studio founded by former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> lead system designer Greg Street, will shut down November 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Street announced the studio's closure date in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. In weeks prior, Street stated NetEase had pulled funding from the studio but had allowed it time to seek out a new publisher or raise funding for their fledgling MMORPG, project Ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">Those efforts have not panned out. Street said "there is still a chance" the studio could secure needed funding and live on, but that it will also depend on how much of the current team will choose to remain should that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle had recently hosted a number of content creators to stream a first public look at project Ghost gameplay. The game was still in its early stages, with Fantastic Pixel Castle having been fairly transparent about its development process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-lfbPENg3I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C-lfbPENg3I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The studio believed recent MMOs have put too much of a focus on solo adventuring and sought to emphasize playing with friends and building an online community, according to the studio's <a href="https://fantasticpixelcastle.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival game</a>, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0000712515/000162828025047811/ea-20250930.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new regulatory filing</a>, Electronic Arts outlined a number of the risks the company faces, and one of them is the company's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion sale</a> to a private investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF).</p><p>The Securities &amp; Exchange Commission requires companies to disclose risks to its business activity in <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/form10-q.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarterly 10-Q filings</a>. EA disclosed these as per usual, but a new risk this time around is specific to its pending sale to the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners.</p><p>Specific to the merger, EA said "uncertainty about the effect of the merger may impair our ability to attract, retain, and motivate key personnel, and could cause customers, suppliers, financial counterparties, and others to seek to change existing business relationships with us."</p><p>When the PIF emerged as the leading investor in the consortium to buy EA, one of the first reactions pertained to Saudi Arabia's history of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">human rights violations. </a> Some of the teams inside EA, including BioWare and Maxis, are known for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eas-55-billion-saudi-buyout-good-bad-ugly-rhys-elliott-p9lse/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics predicted</a> some staff will leave EA voluntarily due to Saudi Arabia's history with human rights issues. Already, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">a group of EA employees wrote a letter to jointly speak out against the proposed sale</a>, expressing a range of issues and concerns about it, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures. The $55 billion sale is the largest leveraged buyout (LBO) in history for any industry, and EA is on the hook for $20 billion. The company is expected to use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments, and many fear layoffs and closures could come as well.</p><p>EA's 10-Q filing does not mention humanitarian issues by name, instead referring only to more open-ended "uncertainty" pertaining to a possible negative effect of attracting, retaining, and hiring talent if the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity close the deal to buy EA.</p><h2><strong>EA claims it will retain "creative control"</strong></h2><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a> also noticed that <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA filed an updated Schedule 14A proxy statement</a> that discusses what impact a sale to the investor consortium could have on EA's culture. The document makes the claim that EA's "mission, values, and commitment to players and fans around the world" would be "unchanged."</p><p>The filing also states that the investor consortium is "supportive and committed to" investing in EA's employees and its "strong culture." Additionally, the document states that EA, not the investor consortium, will "maintain creative control" of the company going forward, adding that EA's "track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."</p><h2><strong>Other risks related to the merger</strong></h2><p>Some of the other "merger risks" that EA laid out in its filing included EA's possible inability to pursue other business deals that could be advantageous due to the $55 billion sale being underway. </p><p>EA also mentioned that it has already, and will continue to, incur "significant costs" and expenses for fees and professional services related to the pending buyout. If the deal doesn't close, EA would still be on the hook for these payments, and potentially up to $1 billion in a termination fee to the consortium.</p><p>What's more, EA said the deal could take longer than expected to close, it might face lawsuits from the board of directors about it, and public stockholders may raise concerns.</p><p>These risks are separate from the "strategic risks" that EA disclosed in the 10-Q as well. Some of these risks include EA deriving a "significant portion" of its revenue from a "few" franchises. EA mentioned the EA Sports FC series as an example here, saying the annual franchise brings in lots of money each year, and if something happened that would impact this--like a delay or cancellation, loss of a license, or bad reviews--that could be problematic. Another risk is an outside contracted developer failing to meet contractural expectations, or if a new console comes out and fails to find a big audience, EA said.</p><h2><strong>Hurricanes, earthquakes, and tariffs</strong></h2><p>There are a series of "operational risks" highlighted in the document as well, including natural disasters. EA noted that its corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California is near a fault line and some of its other offices, like in Los Angeles and Orlando, are "vulnerable to natural disasters and weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes." EA also noted that a major weather event could interrupt the power grid, which could negatively affect EA's ability to do business.</p><p>Additionally, EA called out US President Donald Trump's much-criticized tariff and immigration policies as possible risks to its business. "Relations between the United States and countries in which we have operations and sales have been impacted by events such as immigration policies and the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including tariffs and economic sanctions, that may have a material impact on our operations and financial results," EA said.</p><p>"For example, the imposition of tariffs by the U.S. government on imported goods and any retaliatory tariffs from foreign governments could result in increased costs and uncertainty that may negatively affect global economic conditions and activity and negatively affect our business and the businesses of our partners."</p><p>EA's sale to the investor consortium is expected to close in 2026. Some experts believe the deal may face a smoother regulatory process due in part to Affinity Partners boss Jared Kushner being the son-in-law of Trump.
