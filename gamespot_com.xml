Today, Pocketpair has announced another "compromise" via its next update, which will remove the ability to glide with a Pal--now, gliding will require a separate glider item.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Pocketpair account on X announced the coming update, and that the change was a direct result of continued legal proceedings with Nintendo.

You might not know him by name, but Hachiya is known for his ambitious products, like a flying machine inspired by the works of Miyazaki and his own take on a real version of the hoverboard from the movie Back to the Future.</p><p>Hachiya created the <a href="https://www.petworks.co.jp/user_contents/hachiya/works/OpenSky_Q&amp;A.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"OpenSky" project</a> that led to the creation of a motor glider based on the <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%B6we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mowe plane </a>from the Miyazaki anime <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>.

In addition to being a director at PetWorks, Hachiya is currently a professor of fine arts at Tokyo University of the Arts and the Director of the Art Media Center at Tokyo University of the Arts.</p><p>Hachiya is also known for developing the email app <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/19970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PostPet</a>. This software attempts to make corporate emailing more fun by having a little creature--a dancing pink bear named Momo is one of them--who lives in your computer personally deliver emails.</p><p><span>Nintendo will vote on whether or not to confirm Hachiya's appointment to the board during the company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 27, 2025.</span></p><p>This will happen not long after Nintendo releases the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on June 5.

Expedition 33 has a robust system for buildcrafting, and one of them turns the character Maelle into a weapon of mass destruction. It's primarily an endgame build that revolves around the Stendhal skill, and when done correctly, it's capable of eliminating enemies in a single blow.</p><p>In an update on its <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media channels</a>, Sandfall says that Stendhal was "underwhelming for most of development" and that it was boosted before Expedition 33 was released. "We still want you to be able to break the game--and you absolutely still can--but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy," Sandfall wrote.</p>

<p>The patch to adjust Stendhal's damage output will roll out to Steam first on May 9 before it lands on other platforms, and Sandfall added that it'll still be capable of one-shotting enemies, but it'll be "more in line" with other strategies and builds.</p><p>This build does require quite a bit of work up front before you can use it, as you'll need to acquire a specific weapon and several passive Pictos skills to maximize the damage output. It's not uncommon to smash through enemies who have health bars in the range of 50 million, and several players have managed to optimize the build to deal <em>billions</em> in damage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/">Even with the surprise launch of Oblivion Remastered</a> just days before it was scheduled to arrive, Expedition 33 continues to be one of the big hits of 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">The game has sold over 2 million copies</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it was also a day-one launch through Game Pass. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">The soundtrack is also performing exceptionally</a> well, as it reached No. 1 on Billboard's Classical Album charts, and it has been streamed over 18 million times since it went live.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/furi-demake-the-chain/" data-ref-id="5000-611591">Furi Demake</a>, an 8-bit mini game inspired by iconic 2016 action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/furi/" data-ref-id="5000-450300">Furi</a>, is about to become a paid game on Steam after over a year of being free. The developer explained that the move to a paid game will help the game increase its visibility, as well as test interest for potential expansion of the retro demake.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2593450/view/546734643204849716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam news update</a>, the team behind Furi Demake announced that fans would have until June 23 to grab the game for free, at which point it would become a paid game. "Unfortunately a free game can only enter a limited amount of fests or events on Steam," the update explained, saying that the demake hadn't been getting as much visibility as initially hoped. "Making it paid will allow us to register it in events, discount it, and make it visible to more people."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9nTiXyKGhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w9nTiXyKGhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this, making the game paid will be a way of testing demand for the retro-styled game, potentially allowing Furi Demake to expand to include other Furi bosses. At present, the demake only includes Furi's first boss fight, The Chain.</p><p>Furi is a fast-paced arcade-style action game by The Game Bakers that blends sword-fighting and shooting in a series of punishing boss battles. The studio teamed up with solo developer Sylph for the 8-bit demake, which reimagined the game's first boss fight, and released it for free as a "love letter to [Furi's] community."</p><p>Now, it looks like The Game Bakers want to do more with the retro proof-of-concept, but at least they've given fans plenty of warning before putting the price up. You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593450/Furi_Demake__The_Chain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furi Demake - The Chain for free on Steam</a> until June 23.</p>

                <p>The developer behind viral browser game One Million Checkboxes is back, and this time there's One Million Chessboards. The online browser game has no real rules or win states: It simply lets players loose on a playground--or battlefield--made up of a million chessboards.</p><p>The rules of <a href="https://onemillionchessboards.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One Million Chessboards</a> are simple: "Moving a piece moves it for everyone, instantly. There are no turns. You can move between boards." Other than that, players are free to do what they wish within the bounds given--whether that's capturing as many enemy pieces as possible, capturing as many enemy kings as possible, taking on another player in live combat, or just getting creative with it.</p><p>The game tracks a number of stats that add depth to how players may choose to engage with it--the total number of pieces remaining on the board for both black and white teams, and the total number of kings remaining for each team. You can also track your stats as an individual player by number of captures and number of moves made, and you can even find a nearby online player to engage in live battle by clicking the skull icon in the navigation panel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532" data-ratio="0.56241872561769" data-width="1538" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532"></a><figcaption>One Million Chessboards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg"></figure><p>Every piece on the board also tracks how many moves it's made, how many pieces its captured, and even collect special tags based on its activity. Extra-lethal pieces even pick up an icon that's visible to all players without the piece being selected.</p><p>The project comes from experimental developer Nolen Royalty, who also goes by Eieio. "I like putting games in surprising places and helping strangers interact on the internet," Nolen says of his work, and One Million Chessboards is the most ambitious manifestation of that ethos yet.</p><p>Nolen says the project is the "most technically challenging thing" he's worked on in some time, and <a href="https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-chessboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his website</a> gives a brief rundown of what's happening under the hood to keep its 1 million chessboards tracking.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has predicted how many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 consoles</a> it expects to sell during its 2026 financial year, which will cover the first 10 months of the hybrid gaming console when it hits the market on June 5. According to Nintendo's results for the full financial year that ended on March 31, it's forecasting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles and 45 million games.</p><p>This would put it close to the sales figures of the original Switch console, which launched in March 2017 and reached 17.79 million sales globally during its first 13 months. It's also worth noting that Nintendo is predicting that the Switch 2 will reach its sales goal in 10 months. There are other elements to consider as well--like the Switch 2 having a higher MSRP of $450 for the base model--but the company has factored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">US president Donald Trump's tariff</a> rates for its sales. In Japan, demand has outstripped supply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-scammers-are-convincing-people-they-won-the-nintendo-lottery-in-japan/1100-6531112/">Nintendo says preorders that side have exceeded its expectations</a>.</p>
