                <p>A new report suggests NHL players are increasingly turning to video games and weed edibles during their downtime, as opposed to boozing like players of past generations took part in regularly.</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078563/2025/01/24/nhl-weed-gummies-video-gaming-alcohol/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that because technology has advanced so much, it's very easy to "live a virtual life instead of a real one." Buffalo Sabres forward Peyton Krebs, 23, said, "We'll all go out for dinner, but then guys will generally go back to their rooms to play video games."</p><p>One anonymous defenseman told the site that playing video games with teammates can help with camaraderie. "You just have to be more open," this person said. "I'll try to drag guys out of their comfort zone, and then I'll play video games with them."</p><p>Beyond video games, NHL players appear to be increasingly turning to weed edibles over booze during downtime. The Athletic spoke with more than three-dozen current NHL players and asked if they took an edible during the season, and 38% "indicated" they did. Hockey players are known to be big boozers, but this trend may be on the decline. Floridan Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told the site he was told when he entered the NHL a decade ago, "If you can't play hungover in this league, you don't belong in it."</p><p>That attitude may be changing, especially with younger players. Schmidt said it's unacceptable for players to show up to practice at anything less than 100%. Alcohol-fueled partying during the season is on the decline, it seems, as players look to mellow out instead and take better care of their bodies.</p><p>A veteran NHL forward who asked to remain anonymous said he's sad about the lack of boozing as a means of team-bonding. "When I came into the league, we were going out for beers the night before games," he said. "I think (the NHL) used to be more fun back in the day."</p><p>Cannabis is not banned for NHL players, and it is legal in many cities across North America where NHL teams play.</p><p>As for EA's NHL video game series, the newest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-640627">NHL 25</a>, was just recently updated with a new 4 Nations Face-Off update themed around the real-world tournament.</p>

                <p>A regular library typically doesn't have a section devoted to out-of-print video game magazines and promotional materials, but that's a gap that the Video Game History Foundation is looking to fill next week when it opens the doors to its virtual library. The non-profit organization has been steadily collecting video game materials for several years, and its public library will be accessible starting January 30.</p><p>"After years of collecting, cataloging, and digitizing video game history materials, the VGHF is finally opening the virtual doors to its library--wherever you are," the group said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-video-game-history-foundation-makes-its-digital-library-available-to-the-public-next-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). Some of the materials teased by the organization include high-resolution scans of Final Fantasy 7 artwork and more than 1,500 video game magazines.</p><p>The VGHF added that its library will be home to "never-before-seen game development materials," and with powerful search options teased, it could become an invaluable resource for video game historians to make use of.</p><p>If you're interested in seeing more of the VGHF's work--and supporting its efforts to preserve the past--<a href="https://gamehistory.org/" rel="nofollow ">you can check out its main website for more details</a>. The group has faced a few obstacles in its video game preservation mission, as last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-preservation-efforts-just-got-some-bad-news-from-us-copyright-office/1100-6527411/">its petition to the US Copyright Office</a> to allow libraries to share out-of-print video games in their possession with researchers remotely was denied.</p><p>The VGHF is one of several preservation efforts that have sprung up over the years, with one of the other notable examples being GOG's program to keep classic video games compatible with current and next-gen systems. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-put-together-a-new-team-focused-on-game-preservation/1100-6522463/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-has-set-up-a-new-game-preservation-department/1100-6502798/">PlayStation</a> have also reportedly set up their own preservation programs for their game libraries.</p>

                <p>Circana has shared new video game data that shows how challenging 2024 was for video game hardware. Total spending on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch devices in the US declined a gargantuan 25%, dropping to $4.9 billion (down from $6.45 billion in 2023).</p><p>For December 2024 specifically, spending on new video game hardware fell 29%, declining to $1.1 billion. PS5 hardware sales in December 2024 dropped by 18%, with Xbox Series X|S and Switch sales each declining a more precipitous 38%.</p><p>A major drop in spending on video game hardware is expected, of course, given PS5 and Xbox Series X|S being past their prime selling peaks and the Switch's maturity in the market, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggacbcepk2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a>. That said, Piscatella commented that the decline was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgh33abqkc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bigger than he expected.</a></p><p>PS5 was December 2024's best-selling console platform in terms of units sales and dollars, with Switch coming in second place. For 2024 overall, PS5 led the way in unit and dollar sales, followed by Xbox Series X|S for dollar sales and Switch coming in at No. 2 for unit sales.</p><p>Also of note is that 49% of all PS5 consoles and 43% of Xbox Series X|S devices sold in December 2024 did not have a disc drive. For 2024 overall, all-digital consoles made up 45% of PS5 units sold and 44% of all Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Something else to know</a> is that, while the PS5 is pacing 7% ahead of the PS4 in terms of unit sales after its first 50 months on the market, Xbox Series X|S sales are down 18% compared to Xbox One.</p><p>Another key statistic was that PS5 is now the No. 3 best-selling console in US history of all time based on dollar sales, only behind Nintendo Switch and Xbox 360. PS5 is now the No. 11 best-selling console in US video game history based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo is launching the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025, and that should help improve hardware spending this year. Microsoft is said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">cooking up a new Xbox console <em>and </em>a new Xbox handheld device</a>, while Sony is rumored to be developing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6.</a></p><p>In terms of video game sales in 2024 in the US, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/" data-ref-id="2900-5106">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was the No. 1 best-selling game of the year. </a></p>
