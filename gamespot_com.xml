Hall Effect sticks typically feel smoother than regular analog sticks, too.</p><p>Unlike 8BitDo's flagship Ultimate Bluetooth Controller, the 2C, and C series in general, doesn't have back buttons. Instead, it comes with an extra pair of remappable shoulder bumpers. These inputs can be remapped on the fly, which is nice, but you don't get the other customization features found in the standard Ultimate, as it's not compatible with 8BitDo's mobile and desktop apps.</p><p>The Ultimate 2C does have built-in rumble, 6-axis motion controls, and a turbo button. It also has a "wake-on-shake" feature, so you can turn it back on with a slight jostle. Amazon's listing doesn't mention battery life, but the Ultimate C offered 16 hours of play between charges.</p><p>While we haven't tested the Ultimate 2C Bluetooth model yet, we have used the Ultimate C Bluetooth and the Ultimate 2C 2.4GHz Wireless. 8BitDo's C series of controllers offer great ergonomics, feel, and overall performance; we'd be surprised if the Ultimate 2C Bluetooth didn't follow that trend.</p><p>The original <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">C</a> apepars to be on its way out, but the pink model is available for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0CLM3T2LT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $24 (was $30) at Amazon</a>.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console\/dp\/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50 (was $60) | $53 with carrying case</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Deals - Switch, PC, Mac, Mobile, Steam Deck</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Compatible-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DFGZL87S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller + Carrying Case</a> -- $53 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller (White)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BGJVLL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller (Black)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><p><strong>8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Controller Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Works with Switch, PC, Mac, Mobile, Steam Deck</li><li>Available in white and black</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks</li><li>Two remappable back triggers</li><li>Connects wirelessly with Bluetooth or 2.4GHz</li><li>Optional USB-C wired mode</li><li>Up to 22 hours battery life</li><li>Includes matching charging dock</li><li>Support for 8BitDo Ultimate Software customizations:  <ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Three custom profiles</li><li>Custom macros</li><li>Analog stick dead zones</li><li>Adjustable stick and trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjustable rumble intensity</li></ul></li></ul><p>The Ultimate 2C is 8BitDo's budget Switch controller, but the flagship Ultimate Bluetooth Controller is by no means expensive.

                <p>Cris Tales developer We Are Dreams has released a gameplay trailer for its next game, Prisma. The game's art direction is heavily inspired by Persona 5 but has plenty of mechanics to help make it stand out.</p><p>Prisma follows a photojournalist named Alma who finds a magical camera that transfers her to another world called Domacon, filled with other Almas from the multiverse. Friend, foe, or NPC, each Alma has a Prism Shard that grants them magical abilities in battle, and rival Almas will try to steal them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Lyhho-Vj78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Lyhho-Vj78" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's turn-based combat is inspired by Persona 5 as well, but has some key differences. Players are able to use Alma's camera filters to distort reality and apply buffs to the entire party of alternate Almas, such as using a fisheye lens to bypass enemy shields or a shattered lens to turn a single-target attack into a multi-target one.</p><p>Alma will also be able to interact and form bonds with the other versions of herself in the party, which unlocks new combos and side quests. There will be seven different Almas to bond with, although a max of four will be allowed per run.</p><p>Prisma is set to launch for PC. We Are Dreams is best known for the RPG Cris Tales back in 2021. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cris-tales-review/1900-6417700/" data-ref-id="1900-6417700">Cris Tales review</a>, we said, "Though it doesn't quite stick the landing, Cris Tales is an enjoyable turn-based RPG adventure with a lovable story about a found family bending time to save the world."</p>

Surprisingly, Bungie's letting them keep it.</p><p dir="ltr">Players quickly noticed the upgrade was appearing in Destiny 2's in-game shop for free, with some even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1o78LwoKz0">making videos and posts</a> to spread the word about the free loot. Bungie <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866546497816498432" rel="nofollow ">quickly responded</a> by disabling the upgrade, which had the unfortunate side-effect of also putting all Dawning 2024 Event Card Triumphs and related progression on hold.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866556391109837143" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Due to disabling the Dawning Event Card, all Event Card Triumphs and progression are on hold until the main issue is resolved.<br>We'll provide updates once we have more information.</p>  — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866556391109837143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">Naturally, some players grew frustrated that their Dawning progress had been halted, while others were more upset about the fact that their ill-begotten gains might not be sticking around. After all, Bungie had said that once the issue was resolved, "players will need to re-acquire the Dawning Event Card Upgrade for 1,000 Silver."</p><p dir="ltr">But for some reason, it seems Bungie has had a change of heart. Shortly after Bungie announced that Dawning Event Card progression was halted and players would need to repurchase the upgrade, a new announcement was shared, letting players know that the underlying issue causing the bug had been fixed. Additionally, players who got their hands on the upgrade while it was free will be allowed to keep it.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866595301613769151" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">UPDATE: We have identified the underlying issue impacting the price of the Dawning Event Card Upgrade.<br>At this time, we are planning the following actions:<br>1. Players who obtained the Dawning Event Card Upgrade while it was incorrectly listed at no cost will keep it. Bank error…</p>  — Destiny 2 Team (@Destiny2Team) <a href="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866595301613769151?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The reason behind Bungie's change in direction seems to be the season. After all, The Dawning's in-game description reads, "Collect ingredients, bake treats, and exchange gifts to celebrate the season."</p><p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1866621969082486841" rel="nofollow ">fourth tweet</a>, the developer told players to stay tuned, as an update regarding the Dawning Card debacle is planned for the near future.</p>

                <p>The Sorceress is one of the six classes available to players in the early access build of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>. While it may not be the strongest class, you can turn the Sorceress into a boss-killing machine with the right skills and playstyle. Below, we've put together all the recommended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill</a> and Support Gems, Passives, and Ascendancy you should use with the Sorceress, as well as a brief overview of the class.</p><h2>Sorceress Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As a Sorceress, you can wield a few different weapons that give you access to a variety of different spells. These spells can be slotted into your binds without having to spend an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Uncut Skill Gem</a> on them. Sorceresses can use wands, staffs, and sceptres. Wands and staffs usually give you an elemental spell to use, while the sceptres often grant you the ability to utilize minions on the battlefield. Your choice of staff is actually quite important, as the associated spell with your gear plays a part in the build you make.</p><p>Sorceresses have access to three types of elemental damage: frost, lightning, and fire. You can still use minions and elemental damage spells at the same time, but you'll usually want to synergize your main weapon's spell with your other Skill Gems. However, there are some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> for the Sorceress that utilize forms of minions as well, such as Raging Spirits. This Spirit Gem sends out three fire skulls that deal damage to enemies for you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250"></a><figcaption>The available Skill Gems for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png"></figure><p>As you might expect, the Sorceress class is mainly based on the Intelligence attribute. Almost all your gear will require a high Intelligence stat but you'll find Dexterity is also an attribute you want to invest at least a few points into. Raising Dexterity helps with the accuracy of your spells, and you need some points to equip certain pieces of gear.</p><p>Speaking of gear, your Sorceress will likely be decked out in lighter armor with modifiers that boost Intelligence, give you extra mana, and increase whatever type of elemental damage you've chosen to wield. The lighter armor adds to the notion that the Sorceress is a "glass cannon," meaning it has terrific offensive abilities but not-so-great defensive stats. You can always wield gear with higher armor or dump some points into the Strength attribute if you feel you're dying too much, but our build should take care of those concerns.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>For the most part, the best Sorceress build utilizes frost damage to deal with enemies and bosses alike. While lightning and fire skills can be used in conjunction with frost damage, you'll mostly be relying on your freezing spells to kill opponents. The skills you use will slot in right next to the preferred staff of choice, which is the <strong>Gelid Staff</strong>. This staff gives you access to the Freezing Shards spell, which goes nicely with all of the other frost skills you'll be using.</p><p>During the early game as a Sorceress, you won't have access to too many frost skills, with the best option being Ice Nova for close-range damage. However, as you progress, particularly into the Level 9 Skill Gems, you'll start to build a solid lineup of frost spells to use.</p><p>One non-frost skill you want to utilize, especially during the early game, is <strong>Ember Fusillade</strong>. This is a stacking, fire spell that can be used to clear tons of enemies at once and deal massive damage to bosses. It doesn't quite fit in the frost Sorceress build, but it's a skill you'll want to use before gaining access to your better frost skills.</p><p>Below, you can see what skills we recommend for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Flame Wall</li><li>Ice Nova</li><li>Ember Fusillade</li><li>Frostbolt</li><li>Cold Snap</li><li>Frost Wall</li><li>Flameblast</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251"></a><figcaption>Ice Nova is a powerful early-game skill.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png"></figure><p>As you can see, there's a solid mix of fire and frost spells here. However, the fire skills mainly come in the early game, where they're a tad stronger than the alternative frost skills you have access to. Flame Wall and Ember Fusillade are terrific for dealing damage en masse while Ice Nova can get you out of jams with enemies that like to get a little too close.</p><p>In the teen levels of your Sorceress, you'll start to unlock better frost skills like Frostbolt, Cold Snap, and Frost Wall. All of these skills will drive you to the end of Act 3 on normal difficulty in Path of Exile 2. Then, during your journey in the Cruel difficulty acts, you'll unlock Flameblast, which is a huge fire skill that can only be used sparingly unless you want to run out of mana quickly.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>With your skills in place, it's time to kit them out with Support Gems to increase their stats and find some Spirit Gems to slot in alongside them.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Spell Cascade (Flame/Frost Wall)</li><li>Ignition (Ember Fusillade)</li><li>Scattershot (Frostbolt)</li><li>Glaciation (Frostbolt)</li><li>Magnified Effect (Flame Wall)</li><li>Icicle (Frost Wall)</li><li>Spell Echo (Cast on Freeze)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Cast on Freeze</li><li>Raging Spirits</li><li>Blink</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252"></a><figcaption>Choosing the Raging Spirits Spirit Gem</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Passive Skills</h2><p>There are a few different ways you can go with your Passive Ability skill tree as a Sorceress. You can choose to lean into the "glass cannon" build and go for offensive stats that help you freeze enemies better or give you increased attack power. However, if you find yourself dying more often than you'd like, it's probably wiser to choose defensive buffs that improve evasion rating, armor, and energy shield regeneration.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Path of Winter</li><li>Climate Change</li><li>Echoing Frost</li><li>Raw Power</li><li>Open Mind</li><li>Exploit the Elements</li><li>Shattering</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253"></a><figcaption>The Passive skill tree for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Ascendancy</h2><p>Finally, after you've leveled up your Sorceress enough, you'll get to choose an Ascendancy for it in Path of Exile 2. The two options you have are <strong>Chronomancer and Stormweaver</strong>.</p><p>Our choice for an Ascendancy is going to Chronomancer. While Stormweaver is slightly better offensively, we decided it was best to give you extra defensive help so you can stay alive longer during fights. The Chronomancer Ascendancy has access to a buff called "Time Freeze," which allows you to pause time briefly and get away from a sticky situation.</p><p>However, if you're all about offense and dealing damage, then Stormweaver should be your pick. You can utilize abilities such as Heart of the Storm, Arcane Surge, and Elemental Storm, all of which help you deal damage in some way.</p><p>That does it for our Sorceress build in Path of Exile 2. If you're looking to run another class, we recommend the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-monk-build-guide/1100-6528322/" data-ref-id="1100-6528322">Monk</a>, which has a spectacular and balanced build.</p>
