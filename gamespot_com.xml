                <p>The popular AI VTuber Neuro-Sama is attempting to complete<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990"> Minecraft</a> Hardcore, and her human supervisors appear to be losing all hope following a series of comedic but disappointing failures on her part.</p><p>Neuro is an AI-powered VTuber created by streamer <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>, and she utilizes a large language model with rapid response times, and the ability to "see" screens, read her own Twitch chat, respond to speech in almost real time, and even play games. Now, she's attempting Minecraft's Hardcore mode--the permadeath version of Minecraft that wipes the game world as soon as one player dies. Vedal, along with fellow VTubers<a href="https://twitch.tv/crelly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Crelly </a>and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/filian" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Filian</a>, has claimed that the Twitch stream will not end until the quartet complete the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcE_dHvaN2Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZcE_dHvaN2Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To complete Minecraft, the four need to get to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-to-the-end-in-minecraft/1100-6531635/" data-ref-id="1100-6531635">The End</a> to face off against the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-ender-dragon-boss-guide-where-to-find-and-how-to-beat/1100-6531625/" data-ref-id="1100-6531625"> Ender Dragon</a>--not an easy feat at the best of times, and certainly not when you're relying on a childlike AI to make the right decisions, follow instructions, and cheat death.</p><p>As if that didn't sound complex enough, Neuro has been making some interesting choices that have resulted in yet another world reset. Neuro often gets overwhelmed with bloodlust, seeking out mobs during the night and facing off against them with less than ideal strategies. She's not yet mastered the "hit and shield" approach of attacking mobs, so she'll repeatedly land weak attacks on them until they inevitably overcome her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQNHxSGrVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UcQNHxSGrVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Alongside the usual Minecraft deaths--such as being blown up by Creepers, attacked by an Enderman, or falling into a lava pit--Neuro has seemingly decided to troll her creator and his friends. Clad entirely in enchanted diamond armor, the four set off for the Nether to find Blaze Rods--an ingredient essential for finding the portal to The End--where Neuro immediately began to build a bridge over a large lava lake. After taking an extended look back at the portal to the overworld, she spammed crouch and then walked off the end of the bridge and burned to death.</p><p>On another attempt, after becoming overwhelmed by that aforementioned bloodlust, Neuro slayed an innocent Villager. In Minecraft, if you damage a Villager in a village protected by an Iron Golem, that Golem will not take kindly to your actions. Neuro found this out the hard way, and in just two hits she was dead, and the run was over.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xPyoaBEc5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4xPyoaBEc5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As the attempts progress, Crelly--who has become Neuro's "stepmother" and often entrusted with babysitting the AI--is becoming increasingly frustrated with Neuro's frequent mistakes. "She wants to die!" yelled the cow YouTuber after attempt number 74. "Neuro, Neuro, Neuro!" she shouts during attempt 80, when Neuro-Sama insisted upon digging upwards out of a safe area Crelly had created for her. "Neuro, that's an Enderman; let's not look at him. Follow me!" she adds. It's safe to say the trust in Neuro's Minecraft capabilities is rapidly depleting.</p><p>At the time of writing, the streamers are taking a sleep break after attempt number 83, and the stream has been live since Friday, December 5, at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM GMT. According to YouTube editor <a href="https://youtu.be/4xPyoaBEc5k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KeidenEdits</a>, Neuro has been responsible for 47 deaths, Filian for 14 deaths, Vedal for 13 deaths, and Crelly for 10 deaths. Of those statistics, 17 have been Zombies, 11 have been Creepers, and 11 have been Skeletons. Nine deaths have resulted from fall damage, eight from drowning, four from the Iron Golem, four from lava, Neuro has turned homicidal four times, the Drowned mob has committed two murders, two from Zombified Piglins, two from an Enderman, and one a piece for the Witch, Spider, Husk, and Guardian mobs. Neuro has starved to death once, Vedal has accidentally killed once, and Neuro has suffocated in sand once.</p><p>The four plan to resume their attempts today, December 8, at 8:30 AM PT / 11:30 AM ET / 4:30 PM GMT.</p>

                <p>There are well over 200 individual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> seeds you can plant in your plot of land in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>. Each one has a different rarity and value, and depending on the type of plant, they can either be harvested once or will keep growing new fruits indefinitely after you sell the ones you pick. However, with such a high turnaround for events and their exclusive seeds, you may wonder if there is another way to get them.</p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, with recent changes to the game’s structure, there is now a way to get some older plants that were available during the Spring and Summer. Of course, once you get the high-value plants, you’ll want to have them grow, then expose them to as many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/">Grow A Garden weather events</a> as possible to increase their value with multipliers added to them via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-grow-a-garden-mutations/1100-6534388/">Grow A Garden mutations</a>. Here are all the ways you can get your hands on Grow A Garden seeds and seed packs, including those you can only find during events.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_Seeds">How to get Grow A Garden Seeds</a><ul><li><a href="#How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</a><ul><li><a href="#Craftable_Seeds">Craftable Seeds</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#All_Grow_A_Garden_Seed_Packs">All Grow A Garden Seed Packs</a></li></ul></div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601032" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601032"></a><figcaption>The Seed Shop has a wide variety of seeds you can purchase, though its stock is widely variable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601032-grow-a-garden-seeds.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_Seeds">How to get Grow A Garden Seeds</h2><p dir="ltr">The first way to get Grow A Garden seeds is to buy them from the Seed Shop. The catch is that there are varying odds on which plants will be available whenever the shop restocks, with the more common seeds restocking more often than those of higher rarity. As such, Transcendent rarity plants, such as Crimson Thorns, will seldom ever see a natural restock.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are following the directions in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/">Grow A Garden beginner’s guide</a>, you should try to get Mythical or higher rarity plants to start with, as they’ll give you a good return for your investment. Then it’s a case of getting as many multipliers as possible on them, which many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-pets-tier-list/2900-7008/">best Grow A Garden pets</a> can help you with.</p><p dir="ltr">While the shop used to have tiered stocks dependent on the friendship level with the store owner, Sam, there is now a new Daily Deals tab in its place. This now stocks previously available plants from older updates, which you can buy for a limited time. While they don’t restock on their own, you can spend some Robux to automatically refresh these Daily Deals if you find a plant you want more of. The varieties will change constantly, but have so far included Cauliflower, Brussels Sprout, Green Apple, Avocado, Rafflesia, Banana, and Pineapple, among many others.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_Grow_A_Garden_seed_packs">How to get Grow A Garden seed packs</h3><p dir="ltr">Seed packs are another way to get rarer seeds, though which one is up to chance. When you open it, you’ll see a roulette wheel that eventually lands on the seed you’ll get from the pack. Rarer seeds tend to have lower odds.</p><p dir="ltr">You can reliably get some seed packs via the in-game achievements section. Head into the Guide and select the Achievements tab to look at the first segment and find out what you need to do to obtain these packs.</p><p dir="ltr">Another way you can obtain seed packs is to complete the Daily Quests found in the Season Pass tab, which will earn you XP towards progressing to the next level. Rewards include the Prime Seed pack, which you can also buy from the Pass Store tab for 100 Pass Coins whenever they’re in stock.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, there are exclusive seeds and seed packs tied to the current event. You can find out all about how each event works in the central hub area by speaking to the NPCs, and we also have all the info about both the current and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/">next Grow A Garden event</a>. Sometimes they’re available in shops for Sheckles or in-theme currency (such as Candy Corn for the Halloween Market), while other times they’re drops in Chests. These work just like seed packs in almost every way, but can also include rare pets.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600997"></a><figcaption>The one place that will always have seeds is the Seed Shop, but it only replenishes some of its stock at any given time.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4600997-grow-a-garden-seeds-shop.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="All_Grow_A_Garden_seeds_you_can_buy">All Grow A Garden seeds you can buy</h2><p dir="ltr">To keep things simple, we will only update this list with the currently available Seeds in the shop at all times. Plenty more have been previously available as part of event shops, including one or two limited-time seeds, but these are tied to their subsequent events. We’ll also omit any Daily Deals seeds as the range changes constantly. It’s better to look for yourself which ones are on offer. Season Pass plants and craftables will be documented here as they’re available for a lot longer.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Seed Name</th><th scope="col">Seed

                <p>Which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grow-a-garden/">Grow A Garden</a> fruits are of the prickly type? Each one of the hundreds of available plants has a type associated with it. Blueberries are, well, berries, while the invaluable early-to–mid game Bamboo plants are classified as woody. One of the more uncommon types is the prickly plants, and that’s an issue if you’re trying to turn in plants for a limited-time reward.</p><p>Another thing you should be aware of is that fruits can have multiple types at once. For example, though the Rose is classified as a prickly fruit in this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-roblox-games/2900-6830/" data-ref-id="2900-6830">Roblox game</a>, it’s also both a flower and a leafy-type plant. Cultivating crops with multiple types can be beneficial in the long run when handling requests during upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-grow-a-garden-update-and-events/1100-6534922/" data-ref-id="1100-6534922">Grow A Garden updates</a>. So, to know which Grow A Garden seeds you should plant in your plot to get prickly plants, here is a list of all the currently included plants of this elusive type.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4601052"></a><figcaption>The in-game guide has all the Prickly plants listed in order of rarity if you type it in the search bar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1861/18616975/4601052-grow-a-garden-prickly-fruits-list.jpg"></figure><h2>Grow A Garden Prickly Fruits List</h2><p>There are currently 25 Grow A Garden prickly fruits to find in the game. However, only a handful of them are obtainable right now. This is because many of these were available in exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-seeds-packs/1100-6536143/" data-ref-id="1100-6536143">Grow a Garden seed packs</a> during events earlier in the game’s lifespan. Some have made comebacks via the Daily Deals shop, but many others have not at the time of writing.</p><p>That said, as mentioned in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grow-a-garden-beginners-guide-and-tips/1100-6535055/" data-ref-id="1100-6535055">Grow A Garden Beginner’s Guide</a>, there are valuable plants you can easily get from the regular seed shop, including two prickly plants that can be worth a lot during the early game. We recommend you try growing the crops with the highest Price-Floor Value so you can expose them to as many of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grow-a-garden-weather-events/2900-7058/" data-ref-id="2900-7058">Grow A Garden weather</a> conditions as possible.

                <p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada has announced that he'll be departing from the fighting game series and its publisher Bandai Namco at the end of 2025. Harada--who has worked on every Tekken game since the series first debuted in 1994--said in a social media post that the death of close friends in his life had led to him to consider how much time he had left as a creator, and after consulting PlayStation icon Ken Kutaragi, he decided to leave the publisher after spending 30 years working on the Tekken franchise.</p><p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary--an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to--I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close," Harada wrote in an online post. "In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi--whom I respect as though he were another father--and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I’d like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025.<br>With the TEKKEN series reaching its 30th anniversary—an important milestone for a project I’ve devoted much of my life to—I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close.<br>My roots lie…</p>  — Katsuhiro Harada (@Harada_TEKKEN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1997952347709034747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Harada added that he'd been gradually preparing the Tekken team for his departure, and he was grateful to have worked on the series and on several other games, such as Pokken Tournament and SoulCalibur. While Harada is leaving Bandai Namco, he mentioned he would share his next steps at a later date. In a separate post, Bandai Namco said it remains committed to future development and content for Tekken 8 and expressed gratitude to Harada for his decades of work.</p><p>Despite a strong launch and 3 million sales in its first year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-8-negativity-can-seem-bigger-than-it-is-dev-says/1100-6533921/" data-ref-id="1100-6533921">Tekken 8 has faced an uphill struggle throughout 2025</a>. Longtime fans have received recent gameplay updates, and character changes have been poorly received. Many players have also criticized the game's microtransaction system.</p>
