                <p>For the Arc Raiders Turnabout quest, Celeste has asked you to visit the North Trench Tower in Spaceport and upload some blackmail files. It sounds like risky business, but that's par for the course in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. In this guide, we'll fill you in on what you need to know about the Turnabout quest and how to complete it.</p><p>Note that when you accept this quest, Celeste will provide you with one Spaceport Trench Tower Key. <strong>This key must be in your inventory during the raid to complete this quest</strong>. Since you'll be heading to a quest area that may be populated with other raiders, it's probably best to <strong>toss your Spaceport Trench Tower Key in a safe pocket</strong>.</p><p><strong>If you lose the Spaceport Trench Tower Key, you'll be unable to complete the quest until you obtain another</strong>. As with nearly all keys in Arc Raiders, the drop rate is fairly low and random--though many players seem to have their best luck finding keys in residential areas. If you've lost your key, we're wishing you luck on finding a new one soon, raider.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Turnabout, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the North Trench Tower and upload the blackmail files</h2><p>The North Trench Tower is located at the very northern tip of the Spaceport map. It's often populated by other raiders looking to complete the quest--or steal your loot--so be mindful when approaching this spot. It's not uncommon for a Bastion to roam below the POI as well, or for Rocketeers to patrol the skies. In other words, it's not the safest location and should be approached with caution.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600474" data-ratio="0.55991840897501" data-width="1961" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600474"></a><figcaption>North Trench Tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600474-share_20251111_0525471.jpeg"></figure><p>As long as you have the Spaceport Trench Tower Key in your possession when you arrive, you can head up the stairs on either side of the building at the North Trench Tower and unlock the door.</p><p><strong>Be certain you're at the North Trench Tower before using the key, as the Spaceport Trench Tower Key can also open the South Trench Tower, which could waste your key!</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600475"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600475-share_20251111_0525472.jpeg"></figure><p>Immediately after unlocking and entering the door, head up the stairs on your left or right (depending on whether you unlocked the left or right North Trench Door). In the room above, <strong>you'll find a glowing yellow terminal you can interact with to upload the blackmail files to Celeste</strong>, which completes your quest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600771"></a><figcaption>Upload the blackmail files at this terminal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600771-share_20251111_0643520.jpeg"></figure><p>With Turnabout complete, you can now extract whenever you'd like--perhaps most easily at the Central Elevator. While you're at the North Trench Tower, however, you should definitely go ahead and loot everything you can find within. It's a great spot for loot and worth returning to if you get another Spacesport Trench Tower Key in the future.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s Simpsons season, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/" data-ref-id="2900-7205">took over Battle Royale</a> last week with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-simpsons-map-full-springfield-map-and-all-named-locations/2900-7204/" data-ref-id="2900-7204">new Springfield-themed island map</a>, got a welcome injection of new cartoonish weapons you can wield against your enemies in this week's update. The loot pool now includes Bart's Slingshot, which leaves a poison cloud where it lands, Moe's 5 Gun, which is five guns in one, and the Deodorant Applicator, which is a mid-range laser gun.</p><p>When Fortnite's Simpsons season began, it had a very noticeable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-simpsons-season/2900-7206/" data-ref-id="2900-7206">lack of Simpsons-themed weapons</a>. The loot pool had tons of Simpsons healing items, like Krusty Burgers and Super Squishees, but the weapons were all old Fortnite guns aside from the Mr. Blasty revolver.</p><p>But that changed in a big way in Week 2. Now there are four Simpsons weapons instead of one, including a rare combo gun with Moe's 5 Gun. That one is more or less a new version of the Pump and Dump, which was a shotgun and SMG that you could dual-wield during Chapter 6 Season 2. The Slingshot and Deodorant Applicator, meanwhile, both have unlimited ammo, but they have a durability stat that wears down as you use them.</p><p>These new weapons aren't the only major change Epic added this week. The Springfield map is now experiencing Donut Storms randomly during matches--these storms rain giant donuts from the sky that destroy buildings and do plenty of damage to any players who get in their way. That's pretty wild, and we're only in Week 2. There are still two more weeks of major changes expected.</p>

It's easily identified by a green sign above the door that reads "Farmacia." However, this door is locked and will need to be breached, which could alert nearby ARC or other raiders, so approach the situation carefully and keep an eye out for trouble.</p><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600482-share_20251111_0521162.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600483-share_20251111_0521151.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4600482,1300-4600483" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4600482-share_20251111_0521162.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/679/6794662/4600483-share_20251111_0521151.jpeg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600482-share_20251111_0521162.jpeg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4600483-share_20251111_0521151.jpeg"></figure><p>When you pop the door open, head inside and close it behind you.

This trend continues with Reduced to Rubble, which begins with asking you to do the simplest thing you've done in the game so far: take a photo. Hey, sounds easy enough, right? Let's find out.</p><p>Luckily, you won't need to extract to complete Reduced to Rubble, so you should bring in a free loadout if you're not familiar with the Blue Gate map or feel a bit nervous about losing any of your good loot. With the above-average amount of ARC roaming about on this map, things can go bad in the blink of an eye, so it's better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>When you're ready to complete Reduced to Rubble, here's how to make it so.</p><h2>Where to take a photo of the collapsed highway</h2><p>To find the collapsed highway, you'll need to head to the southern region of the Blue Gate map.

                <p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida has suggested that it was the original PlayStation that brought us From Software as a developer and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Bloodborne</a> as a game.</p><p>Speaking to Simon Parkin on <a href="https://shows.acast.com/my-perfect-console?utm_source=Social+Media&amp;utm_medium=Social+Post&amp;utm_campaign=MPC+Acast+Page" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the latest episode of his My Perfect Console podcast</a>, Yoshida said the industry's jump from cartridges to CDs enticed From Software to transition from a business software company to a game software company. As Yoshida recalled, Sony, a newer entrant in the console-making business, was attempting to court the likes of Atlus and Namco to bring their games to the OG PlayStation system. Cartridges were expensive and small in data capacity. CDs, Yoshida said, were much cheaper, quicker to manufacture, and capable of storing larger sets of data. From Software thus saw an opportunity to try something new.</p>

      </div>
<p>"They didn't have to wait for two or three months to restock their games," Yoshida said. "If the game is successful, the CD-ROM can be delivered [within] three or four days. So one of these companies was From Software. From Software was a business software company. But when they saw a CD-ROM game system like PlayStation, they [said], 'Oh, we can become a video game publisher.' So that's how they invested, they entered into the video game industry.”</p><p>Parkin interjected to say that we then got Bloodborne "eventually." Yoshida agreed, stating that "eventually," yes, this all led to the masterpiece that is Bloodborne.</p><p>However, Yoshida wasn't shy about the games that paved the way for Bloodborne to come into existence. He said it wasn't easy to convince companies like Atlus to take a chance on the fledgling PlayStation console, but the CD's powerful 3D capabilities did all the talking.</p><p>"The industry people were saying that between PlayStation and Sega Saturn, probably Sega Saturn will become more popular because of Sega's experience," Yoshida said. "However, it was a combination of the 3D graphics capability of PlayStation and the CD-ROM's new business opportunity. Of course, the Sega Saturn offered the same kind of opportunity in terms of CD-ROM. However, Namco provided a really good library of 3D games, starting with Ridge Racer. But other companies, like Capcom, came up with Resident Evil, and eventually, you know, Squaresoft released Final Fantasy VII. That was the most critical title."</p><p>Yoshida explained that producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, who wanted to create cinematic experiences, grew frustrated with Nintendo for sticking with cartridges between the SNES and Nintendo 64 generations. This helped Sony convince Squaresoft to bring Final Fantasy VII to PlayStation, which Parkin noted was originally planned for the SNES or N64. However, Sakaguchi and other Squaresoft folks saw an opportunity with CDs.</p><p>“The combination of, from a creative standpoint, Sakaguchi-san wanted a cinema movie like Final Fantasy," Yoshida said. "And also, from a business standpoint, they saw the attractiveness of the CD-ROM medium. And between Sega and Sony, I don't know how they decided, but we had a really good schmoozer, my boss from Sony Music Entertainment Company."</p><p>When asked about his reaction to acquiring Final Fantasy VII on PlayStation, Yoshida said it was "amazing." He couldn't remember Nintendo's response but noted that the company "must've been pissed."</p><p>This is all well and good, but unfortunately, Bloodborne doesn't appear to be making a comeback anytime soon. According to industry insider Jeff Grubb, a PC port of the Lovecraftian-RPG--or a remake or remaster or anything pertaining to Bloodborne--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bloodborne-could-be-on-ice-for-a-long-time-report/1100-6534886/" data-ref-id="1100-6534886">has made zero progress</a>. Anything is possible, of course, but for right now, we'll have to wait with bated breath to see if From Software brings the cult favorite back from the PS4 grave, as Yoshida <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">theorized in January 2025 that creator Hidetaka Miyazaki may be too busy</a> to focus his attention there.</p><p>From Software is hard at work on a Nintendo Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-for-switch-2-delayed-to-2026-due-to-performance-adjustments/1100-6535648/" data-ref-id="1100-6535648">which was delayed to 2026 for additional polish</a>) and the Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-duskbloods/" data-ref-id="5000-671285">The Duskbloods</a>.
