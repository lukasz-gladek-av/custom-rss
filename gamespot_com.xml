                <p>Bethesda and MachineGames have announced that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will launch for PS5 on April 17. They also released a new trailer featuring voice actors Troy Baker and Nolan North opening up a box containing a glowing blue hue, referring to PlayStation's primary color.</p><p>Those who preorder the game will receive the Last Crusade pack, which includes a Traveling Suit outfit for Indy as well as a Lion Tamer whip. The Premium Edition comes with a digital artbook and a Temple of Doom outfit, as well as a copy of the game in either digital or physical formats. It also includes up to two days of early access and the upcoming The Order of the Giants story DLC.</p><p>The Collector's Bundle is available too. It contains the Premium Edition, a steelbook case, an adventure journal, an Allmaker replica, and a globe with hidden storage.</p><p>Earlier this month, an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circles-esrb-rating-for-ps5-may-imply-launch-is-near/1100-6530005/" data-ref-id="1100-6530005">ESRB rating</a> for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle popped up, indicating that a release date could possibly be revealed soon. The game also racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-whips-up-4-million-players-before-ps5-debut/1100-6529145/" data-ref-id="1100-6529145">four million players on Xbox and PC</a> since its debut back in December before the PS5 release.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has won several awards, including Outstanding Achievement in Character, Outstanding Achievement in Story, and Adventure Game of the Year at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 Dice Awards</a>. It also won the Best Acting award for Troy Baker's performance as Indy at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>, we said, "Indiana Jones and The Great Circle takes an unexpectedly stealthy and freeform approach, making for a faithful, rip-roaring adventure in which you truly embody the famous archeologist."</p><p>The next Bethesda game that could be making its way over to PS5 is Starfield, as it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-still-not-confirmed-but-new-evidence-emerges/1100-6530141/" data-ref-id="1100-6530141">recently discovered</a> that the Bethesda Creation Kit website for the game was updated with the PlayStation logo.</p>

First announced in 2019 and last seen in 2022, Silksong fans are starved for more information--and a recent change to the game's SteamDB profile is providing a temporary snack.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/history/" rel="nofollow ">Silksong SteamDB</a> page is now reflecting a change made to the game's Steam metadata made on March 24. Specifically, the game's bio now includes an opt-in option for the Nvidia GeForce Now service--and, more importantly, a change in the store page's fine print that changes the copyright date from 2019 to 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4464116-hollow-knight-silksong-metadata.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464116" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4464116-hollow-knight-silksong-metadata.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4464116"></a><figcaption>Hornet from Hollow Knight Silksong</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4464116-hollow-knight-silksong-metadata.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The change has resurrected hopes of a Silksong appearance at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct livestream scheduled for April 2, as rumors swirled of the game's involvement with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-creator-drops-clues-of-switch-2-version/1100-6528880/">Switch 2 announcement</a> back in January.

                <p>Minecraft is one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#10" data-ref-id="2900-4814">most successful video games ever</a>, but no one should expect Mojang to release a "Minecraft 2" anytime soon, or ever. Ingela Garneij, executive producer on Minecraft Vanilla, was asked recently if the company could ever come out with a straight-up sequel.</p><p>Garneij responded to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mojang-rules-out-minecraft-2-do-you-think-were-going-to-have-an-earth-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>: "Do you think we're going to have an Earth 2? No, no, there's no Minecraft 2."</p><p>This response is no surprise at all, as Mojang and Microsoft have said for years that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/" data-ref-id="1100-6429533">there will not be a Minecraft 2</a>, at least not soon. Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson previously said, "I can't promise forever there'll never be a Minecraft 2, but for the foreseeable future there won't be."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5zcZJcXRdw0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Xbox higher-up Matt Booty, meanwhile, said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/" data-ref-id="1100-6429533">sees Minecraft instead as a platform that gets updated over time</a> as opposed to being replaced by a numbered sequel.</p><p>That's also what Garneij said when asked about the future of Minecraft. "We've existed for 15 years. We want to exist at least 15 years more so we actually, Agnes [Larsson, Minecraft Vanilla's game director] and I, we work as a team. We set the vision and strategy for our game for what can we do beyond that," Garneij said.</p><p>Garneij did admit, however, that Minecraft's aging technology base "slows us down" when it comes to development. "So other new games have new engines, and they can run really fast. So I would say the technology and our age [are our biggest challenges]," they said.</p><p>As part of the Minecraft Live event this past weekend, Mojang announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecrafts-vibrant-visuals-update-is-a-massive-step-forward-for-the-14-year-old-game/1100-6530266/" data-ref-id="1100-6530266">Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals update</a> that makes significant changes to the popular game with regards to its visuals.</p><p>In other news, A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters on April 4, starring Jack Black and Jason Momoa. The game will get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-adding-live-event-and-dlc-tied-to-movie-complete-with-jack-black/1100-6530227/" data-ref-id="1100-6530227">DLC based on the movie</a>.</p>
