Some are comparing this to some of the exosuit-powered abilities from Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, and indeed, it does look like the wall-jumping will provide for new ways to get the drop on enemies.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1957882501810254317" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FIRST LOOK: NEXT LEVEL OMNIMOVEMENT<br>Omnimovement is more dynamic than ever, with enhanced movement tuning and the addition of Wall Jumps for fluid traversal.<br>Additionally to further refine the movement in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a>, Tactical Sprint will shift into a selectable Perk. <a href="https://t.co/LOhz0nowlt" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LOhz0nowlt</a></p>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1957882501810254317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The addition of wall-jumping is just one of many changes to the multiplayer formula in Black Ops 7 that <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-makes-highly-requested-change-to-tac-sprint-alongside-omnimovement-updates-3239782/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto outlined</a>.  <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-again-black-ops-7-does-plenty-to-avoid-feeling-like-dlc/1100-6534011/" data-ref-id="1100-6534011">GameSpot also got to see and play</a> the game already.</p><p>Black Ops 7 also does not have tactical sprint by default--now, players need to use a perk for it. Additionally, there is no more aim-down-sights while sliding, diving, or wall-jumping without the use of a perk. There is also a new Gung Ho perk that allows players to sprint while firing.</p><p>Players can also expect a new active camo field upgrade in Black Ops 7 that allows players to become temporarily invisible--here's how that looks:</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957874115685282045" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">manual doors on multiplayer maps are gone</a>. In Black Ops 6, players could open and close doors, or peek them, but in Black Ops 7, the doors are not manually operated. Another major change for Black Ops 7 is the introduction of a new social feature that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-aims-to-make-sharing-weapon-builds-easier-than-ever/1100-6534014/" data-ref-id="1100-6534014">allows players to quickly share their weapon builds with others.</a></p><p>In terms of new modes, Black Ops 7's multiplayer package adds a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-adds-a-new-20v20-mode-with-wingsuits-and-grappling-hooks/1100-6534075/" data-ref-id="1100-6534075">20v20 mode called Skirmish that features wingsuits and grappling hooks.</a> This is in addition to core 6v6 maps that the series is known for.</p><p>At launch in November, Black Ops 7 will have 16 6v6 maps--13 are new and three are remakes from Black Ops 2. Skirmish will have two maps at launch. There will be 30 weapons available at launch, including 28 ranged weapons and two melee.

                <p>Blizzard revealed the opening cinematic for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, Midnight, as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, setting the stakes for the second chapter in the game's multi-expansion Worldsoul Saga and proving it ain't easy being a Blood Elf.</p><p dir="ltr">The cinematic depicts Xal'atath, the current big bad of the Warcraft universe, commencing a full-scale invasion of the Blood Elf homeland Quel'Thalas. Blood Elf leaders Lor'themar and Liadrin face off against Xal'atath and her shadowy Void beasts, but it soon becomes apparent that they can do little to stop this threat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Xal'atath's objective seems to be the Sunwell, a potent font of magic power that has been the target of hostile forces multiple times in Warcraft history. First, Arthas and his Scourge army corrupted the Sunwell to create the lich Kel'thuzad back in 2002's </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-2650">Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos</a><span>, an event that led to the former High Elves changing their name to Blood Elves to begin with.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Fast forward a few years and disgraced Blood Elf prince Kael'thas Sunstrider would attempt to restore the Sunwell to its former glory…albeit with the goal of using it to open a portal for a Burning Legion invasion. Players put a stop to that back in 2008 as part of WoW's The Burning Crusade expansion, but with some help from the Draenei, the Sunwell would ultimately be restored as a font of both arcane and holy power.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550292" data-ratio="0.56239015817223" data-width="2845" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550292"></a><figcaption>Lor'themar and the Blood Elves face off against the Void in World of Warcraft: Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550292-wowmidnightcinematiclor%27themar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What Xal'atath wants with the Sunwell isn't exactly clear, but it certainly can't be good. Thankfully, the Light seems keen on stopping her and her Void army, and Liadrin and Alliance forces, seemingly empowered by the Light, push back the encroaching foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Maria Hamilton, associate design director on WoW, told GameSpot in an interview that while it's true players have seen the invasion of Quel'Thalas and the Sunwell before, the nature of this fight is quite different. The Light isn't taking a backseat this time around, and the heroes of Azeroth will have to contend with some never-before-seen Void creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Light is quite actively involved in this fight," Hamilton said. "This is a fight between Light and Void and the Light is there, it is visible and present."</p><p dir="ltr">Xal'atath has become a fan-favorite villain in the WoW community, and this cinematic is the first time players have gotten to truly see just how powerful she is. The cinematic shows she's capable of inflicting mental anguish with just a blink of the eye, though Lor'themar is eventually able to overcome the psychic attack.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550294" data-ratio="0.56258790436006" data-width="2844" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550294"></a><figcaption>Xal'atath is scarier than ever in WoW: Midnight's reveal cinematic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4550294-wowmidnightcinematicxal%27atath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Cinematic director Ben Dai told GameSpot the cinematics team wanted to leave room for imagination when it came to Xal'atath's true power, choosing to hold back on showing her at her full potential. The less she does, the more powerful she feels, Dai said.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's just the tip of the iceberg of what she can do," Dai said. "We want to leave everything else to the game to let the player explore."</p><p dir="ltr">It's after that initial battle depicted in the cinematic that players will begin the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">Midnight expansion</a>, which will revamp the Blood Elf lands of Quel'Thalas first introduced in 2007 to be more in line with the modern version of the game. The expansion will also introduce <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">player housing in full</a>, add a new Allied Race in the form of the Haranir, make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-finally-making-transmog-much-cheaper-and-more-convenient/1100-6534017/" data-ref-id="1100-6534017">major changes to transmog</a>, and bring a third, Void-powered specialization for Demon Hunters. WoW's Midnight expansion does not have an exact release date just yet but is slated to arrive in early 2026.</p>

Suddenly, the lights of the entire hotel go out, and things spiral from there.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh7TVa8yUf8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yh7TVa8yUf8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Eventually, the two women find the hotel manager, who begins to apologize for the power outage and says he'll fix it immediately. Suddenly, the man is attacked by a hooded figure--who also happens to have pale white skin resembling the undead or the zealots of Resident Evil 4--with a plastic bag, sending the Ashfords running for their lives. Grace walks ahead of her mother, and when she turns to say something, she screams ... and the trailer ends.</p><p>The trailer provided a little more information about Grace, who was the playable character in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/" data-ref-id="1100-6532336">hands-on preview</a> Capcom showed off when it announced Resident Evil Requiem in June.
