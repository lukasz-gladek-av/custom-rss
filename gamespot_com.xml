                <p>Earlier this year, Pocketpair debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a>, and the open-world monster-taming adventure quickly became one of the breakout hits of 2024. But the year isn't over yet, and Pocketpair is already teasing Palworld's first-ever crossover collaboration in 2025, which will bring the heavily armed and adorable monsters alongside characters from the crafting game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/terraria-review/1900-6316247/" data-ref-id="1900-6316247">Terraria</a>.</p><p>The announcement was made on Pocketpari's official Palworld account on X. Pocketpair also teased news about the next update for Palworld, which will arrive "very soon."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palworld_en/status/1861560568756462079" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">2024 isn't finished yet for Palworld and we have some exciting news about the next update coming VERY SOON...<br>But first, we want to tell you about something happening in 2025!<br>! ! ! Palworld x Terraria ! ! !<br>More info coming soon! <a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@terraria_logic</a> <a href="https://t.co/nmLpkPCn2t" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/nmLpkPCn2t</a></p>  â€” Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1861560568756462079?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Palworld and Teraria are very different games, with the latter embracing a throwback 2D style set in a sandbox structure that resembles Minecraft. By contrast, Palworld has a 3D landscape and gameplay elements that are very similar to Nintendo's Pokemon. We're not sure how the elements of those two games will be blended together for the collaboration. Perhaps Palworld characters can appear in Terraria and vice versa.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo's lawsuit</a> against Pocketpair doesn't seem to have slowed down the company's ambitions for Palworld. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">was ported to PlayStation 5</a> earlier this fall, even in Japan, where the company is contesting Nintendo's lawsuit. Pocketpair subsequently disclosed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">the three patents that Nintendo claims Palworld infringed upon</a>, as well as the relatively low amount--which is roughly just under $33,000--that the latter is seeking in damages. The lawsuit seeks the same amount in damages to The Pokemon Company, as well. Meanwhile, Pocketpair and Sony have formed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-and-sony-are-teaming-up/1100-6524828/" data-ref-id="1100-6524828">Palworld Entertainment</a> to expand the franchise and create new merchandise and licensing opportunities.</p>

                <p>If there were ever any doubt about the ever-increasing cultural footprint of the Call of Duty franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops 6</a> was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">October's best-selling game in the US</a>, and also the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far</a>. Now, the franchise has apparently inspired the nationally ranked University of Kentucky men's basketball team to reach new heights.</p><p>The Kentucky Wildcats are currently ranked No. 8 in the nation and undefeated at 5-0, which senior guard Koby Brea attributes to the team's Call of Duty-inspired training program, Ball of Duty. During a press conference attended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kentucky Sports Radio</a>, Brea explained the rules of the Ball of Duty and how it was adopted by the team.</p><p>"We start to see more clips on film of how connected our team is defensively. How many kills we're getting--you know, three stops in a row," said Brea. "That's something that we take pride [in] and it's something funny that the coaches do. They call it Ball of Duty, and it's just [because] a lot of guys on the team play Call of Duty... And that's like a game within the game... Every game so far, we've been winning that battle."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTkIUBgZGow" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oTkIUBgZGow" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a solid strategy for almost any sports team. Keeping the other side from scoring is the key to winning games. It sounds like the University of Kentucky coaches have simply put the idea of multiple defensive stops as "kills" into a concept that's been embraced by their Call of Duty-loving players. If it inspires the team to play better defense, then the coaching team has done their job.</p><p>Once the players are off the court, they can dive into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">the new Black Ops 6 Zombies map</a> in early December, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/become-a-gun-toting-raccoon-no-not-that-one-with-call-of-dutys-new-dlc/1100-6528074/" data-ref-id="1100-6528074">play as a gun-toting raccoon</a> in the latest DLC. Looking ahead, Microsoft has reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the franchise's future</a>, and there are also early rumors about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sledgehammer-games-reportedly-leading-development-on-2027s-call-of-duty/1100-6528047/" data-ref-id="1100-6528047">2027's Call of Duty game</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-gearbox-trying-to-show-game-early-to-terminally-ill-fan/1100-6527412/" data-ref-id="1100-6527412">a terminally ill Borderlands fan</a> named Caleb McAlpine put out what he described as a "long shot" plea to Gearbox to allow him to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">Borderlands 4</a> before he passes away. According to McAlpine, his stage-4 cancer means he may have less than two years to live. Fortunately, Gearbox has come through for McAlpine and fulfilled his wish.</p><p>In an update posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/borderlands3/comments/1h01zdn/just_an_update_thank_you_everyone/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, McAlpine thanked everyone who supported his request and confirmed that Gearbox flew him and a friend out via first class to Gearbox's headquarters in Frisco, Texas. During his visit, McAlpine met the developers and Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford. He also shared his first impressions of Borderlands 4.</p><p>"We got to play what they have for Borderlands 4 so far, and it was amazing," wrote McAlpine. "I don't know if I will be around when the game comes out, but I just want to say thank you to all of you for all of your love and support and for helping in making this happen. It truly was an amazing experience and it was just awesome."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was officially announced during the opening night of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Gamescom</a> in August, but we still don't know too much about the sequel. Gearbox has shown off concept art for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/" data-ref-id="1100-6526221">a new planet that will appear in the game</a>, while also teasing a new character who is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">"far more dangerous" than Handsome Jack</a>.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025, but there isn't an exact release window yet. Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, has indicated that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-wont-be-released-close-to-each-other-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527624/" data-ref-id="1100-6527624">won't release Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4 in close proximity</a> to each other. For now, we'll just have to wait for more details to emerge.</p>
