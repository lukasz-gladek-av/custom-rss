                <p>A sizeable portion of Nintendo Switch 2 players have been very vocal about their opposition to Game-Key Cards that allow players to digitally download a game rather than including it on a cartridge. But there's at least one publisher that's taken this criticism to heart by switching gears from This may be a welcome development for Nintendo Switch 2 players who hate Game-Key Cards back to cartridges, thanks to the new size options offered by Nintendo.</p><p>Inin Games shared the news that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-game-ditches-game-key-cards-for-a-physical-release-but-itll-cost-more/1100-6537110/" data-ref-id="1100-6537110">upcoming US and European run</a> of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/r-type-dimensions-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-706122">R-Type Dimensions III</a> is going to be released on a physical cartridge instead of a Game-Key Cards. The company also cited a recalculation of the <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">production prices</a> as a reason for the change. Apparently it's cheaper to release a game on Game-Key Cards, but the rumored measures taken by Nintendo apparently lowered the price for cartridges as well.</p><p>Game-Key Cards have been in physical Nintendo Switch 2 game boxes, but those cards don't actually include any game data. Instead, the Game-Key Cards allow the console to download the game from the internet. </p><p>Nintendo hasn't issued any statement about this yet, <a href="https://x.com/DoesItPlay1/status/2001264866632372548" rel="nofollow ">but the rumors suggest that smaller cartridges</a> are being offered in 16GB and 32GB sizes, both of which are cheaper than the standard 64GB cartridge. Publishers who wanted to sell Switch 2 games on physical cartridges were previously stuck paying for and using Nintendo's 64GB cartridge. The publishers who released larger games were also forced to use Game-Key Cards because their titles couldn't fit on a single cartridge. There's currently no indication that Nintendo is planning any cartridges bigger than 64GB to accommodate those larger games. If those were available, they might mitigate the need for Game-Key Cards.</p><p>The one bit of bad news from R-Type Dimensions III is that the game will be a little more expensive now that Inin Games is going for the physical cartridge. Regardless, Inin pledged to honor the original price for anyone who preordered the game before the change was made.</p><p>"We'd like to sincerely thank the community for the passionate discussion, the feedback, and the patience over the past days," reads <a href="https://iningames.com/blogs/news/update-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-of-r-type-dimensions-iii" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a statement by Inin Games</a>. "Your enthusiasm for physical games and for R-Type in particular made this solution possible, and we're very happy to be able to deliver a true cartridge release."</p><p>Last month, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-pokopia/" data-ref-id="5000-694776">Pokemon Pokopia</a> will be the first game published by Nintendo itself that will only be given <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-be-first-nintendo-published-title-to-get-game-key-card/1100-6536144/" data-ref-id="1100-6536144">a physical release as a Key Card</a>.</p>

                <p>The Witcher and Cyberpunk developer CD Projekt Red is the latest company to sound off on the use of AI in gaming. During CD Projekt Red's latest earnings briefing, Joint CEO Michał Nowakowski said<span> there are "meaningful" and "real" benefits to using the technology.</span></p><p>The company is already implementing such technologies "mainly in the productivity areas" and so far that's where the "largest benefits" have stemmed from, he <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/result-center/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explained</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/the-witcher-4-and-cyberpunk-2-boss-is-skeptical-ai-can-replace-industry-talent-and-cant-imagine-reducing-headcount-thanks-to-the-tech-its-not-gonna-be-making-the-witcher-5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar.</a> A developer won't be able to use AI to make an entire game, though, and humans will remain essential to the process, he said.</p>

<p>"The benefits are real, they’re meaningful; but it's not a situation--and I'm unaware of such a situation--where AI could 'sit down and make games.' That's our take. It doesn't mean it's not gonna be useful, but it's not gonna be making The Witcher 5, or 6, or anything like that," Nowakowski explained.</p><p>Nowakowski also pushed back against the idea that the mass layoffs happening in the video game industry today are due to AI's acceleration. Instead, he said the cuts are largely the result of games being canceled.</p><p>"Some studios have been going through turmoil; there were some project closures and so on, which led to many redundancies in the gaming industry; we've all seen that--it's been very dramatic in many cases. But, literally kill me here, but I don't recall a single time when it would be attributable directly to AI. At least I don't know about that."</p><p>And looking to the future, if AI is adopted more broadly, Nowakowski does not believe it will lead to net job losses overall. "I don't imagine that," he said.</p><p>This echoes what others have said, pointing to previous labor revolutions that impacted some jobs in the short term but boosted total employment overall on a longer timeline. Recently, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0yT4ec9M6GobLC5ByN8pX3?si=0Vg8nv83RsyqI0LqfYTv-Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">workers whose job is "the task" may be at the greatest risk</a>.</p><p>The AI issue continues to be controversial, in part because of how the term is defined. Developers have been using versions of AI to make games for decades, after all. One of the newest forms of AI is generative AI, and it is baked into products that many game developers use, including Unreal Engine and Photoshop, among others. Recently, Larian's CEO <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">drew backlash for his comments</a> on how the developer might use AI, and he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/" data-ref-id="1100-6537085">plans to answer more questions about this in January. </a></p>

<p dir="ltr">As to be expected with seasonal content, new maps and weapons are planned for Battlefield 6. The studio says this content is being developed to "introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways."</p><p dir="ltr">This only gives players a vague sense of what to expect, but for Season 1, Battlefield 6 gained three <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-all-new-maps-and-vehicles/1100-6535770/">multiplayer maps</a>, more vehicles, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-new-battlefield-6-weapons-in-season-1-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6535768/">several new weapons</a>, and some additional attachments. The content was rolled out in three separate phases, and it's likely future seasons could follow the same approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also touched on the game's free-to-play Redsec battle royale mode. The game currently doesn't feature a solo playlist, which has been highly-requested from the community, and the studio is aware of the interest and working to deliver an option for solo players.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield," the developer said. "Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more."</p><p dir="ltr">The developer's post also included several statistics for Battlefield 6 in 2025. Players across multiplayer and Redsec played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours. This overall gametime resulted in 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives. Engineer was the most used class at 28%, but it was a close race with support players making up 27%, assault players at 26%, and the recon class was the least used at 19%.</p><p dir="ltr">Most recently, Battlefield 6 released Winter Offensive as the last update for Season 1. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-buggy-update-is-being-fixed-as-new-patches-scheduled-and-tournament-delayed/1100-6536891/">Winter Offensive had a rough launch</a>, which led to Battlefield Studios releasing a series of hotfixes and updates across all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">Battlefield 6 is 2025's No. 1 best-selling game</a> in the US so far, toppling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which currently sits at No. 7 on the list.</p>

                <p>Christmas is around the corner and one of Universal Studios' biggest attractions is the meet-and-greet with The Grinch. Meeting Whoville's Christmas curmudgeon can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSVKYYOiRVD/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">take up to over five hours</a> with the lines, but with social interactions going viral, it's hard not to resist a photo and a few minutes with the beloved monster.</p><p>The interactions are fairly quick; you can maybe get a quick question in, and then the photo, and be on your way. Fortnite creative developer <a href="https://x.com/ImmatureGamer/status/2001727399910867200" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Immature asked Mr. Grinch if he played Fortnite</a>. Innocent enough, but in the typical Grinch way, he turned sour on the game, saying it got boring and needed him to be in it.</p><p>"I used to, but then it got boring. Very boring. But I know they're always releasing new skins and characters. I heard that [Marty] McFly guy is in there now. I heard Eminem was in there--there's a bunch of new things. When are they going to put me in there? If I was in the game, it would be fantastic, but since I'm not..."</p><p>Considering the hundreds of character skins over the years, it feels surprising that the Grinch isn't in the game. Fortnite was quick to respond saying "No promises. But you're at least gonna have to get into the Christmas spirit first, Mr. Grinch."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2001730375001788601" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No promises.

Three brand-new collabs have already been revealed: Harry Potter, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Bleach. Harry Potter will feature Fortnite characters in Hogwarts uniforms, while Bleach is expected to bring four character-based skins. The SpongeBob collaboration includes the Patty Wagon as a car cosmetic, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spongebob-might-not-be-the-only-paramount-cartoon-coming-to-fortnite-reports-suggest/1100-6536487/" data-ref-id="1100-6536487">reports also pointing to SpongeBob and Patrick appearing as sidekicks</a>.</p><p>The Back to the Future collaboration from the current battle pass is expanding on December 23, adding a Doc Brown skin and a DeLorean time machine car skin, which will be free in Fortnite for players who already own it in Rocket League. Winterfest will also expand existing music collaborations, with Hatsune Miku and Sabrina Carpenter each receiving holiday-themed skins and new jam tracks. Additionally, rumored but unconfirmed collabs like Home Alone and Batman Beyond could still appear, as there's some space left in the Winterfest schedule.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">IO Interactive has been telling the story of Agent 47 for 25 years now, but soon the Hitman studio is about to embark on a new journey, with a character steeped in even more history. 007: First Light looks to take a new approach to James Bond by digging into his early life as an agent, while meeting some unique and colorful characters along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">At The Game Awards, the game's first villain--the pirate king Bawma--was revealed, along with confirmation that actor and musician Lenny Kravitz will assume the role. Earlier in the year, IO confirmed that one of Bond's trusted associates, Dr. Selina Tan, will be portrayed by English actress Gemma Chan.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot sat down with 007: First Light narrative director Martin Emborg to talk about the star power fueling his game, the potential pitfalls of revealing too much info too soon, and a little bit more about where Bond will run into Bawma during this adventure.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT1kFDUmu_4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hT1kFDUmu_4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Bawma</span></h2><p dir="ltr">While the character of Bawma was being worked on before Lenny Kravitz officially signed on to the project, Emborg tells us that the star was a big part of creating the character who appears in the trailer shown during The Game Awards.</p><p dir="ltr">"We knew the character of Bawma was a larger-than-life, colorful character," Emborg said, "So, when Lenny came on board, he helped shape the character in a big way. He's had a major impact on Bawma; The cool outfit, the character traits, the backstory, all of these things we went back and forth and crafted this character together. We designed the character in cooperation with him."</p><p dir="ltr">So who is Bawma, and what do we know about Aleph in Mauritania, the place where Bond will encounter him? Emborg says that Aleph is a perilous place for a young secret agent to try to infiltrate, and Bawma oversees it with an iron fist.</p><p dir="ltr">"It is a kingdom, and Bawma is its pirate king," Emborg says. "Aleph is one of the most dangerous places on Earth. Somewhere where, if you don't keep your wits about you, you probably won't make it out. When you first see it, you think it's going to be a high adventure, but the closer you get, you realize how dodgy it actually is. Then, once you enter it, you think, 'I should probably not be here.' It's really one of my favorite locations in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">When we asked him what will bring Bond to Aleph in the first place, Emborg didn't want to give too much away. "I think we have an amazing story lined up, and in my dream world, everyone would see the teaser trailer, immediately buy the game, and go in cold," he said. "I love teasing things, but I think the more context we provide in trailers, the less 'cold' players will be going in, so I prefer to keep things fresh."</p><p dir="ltr">He did, however, confirm one key thing: Bawma is <em>a </em>villain within 007: First Light, not <em>the</em> villain. There are still more bad guys to come.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626274"></a><figcaption>007: First Light</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4626274-bond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Cards close to the chest</h2><p dir="ltr">While that "dream world" of players going in cold sounds nice, Emborg is well aware that his team needs to get the word out about its game and the cool things within. Still, while he understands that hype is important, he is also very mindful not to give <em>too</em> much away."I'm fully aware that when doing big entertainment like this, you need to show people what you've got and what they're in for," Emborg said. "I think this trailer is a great way to show something like Lenny off, but how deep do we go?"</p><p dir="ltr">"I've absolutely come to terms with the fact that you need to show some of these great things off," he continued. "In an ideal world, people would go in cold and have an amazing experience. People will still have an amazing experience with Bond either way, but I don't want to supply you with too much context."</p><p dir="ltr">That being said, the team's excitement as time marches closer to launch is palpable, and Emborg is especially eager for players to play through the story he and his team have created. "Having worked on something for this long, it's exciting to finally get here, and I'm really just looking forward to getting this in people's hands," Emborg said. "We're teasing little elements of the story, we're showing some of the places you're going and the people you're meeting, but the whole game is a great adventure."</p><p dir="ltr">In Emborg's mind, there's one piece of the puzzle that stands above the rest in terms of importance: the characters. "I think when you get the full picture, you go on a thrill ride that is, importantly, character driven," he says. "When you're making something that is Bond, the character is essential. Sure, you'll have the usual village of supporters and the globe-trotting adventure, but I'm really looking forward to people getting time with our version of James Bond, because he is a lot of fun."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YD9SBrID6Bc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YD9SBrID6Bc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span>The doctor is in</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Among the key characters who drive a Bond adventure are his supporting team like Q and M, who give him not only his missions, but also his equipment for the job. Earlier this year, IO revealed one of those supporters in Dr. Selina Tan, played by Gemma Chan, who Emborg says made the character her own right from the start.</p><p dir="ltr">"We'd been talking to Gemma, and I had a character bio and an idea in my head of how I wanted Dr. Tan to be," Emborg said. "She came in and had a take where, afterward, I threw everything I'd prepared out, because she just nailed the character in a way I hadn't even thought of. She gave Selina Tan a kind of charm and quirkiness I hadn't anticipated, which was a joy."</p><p dir="ltr">For Emborg, Chan's unique approach, and the way it changed the character completely, is the mark of an actor at the top of their game. "That's what having great actors is like," Emborg said. "They do their homework and find an angle on the character that, in the best cases, you don't expect. The actor does a take and you think, 'Wow, I didn't see that coming.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Character-changing moments like Gemma Chan's take, according to Emborg, are a highlight of the entire narrative experience. "I love [moments like that]," Emborg said. "One of my favorite parts of working with actors is when you've prepared all this material, you've lived with these characters for a long time, and then the actor arrives in the booth and you have that 'eureka' moment; it doesn't always happen, but when it does, it makes you realize why that actor is such a heavy hitter."</p><p dir="ltr">007: First Light is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026.</p>
