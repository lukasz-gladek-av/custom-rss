                <p>The first box-office numbers for A Minecraft Movie have arrived, with the Warner Bros. video game movie bringing in $10.55 million at the domestic box office for its Thursday previews.</p><p>For comparison, the video game movie Five Nights at Freddy's made $10.3 million in the US for its previews, while The Super Mario Bros. Movie brought in $26.5 million.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/minecraft-movie-box-office-previews-1236358670/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety supplied the numbers</a>, and added that A Minecraft Movie is projected to earn between $70 million-$80 million for its opening weekend in the US. For its part, Warner Bros. is penciling in a a more conservative projection of $65 million. Some estimates, Variety said, peg A Minecraft Movie at $90 million for its first weekend.</p><p>Another point of comparison is Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which made $60 million in the US for its opening weekend, going on to bring in $236 million stateside and $255 million from international markets for a total of $491 million globally.</p><p>Globally, box-office estimates suggest A Minecraft Movie could make as much as $150 million over its first weekend. The movie carried a production cost of $150 million, with many millions upon millions more spent on marketing. Despite those hefty costs, Variety said A Minecraft Movie is poised to become a financial success. This would be good news for Warner Bros., as the company's recent releases, Mickey 17 and The Alto Knights, failed to perform up to expectations.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie stars Jack Black, Jason Momoa, Daniella Brooks, Sebastian Hansen, and Emmy Myers. It's directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess.</p><p>Like some of Hess' other movies, A Minecraft Movie is getting mixed reviews from critics. It has a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-minecraft-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">47 score on GameSpot sister site Metacritic</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_minecraft_movie" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">49% on Rotten Tomatoes.</a> GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/a-minecraft-movie-review/1900-6418350/" data-ref-id="1900-6418350">A Minecraft Movie review</a> scored the film a 7/10. Reviewer Chris Hayner said, "As you sit down in theaters this weekend, it's time to let your sense of childhood wonderment take over for a little while. I don't think you'll regret it."</p>

                <p>Following President Trump unveiling his <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-tariffs-news-04-04-25/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial new tariff plan</a>, Nintendo has announced that it is delaying US preorders. Originally scheduled to start on April 9, a Nintendo representative has since confirmed this date has been pushed back indefinitely in order for the company to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." As such, it is likely we will see an sizeable increase in the console's price before it is relisted.</p><p>The full statement, which was given to GameSpot via a Nintendo spokesperson, can be found below:</p><p>"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged."</p><p>Nintendo's latest console has already been the subject of scrutiny--and more than a few<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-price-roasted-by-duolingo/1100-6530617/" data-ref-id="1100-6530617"> jokes</a>--due to its $450 price tag and the cost of its upcoming first-party titles. Following its reveal, Mario Kart World made headlines as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">Nintendo's priciest game</a> that doesn't include a physical accessory. And yet, it seems like prices will only go up from here.</p><p>For months now, experts have speculated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/#comments-block-33629463" data-ref-id="1100-6528381">President Trump's proposed tariffs</a> would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">significant ramifications</a> for the video game industry. Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-take-on-nintendo-switch-2-reveal/" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> that Nintendo is likely to "feel the impact" of the <a href="https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1907541343250878752" rel="nofollow ">tariffs on places like Vietnam and Japan</a>, where many Switch 2 units are produced. MST Financial analyst David Gibson told <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/chrisbratt.bsky.social/post/3lludkrrvmc2r" rel="nofollow ">FT</a> that Nintendo had already shipped more than 350,000 Switch 2 units to the USA back in January in an attempt to get ahead of the tariffs. It was also previously speculated by Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis that a Switch 2 "price increase in 2026 might be on the table" if tariffs persist.</p><p>Of course some have theorized that these tariffs might encourage Nintendo to produce Switch 2 units in the United States. However, Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1907789618294005816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed out</a> that this would be incredibly unrealistic.</p><p>"Nintendo would need to spend billions to open a factory in the US," Ahmad said. "It'd probably take 4-5 years to complete this. Not to mention the time and cost to rebuild supply chain infrastructure and source components (which would be subject to tariffs because they're made outside the US). They'd then need to find, train and pay employees to operate the factory."</p><p>During Trump's first presidency, tariffs did not apply to video game consoles because console manufacturers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-trumps-tariffs-raise-video-game-and-console-prices-heres-what-we-know/1100-6528381/">successfully lobbied the government for a special exception.</a> This time, however, it would appear we are seeing the consequences unfold.</p>

                <p>Bethesda's Todd Howard recently revealed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout/" data-ref-id="5000-929">Fallout</a> was adapted as a television series rather than a movie.</p><p>Howard's comments were part of a bigger <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/?open=false#%C2%A7game-studios-desperate-for-switch-dev-kits" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Variety</a> about the process of video game adaptations. In it, Howard explains that a movie version of Fallout would've felt "too compressed" as the game series has such a vast and interesting world.</p><p>"Originally, a lot of people were approaching to do a feature film. And looking at what we wanted to do for this one, that felt too compressed. Fallout is such an amazing world--what would we really want to watch in it? Well, we’d like to watch the next story, or new stories in that world, as opposed to, again, in this instance, adapting a story we had told and kind of compressing it down. For this one, we were very much interested in telling new stories," Howard explained.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kQ8i2FpRDk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="16">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0kQ8i2FpRDk?start=16" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That approach worked out for Bethesda and Amazon, as Fallout was well-received and enjoyed by fans. Now, a second season is in the works. Todd Howard also teased a little about making sure that Fallout feels as welcoming as possible to players by the time the show's second season comes out.</p><p>"So we had done the work for Season 1 to really make the games welcoming to a new audience and have them in a good place. And it was hugely successful. We learned a lot and as we head into future things — knowing when a new season comes out that there’s going to be an audience, both a new one and a returning one to these games — we’re thinking, how do we make it the best it can be for the players?"</p><p>Todd Howard has previously teased Fallout 5, but also admitted that Bethesda Game Studios' focus right now is on continuing development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-483377">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>. Remasters or updates for live service games in the series like Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter feel like possibilities, though.</p><p>Fallout's second season does not have a release window, but the first season is currently available to stream on Prime Video. When it comes to video game TV shows coming out more imminently, an animated Devil May Cry adaptation just released on Netflix, and the second season of The Last of Us begins on HBO later in the month.</p>
