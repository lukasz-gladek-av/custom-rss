                <p>Thunderful Games, the developer of the SteamWorld series, has announced 80-100 layoffs at the company and a reshifting focus for third-party games. In a <a href="https://thunderfulgroup.com/news-room/press-releases/2024-11-14-thunderful-group-implements-strategic-restructuring-program-doubling-down-on-third-party-game-publishing-and-scaling-back-internal-development-resulting-in-write-downs-of-220-240-msek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, the company said the layoffs were part of a "restructuring." Along with the layoffs, an unspecified number of game projects were officially canceled.</p><p>CEO of Thunderful Martin Walfisz said that the decision came with regret, but this isn't the first time the company has seen layoffs this year. Back in January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-publisher-thunderful-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/1100-6520404/" data-ref-id="1100-6520404">Thunderful saw 20% of the company's staff laid off</a> in a similar "restructuring," something that Walfisz acknowledges and saw as unavoidable.</p><p>"It is regrettable to announce a second restructuring of Thunderful in less than a year, but we unfortunately see no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group’s long-term sustainability and resilience," Walfisz said. "The strategic move towards publishing games from external partners allows us to reduce fixed costs, increase flexibility, and better control our cash flow. We have many talented and dedicated employees, and it is with great regret that we are forced to part ways."</p><p>According to the press release, the projections for money saved from these reductions will gain 80-90 MSEK (approximately $7.3-8.2 million), but it doesn't expect the majority of these savings to take effect until the first quarter of 2025. The restructuring program will be implemented immediately.</p><p>As for refocusing on external games, the company said that it hopes it will help reduce fixed costs and allow for a higher turnout rate, but still retain some internal development capacity, which includes games like the SteamWorld series and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lost-in-random-review-six-appeal/1900-6417731/" data-ref-id="1900-6417731">Lost in Random</a>.</p><p>Thunderful's recent release, SteamWorld Heist 2, was released back in August and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/search/steamworld%20heist%202/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned rather good reviews</a>, including at GameSpot where it received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/steamworld-heist-2-review-like-clockwork/1900-6418264/" data-ref-id="1900-6418264">9/10</a>.</p>

                <p>Blizzard is hiring for an unannounced upcoming open-world shooter game. A job ad posted on November 13 revealed this, though the requisition doesn't have too many details about what the game is.</p><p>The<a href="https://careers.blizzard.com/global/en/job/R024230/Associate-Design-Director-Innovation-Unannounced-Game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> job ad for the Associate Design Director, Innovation</a> says this person will be the "vision holder and owner of key strategic innovations" for the upcoming unannounced "open-world shooter game."</p><p>The job calls for someone to help implement strategies that have "shown potential but have not yet permeated the AAA space." The successful candidate will work with Blizzard's engineering, art, and audio teams to help guide the project from concept to release. This wording specifically suggests whatever this game is, it might be early in development.</p><p>According to the job listing (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-starcraft-reports-blizzard-is-hiring-for-an-open-world-shooter-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), a successful candidate can expect to earn a minimum annual salary of $124,400, with the potential of reaching $230,300.</p><p>This job ad was only posted this week, but journalist Jason Schreier's new book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment, contained a passage mentioning that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-trying-to-make-a-starcraft-shooter-again/1100-6526763/" data-ref-id="1100-6526763">a StarCraft shooter is, or was, in development at Blizzard</a>. Whether or not this newly posted job ad is connected to that is unknown.</p><p>The rumored StarCraft shooter was said to be led by Dan Hay, the former Ubisoft and Far Cry veteran who joined Blizzard as vice president and general manager in 2022.</p><p>As part of the iterative nature of game development, Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about 50% of the games it works on</a>, so whatever new Blizzard shooter is in development, it's not guaranteed to release. In January this year, Microsoft announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-untitled-survival-game-has-been-canceled-after-president-leaves-report/1100-6520603/" data-ref-id="1100-6520603">Blizzard had canceled its survival game</a>, codenamed Odyssey, with some staffers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-reportedly-trying-to-make-a-starcraft-shooter-again/1100-6526763/" data-ref-id="1100-6526763">moving over to an incubation project that was said to be a StarCraft shooter.</a></p>

Of those three titles, Towerborne will eventually make it to Xbox Series X|S, but don't get used to having Microsoft games skipping consoles. The company's gaming CEO, Phil Spencer, has indicated that this was "an anomaly" that's unlikely to be repeated.</p><p>"This is historical," Spencer told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-phil-spencer-blizzard-avowed-south-of-midnight" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game FIle</a>. "There might always be some anomalies, but I look at those three as an anomaly. We want our games playable across as many screens as possible. We think about the Xbox platform as the Xbox console, PC, and cloud. We want all the games playable across all of those. We want them to be Play Anywhere."</p><p>While there don't appear to be any plans to bring World of Warcraft to Xbox consoles, Spencer has been bullish about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-comments-on-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation/1100-6522971/" data-ref-id="1100-6522971">sharing select Microsoft-owned titles with Sony's PlayStation</a>.

Spencer also mentioned his larger goal of allowing players to own a title regardless of where they're playing it.</p><p>"We want to get to the point where, when you buy, whether you're buying on cloud--which we're getting ready to introduce--buying on PC and buying on console, you own it across all of the Xbox ecosystem," said Spencer.</p>

                <p>The video game console market "isn't growing," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in a new interview, and that's part of the reason why you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">don't need an Xbox to play Xbox these days. </a></p><p>"The console space all up isn't growing, across all of them [Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo]. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it's about PC, it's about cloud, and it's about making our games more available in more places," Spencer told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Just because the console market isn't growing, that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning consoles. Spencer said Microsoft will "definitely do more consoles in the future," as well as "other devices."</p><p>None of this is a surprise, as Microsoft has already confirmed a next-gen Xbox that promises the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history</a>. As for the "other devices," Spencer may be referring to the Xbox handheld device that is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/" data-ref-id="1100-6527758">"few years out."</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer reiterated that Microsoft is probably not planning a mid-gen Xbox refresh, like Sony did with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-review-powerful-on-paper-ordinary-in-action/1100-6527571/" data-ref-id="1100-6527571">PS5 Pro</a>. He said, "We don't need to do incremental hardware for our own benefit. Does a new device really give you a unique experience on screen in some way?"</p><p>Years ago, the leap between the original Xbox and Xbox 360 was significant in terms of graphics and performance, Spencer said, but these days "it's harder to show the benefits" of more powerful hardware alone.</p><p>A new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This Is An Xbox" ad campaign</a> reminds people that Xbox is no longer limited to being a piece of plastic under your TV. Your phone is an Xbox, as is your TV, and any number of other devices, because Xbox games--and Game Pass--are available in those places. Spencer said he understands some part of the Xbox audience enjoys the "simplicity of a single box, single platform, single game." But the reality is that, "Today's largest games are bigger than any of the individual platforms."</p><p>He said the Xbox platform should be about games, characters, and worlds, as opposed to any one dedicated device. "That's how we think about Xbox today," he said.</p>
