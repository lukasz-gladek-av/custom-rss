                <p>This week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 3 will launch by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">adding Jean Grey aka Phoenix to the lineup</a>, with Blade slated to arrive soon after. And while the new season is arriving in close proximity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">the FF were already added to the game</a> earlier this year. In the future, NetEase has plans to incorporate more content from the MCU and comics, while also ensuring that it doesn't interfere with the game's pre-planned storylines.</p><p>Marvel Rivals progression systems game director Guangyun Chen recently told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/marvel-rivals-lead-confirms-future-content-createdsystemic-manner-mcu-comics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a> that the game is "driven by its own universe and seasonal storylines" and that the seasons are planned out far ahead of time. He went on to explain that the dev team is developing new seasons in "a systemic manner" while also keeping an eye out for fresh additions from the films and comics.</p><p>"We are closely monitoring the release schedules of comics and movies, and we will incorporate relevant content when appropriate," said Chen. "However, this will not disrupt our own content development timeline."</p><p>After The Fantastic Four: First Steps, the next Marvel movie to hit theaters will be Spider-Man: Brand New Day on July 13, 2026. That seems far enough ahead to incorporate some Spidey-related characters, but it's also possible that NetEase may pull content from some of Marvel's TV shows on Disney+. Daredevil, for example, seems like he'd be a good fit for the game. NetEase also recently disclosed that it has the rights to include any character from the past eight decades of Marvel comics.</p><p>Season 3 of Marvel Rivals will begin on July 11.</p>

This is how you cook food, make ore ingots, and produce other resources. In this guide, we'll discuss all the different types of furnaces, fuels, and explain how smelting works in Minecraft.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_smelting_works_in_Minecraft">How smelting works in Minecraft</a></li><li><a href="#Minecraft_furnace_types">Minecraft furnace types</a><ul><li><a href="#Furnace">Furnace</a></li><li><a href="#Blast_Furnace">Blast Furnace</a></li><li><a href="#Smoker">Smoker</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Campfires">Campfires</a></li><li><a href="#Smelting_fuel_types">Smelting fuel types</a></li><li><a href="#Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_smelting_works_in_Minecraft">How smelting works in Minecraft</h2><p dir="ltr">Smelting in Minecraft allows you to place a material and fuel into a furnace in order to cook food, make ore ingots, turn sand into glass, refine stones, and more. To smelt, you first need to build a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Minecraft_furnace_types">Minecraft furnace types</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three different types of smelters you can build in Minecraft.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291" data-ratio="0.56222639149468" data-width="1599" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528291"></a><figcaption>Smelting with furnaces in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528291-smeltingguide.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Furnace">Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the first smelter you'll have the resources to craft. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-furnace-in-minecraft/1100-6526071/">standard furnace</a> works for all types of resources you can smelt, such as food, ore, and sand. You can even smelt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-terracotta-in-minecraft/1100-6525032/">terracotta</a> to create colorful glazed blocks.</p><p dir="ltr">This furnace only requires eight pieces of cobblestone to build. You can also quickly craft one in the Nether by using Blackstone.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Blast_Furnace">Blast Furnace</h3><p dir="ltr">The blast furnace provides a speedier way to smelt ore types, but it doesn't work for food or other materials. To build, it requires five iron ingots, three pieces of smooth stone, and a regular furnace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Smoker">Smoker</h3><p dir="ltr">The smoker is exclusively built for cooking food, and this will cook faster than the furnace. The build requires four wood logs and a furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Campfires">Campfires</h2><p dir="ltr">While these don't look like the other furnace types, it's worth mentioning you can also cook food on campfires. The campfires are lit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-minecraft-flint/1100-6533030/" data-ref-id="1100-6533030">flint and steel</a>, and these can cook four pieces of food at once.</p><p dir="ltr">To build a standard campfire, you'll need three logs, three sticks, and one piece of coal. For the soul campfire, you'll need three logs, three sticks, and one piece of soul sand.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528290" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528290"></a><figcaption>Cooking chicken in the smoker with coal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4528290-smokingchicken.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Smelting_fuel_types">Smelting fuel types</h2><p dir="ltr">Coal and charcoal are probably the most commonly used resources for fuel, but there are several other items in the game that can be used as fuel for smelting. Here we'll list several resources you can use as fuel, including efficient sources and the less recommended options.</p><p dir="ltr">The most efficient fuel sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Lava bucket: Can smelt 100 items</li><li dir="ltr">Coal block: Can smelt 80 items</li><li dir="ltr">Dried Kelp block: Can smelt 20 items</li><li dir="ltr">Blaze Rod: Can smelt 12 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of coal: Can smelt 8 items</li><li dir="ltr">Piece of charcoal: Can smelt 8 items</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Resource-wise, stacks of coal will be one of the easiest and most efficient fuel sources, especially early in your game. Lava Buckets will be best suited for when you're trying to smelt large qualities of ore.</p><p dir="ltr">Less efficient fuels sources:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Wood logs, planks, fence pieces, wood crafting tables, bookshelves, and more will smelt 1.5 items each</li><li dir="ltr">Wooden tools, signs, and wooden doors will smelt 1 item each</li><li dir="ltr">Then you have other normal items that will smelt less than 1 item each, including wool blocks, carpet, seeds, and bamboo</li></ul><p dir="ltr">These normal items aren't efficient to use as fuel, but in a pinch, you can throw these in your furnace.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Experience_points_and_achievements">Experience points and achievements</h2><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that smelting contributes to your experience points. You gain valuable XP every time you retrieve smelted items from the furnaces.</p><p dir="ltr">There are also Minecraft achievements tied to smelting various items, including cooking your first cake and bread.</p><p dir="ltr">Now that your furnaces are up and running, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-guides-hub/1100-6526408/">Minecraft guides hub</a> for more tips and tricks.</p>
