                <p>While many consider Fortnite to be the pinnacle of the battle royale genre, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, developed by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, was the first to bring mainstream attention to the format. Since then, Greene has formed his own studio, PlayerUnknown Productions, and today the team has announced a three-game plan for the future, which begins with Prologue: Go Wayback.</p><p dir="ltr">Prologue is described as a "single-player open-world emergent game within the survival genre," which will incorporate a new "machine-learning-driven terrain-generation technology" developed by the team. This new tech will allow the game to create "millions" of maps at once, though the specifics of how the tech works were not disclosed. Prologue: Go Wayback is set to launch in Steam Early Access in Q2 2025.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvK-bQwd03g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XvK-bQwd03g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The end goal of the three-game plan is Project Artemis, though little is known about what Greene and his team have planned. "My vision for Artemis is challenging, but we plan to take it one step at a time," Greene says, "and the three games aim to give us a solid tech foundation on which to scale up."</p><p dir="ltr">Along with Prologue and Project Artemis's announcement comes Preface: Undiscovered World, which is a tech demo intended to showcase Melba, PlayerUnknown Productions' new in-game development engine. Preface is in addition to the main three-game plan, and Greene says that the demo will generate an "Earth-sized planet" in real time, with players able to give feedback while exploring. Preface: Undiscovered World is available now for free on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Greene's previous project, PlayerUnknown's Battleground is available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices.</p>

                <p>In the Fallout universe, the popular word game known as Wordle probably wasn't invented because the world became a nuclear wasteland decades before it would have been created. But thanks to a mod, Wordle can be used to replace the hacking minigame in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-new-vegas-review/1900-6282481/" data-ref-id="1900-6282481">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040"><br></a></p><p>The mod was created by a user who goes by W00Z, and it's available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/89317" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>. Like the original Wordle, it gives players six guesses to figure out the five-letter word with the same hint system in place to determine if the included letters are placed in the right position. Failing at Wordle means the in-game hack of the terminal won't work. But if players correctly guess the word, then they gain XP in addition to access to the terminal.</p><p>Some terminals in the game will have a more difficult Wordle puzzle to solve featuring shorter words or fewer attempts to make a guess. A video of W00Z's Wordle mod was posted to YouTube, and it demonstrates how it works in the context of the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFG-RvfLpb0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uFG-RvfLpb0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>W00Z's mod lets users determine if Wordle is installed on every terminal in the game or just a select few. Players can also decide whether the terminals will remember incomplete Wordle games. Additionally, W00Z is planning to introduce Wordle statistics and streaks, and he notes that the mod is already keeping track of players' win-loss records. </p><p>New Vegas will be one of the locations in Prime Video's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-gets-an-exciting-update-with-new-image/1100-6528217/" data-ref-id="1100-6528217">Fallout Season 2</a>, which recently began filming. Earlier this week, Bethesda also released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-biggest-expansion-yet-lets-you-pet-a-very-good-dog/1100-6528198/" data-ref-id="1100-6528198">a new Fallout 76 update</a> that adds pets to the player camps.</p>
