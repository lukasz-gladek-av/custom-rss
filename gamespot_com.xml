                <p>In 2022, Epic Games agreed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-finalizes-order-making-fortnite-dev-pay-245-million-in-refunds/1100-6510151/" data-ref-id="1100-6510151">a massive $520 million settlement</a> with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that Fortnite violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting info about players under the age of 13 without their parents' permission, as well as allegations that Epic "tricked" players into making unintended in-game purchases. The signup period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-your-chunk-of-the-245-million-fortnite-ftc-settlement/1100-6517854/" data-ref-id="1100-6517854">the initial distribution of funds</a> ended in February 2024. But now, the FTC is once again opening the opportunity for players to claim their piece of the Fortnite settlement.</p><p>If players already claimed and received a payment from the FTC during the previous dispersal round, then they won't be eligible for any further claims. Everyone else has until July 9, 2025 to to file their claim with the FTC at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the agency's official site</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process. Players who have not already filed a claim will now have until July 9 to submit one: <a href="https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/aISo5Nfa8Z</a></p>  — FTC (@FTC) <a href="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 25, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>FTC payments will be sent to players either through PayPal or as a check. However, this refund is limited to US citizens. Players under 18 will need their parent or guardian to fill out the paperwork, but anyone older doesn't need any special permission to fill out the form. Domestic players can qualify for the refund if any of the following descriptions applies to them.</p><ul><li>You were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022</li><li>Your child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018</li><li>Your account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges</li></ul><p>Outside of this settlement, Epic Games has done quite well for itself in legal conflicts. Last month, Fortnite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-ios-in-the-us-heres-how-to-download-it/1100-6531696/" data-ref-id="1100-6531696">finally returned to the App Store</a> following a five-year legal battle with Apple. In this week alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">Epic announced a very big judgment against a player</a> who sold illegal Fortnite software. Earlier this month, Fortnite launched a separate lawsuit against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371">a cheat maker and several associates</a>. In other Fortnite news, it appears that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735"> Fortnite Blitz Royale will be remaining</a> through the winter, at least. There's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-squid-game-crossover-skins-and-potential-prices-revealed/1100-6532679/" data-ref-id="1100-6532679">a Fortnite x Squid Game collaboration</a> launching on June 27.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">With Super Smash Bros. Ultimate now nearly four years removed from its final update, the Smash community has had to be creative in getting their fill of new Smash Bros. experiences. One savvy modding team has created Smash Remix--a gigantic content mod for the original Super Smash Bros. on Nintendo 64--and a new trailer has revealed many new features now available in Smash Remix's 2.0 patch.</p><p dir="ltr">The 15-minute trailer highlights two brand-new additions to the Smash Remix roster, as Princess Peach and Crash Bandicoot have joined the fray. A few other faces, like Slippy Toad, Dr. Luigi, and Lanky Kong, have been added to a designated "bonus" slot on the character select screen as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-iLvy0w8hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q-iLvy0w8hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">New arenas are also coming with the 2.0 update, including the Crash Bandicoot-themed Time Twister, as well as Discovery Falls--themed after one of the levels from Dinosaur Planet, the Rare project that eventually became Star Fox Adventures. The patch also brings new items, new game modes like King Of The Hill and Tag Team, the voice acting of original SSB announcer Jeff Manning, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Smash Remix first appeared on the mod scene in May 2019 as version 0.5, with version 1.0 officially launching in September 2021. The mod has seen multiple updates between the 1.0 and 2.0 patches, including 1.1.0 in February 2022 which added Sonic, 1.4.0 in June 2023 which added Goemon, and 1.5.0 in January 2024 which brought Banjo and Kazooie to the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Smash Remix 2.0 is available to <a href="https://smash64.online/remix/" rel="nofollow ">download now</a> for free on the mod team's official website. <a href="https://github.com/JSsixtyfour/smashremix/releases/tag/2.0.0" rel="nofollow ">Patch notes</a> for the 2.0 update can be found on the website as well, with highlights seen below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Smash Remix 2.0 Patch Notes</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Characters  <ul><li dir="ltr">Crash added</li><li dir="ltr">Peach added</li><li dir="ltr">Roy added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Dr. Luigi added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Lanky added to "bonus" slot</li><li dir="ltr">Polygon Crash added</li><li dir="ltr">Polygon Peach added</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Stages  <ul><li dir="ltr">Discovery Falls &amp; Discovery Falls Remix added</li><li dir="ltr">Time Twister added; N.

                <p>Peak has officially become a sleeper hit with gamers. The co-op climbing game recently reached over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">one million sales in under a week</a> and is in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 40 of the most-streamed games</a> of the past few months. The game was created as a partnership between Another Crab's Treasure developer Aggro Crab and Content Warning creators from Landfall, with most of the development taking place during a month-long jam session.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/peak-devs-say-the-hit-comedy-climber-was-pitched-in-a-swedish-hot-tub-and-developed-in-a-frantic-4-week-korean-game-jam-we-brought-our-computers-to-an-airbnb-in-hongdae-and-locked-tf-in-for-a-month/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Aggro Crab studio head Nick Kaman talked about the making of the game and being jealous of Landfall's whirlwind method with Content Warning that he felt "turned everything we know about game development upside-down."</p><p>At the time, Aggro Crab was about to launch its biggest game ever, Another Crab’s Treasure, an intense three-year-plus-long project that he felt burned out his team. "While it was a success, Content Warning was a much bigger one made in much less time," Kaman said via email. Lucky for Kaman's team, there was already an established friendly relationship between the studios, so when he asked if they could join the other team in Seoul, they got an enthusiastic yes.</p><p>"We brought our computers to an Airbnb in Hongdae and locked tf in for a month. As soon as we landed, we beelined straight for the nearest IKEA and spent the day assembling office chairs and desks," Kaman added.</p><p>It should be noted that Peak wasn't built entirely from scratch during those four weeks, as Aggro Crab creative director Caelan Rashby-Pollock had already pitched the idea a year ago in Sweden. "The concept was a lot more vague then and much closer to an open-world survival thingy, but we all quickly got excited about being a group of lost scouts on an island, and the macabre slapstick that can come from that." From there, it was all systems go.</p><p>"Basically, any given moment was either working on Peak or getting food while talking more about Peak," Kaman continued. "While it was pretty intense, it was also the most fun I've ever had working on a game. On a silly multiplayer game like this, the player experience often mirrors the development," Kaman said. "Most of the design was driven by the question: 'Wouldn’t it be funny if <em>this</em> happened?' And now every TikTok I've seen of a great moment in Peak reminds me of the great moment we had while implementing it."</p><p>Peak is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>
