                <p>Black Myth: Wukong, one of 2024's best-selling games worldwide, is finally headed to Xbox after a year of exclusivity on PlayStation. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S on August 20, with preorders opening on June 18.</p><p>The game originally released on PS5 and PC on August 20, 2024, meaning it's coming to Xbox Series X|S precisely one year later. This is fueling the theory that Sony did, in fact, have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-isnt-on-xbox-yet-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-report/1100-6526196/" data-ref-id="1100-6526196">one-year exclusivity deal with developer Game Science.</a></p><p>Some had claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">technical issues with the Xbox Series S</a> prompted a delay for the Xbox version, but Microsoft maintained this was not true (despite the fact that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">some titles have in the past run into issues</a> with the lower-spec version of the newest Xbox).</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on the game's website</a>, Game Science said it took time to bring Black Myth to Xbox because it was "no easy feat" to ensure the experience met the developer's internal expectations. "Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game's official release," the developer said.</p><p>What's more, Game Science has announced the first-ever discount on Black Myth, stating the game will be 20% off beginning June 18 on all platforms. That means Xbox players can preorder the game at a 20% discount, bringing the price down from $60 to about $48.</p><p>Black Myth sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">10 million copies in its first three days</a> and has gone on to shift <a href="https://s3.hatchbuck.com/WebTemplates/5009e2fc130048b2970ee352f5cf59c3.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than 25 million units.</a> At launch, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">overwhelming majority of PC sales on Steam came from China</a>, where its developer is based.

Game Science's guidelines for content creators asked them to avoid discussing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guidelines-ask-content-creators-not-to-discuss-feminist-propaganda-covid-and-more/1100-6525951/" data-ref-id="1100-6525951">"feminist propaganda" and COVID.</a> A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from IGN in 2023</a> documented the alleged sexist and misogynist commentary from the development team.</p><p>If you're just getting started with Black Myth, you can check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-myth-wukong-tips-beginners-guide/2900-5688/" data-ref-id="2900-5688">GameSpot's Black Myth: Wukong guide that runs through 20 things to know before you jump in.</a> We also have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-guides-hub/1100-6525898/" data-ref-id="1100-6525898">dedicated guides hub</a> where you can get all the key info you need.
