                <p dir="ltr">Having made its name with martial arts-based action games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/absolver/" data-ref-id="5000-454945">Absolver</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sifu/" data-ref-id="5000-527647">Sifu</a>, few might have expected Sloclap's next game would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rematch/" data-ref-id="5000-654961">Rematch</a>, an online five-a-side soccer game. After all, while the beautiful game is a beloved pastime and global phenomenon, its representation in video games has long been dominated by the EA FC series (formerly known as FIFA), to the extent that it becomes difficult to consider an alternative.</p><p dir="ltr">But Rematch has one very key difference that I learned during my visit to the studio's Paris office. Where many soccer sims have you in control of a whole team, changing to players closest to where the ball is, Rematch can be better described as a "soccer-player sim" where, in its third-person perspective, the camera is down at pitch level behind your player for the duration of the six-minute match. That also meant that for this hands-on, I was playing with other journalists as my teammates, just like a real game of soccer.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474209" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474209"></a><figcaption>Rematch is a cooperative game that encourages you to work together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474209-ss_406e8029ffdc787ecd8739694c946dd76c54c100.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In explaining the concept, creative director Pierre Tarno speaks of Rematch less in terms of soccer but rather with reference to other genres, such as a third-person action game or even a third-person shooter, since shooting the ball also involves aiming a crosshair with the right stick and squeezing the right trigger. Yet while it's set 40 years in a much more optimistic future, where AR technology can transform the "cages" you play into different environments--from stadiums to rainforests, underwater, or even outer space--the gameplay remains fundamentally real soccer rather than soccer with over-the-top abilities you might expect from Mario Strikers.</p><p dir="ltr">Matches nonetheless take away certain rules that prevent the pace from ever letting up. For instance, there's no offsides, no fouls, and since the ball bounces off the walls of the cage, no throw-ins or corner kicks. While Tarno does show me an early concept trailer where the team had prototyped the ability for players to wall-run along the cage, this one instance of performing impossible feats was ultimately jettisoned.</p><p dir="ltr">"It strayed too far from a credible football fantasy that we were aiming for," he explains. "Football is a simple game and Rematch is a simple game--it's that choreography of bodies and movements which also creates a link with our previous games, which were more about combat. But fundamentally, Rematch is a game of observation and positioning; it's about being at the right time and in the right dynamic."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474211"></a><figcaption>Despite being a simple game, Rematch allows you to pull off complex plays.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474211-ss_e751d318ace64865838880dc103d363f5955258c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What that meant while playing a match was that I was not only in complete control of my player in terms of where they could move around the pitch, but also being responsible for their positioning in receiving or intercepting the ball. Getting the ball was arguably the trickiest part to master in Rematch. That's because there isn't a pass button--a player either performs a ground kick or a shot that is manually aimed. Their teammate can call for the ball, which draws a line so that the player in possession can tell if they're open, but it all comes down to skill in kicking the ball accurately and the other player being in the right position to receive it.</p><p dir="ltr">An even trickier ability to pull off, but one that looks great when you succeed, are volley actions, which can be executed when a diamond appears around an incoming ball. These require precise positioning and super-responsive reactions, but allow you to instantly pass or shoot the ball as soon as it comes to you. It's also contextual based on the height of the ball, so it could result in a header, but in the best-case scenario, a bicycle kick aimed for the corner of the goal.</p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that, only after dabbling with the tutorials before being split up into 4v4 matches, we spent most of our hands-on simply trying to keep possession of the ball rather than pulling off any legendary feats. The difficulty of keeping possession is deliberate in its design, in part to foster team play so that no one will want to hog the ball when it's so easy to get tackled.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474212"></a><figcaption>Teammates rotate positions, giving everyone a chance to play offense and defense.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474212-ss_ecb74312d4bcd03a49529d5d287a76e077aedb41.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are nonetheless useful skills for keeping possession, such as tapping A to "push" the ball away from you, on par with a through-ball, so that you're technically not in possession and therefore not vulnerable to a tackle, or you can perform a more showboating rainbow flick over an enemy player. A sprint boost, or "efforts," is also possible, although this extra gauge takes a while to build back up, so you won't get far if you're attempting to make a dash from your goal to the opposing team's by yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Ultimately, Tarno stresses the importance of team play and passing the ball. Successful passes also earn players points along with other actions like intercepts, which total up at the end of a match to determine the team's MVP. "We want players to feel that joy of playing football with friends, which is a really fun and collective experience that's about putting your team first, and how it can be more satisfying and rewarding to serve the perfect assist than to actually score yourself," he explains.</p><p dir="ltr">That sense of team spirit felt even more true in the second half of our hands-on, when we were joined by dev team members so that it becomes an actual five-a-side game, incidentally also increasing the size of the pitch (at launch, there will be three different pitch sizes for 3v3s, 4v4s, and 5v5s, the latter only marginally smaller than the standard 115-by-74 yards of a real soccer pitch). That is to say that even someone who knows the ins and outs of the game over the past few years of development cannot single-handedly carry the team--they are only as strong as the team playing together.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474215" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474215"></a><figcaption>You can customize your character in Rematch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4474215-ss_bbe8507b799511b9008af67ac5c32115a9765abf.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Having run a number of private tests with players who usually play competitive games like Call of Duty and EA FC, the results have been encouraging too. "By the second, third games, when they're in solo queues with randoms, they're passing the ball, they're not dribbling around everyone and trying to be the hero," Tarno says. "I think it's also because many players have played five-a-side, enjoy football, and know that nobody in football actually dribbles the ball everywhere."</p><p dir="ltr">To help dispel any gym class flashbacks of being picked last and stuck in goal, not only do players rotate positions after every goal, but the keeper is actually an attractive role to take in Rematch. Although the idea is that everything comes down to personal skill rather than individual player stats, keepers have some exceptions that allow them to become sweepers, essentially moving beyond the penalty area as an extra defender. They also benefit from having infinite efforts, so they can dash all the way back to their goal when necessary. When I was a keeper at one point, there was also a moment when an opposing player crossed the ball into the penalty box but it appeared as if the ball's position snapped into my hands, suggesting Sloclap is also preventing keepers from having a case of butter fingers, while other players still need to be precisely positioned to receive or intercept the ball.</p><p dir="ltr">What ultimately convinced me that Rematch is going to be special came in our penultimate match when a last-minute equalizer took us into overtime. There are no draws or penalty shoot-outs: just a single overtime match decided by golden goal rules, and it lasts as long as it takes. Our overtime lasted more than twice as long as a normal match length of six minutes, and by the end I realized I was sweating more profusely than I think I ever had in a competitive game, as if I had just been on the pitch for real, running back and forth, yelling at my teammates for the ball or to take the shot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474204" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4474204"></a><figcaption>In Rematch, you aim and kick the ball with controls that emulate firing a gun in shooters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4474204-ss_f27b62620af398202c73f3f4990a0e3be34bba4b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's exactly the kind of pressure that Sloclap wants players to feel when playing Rematch. Of course, the studio will also be under pressure when it's released as a paid online title. Arguably, its competition isn't really EA's franchise, which has become predominantly about Ultimate Team, but numerous online free-to-play team multiplayer games. As someone who has Rocket League and Overwatch 2 in his regular rotation, Tarno is only too conscious of the competition out there, but he also asserts, "Even if players say, 'An online game should be free-to-play or it's [dead on arrival],' I don't think that's true. If a game is original, solid, and very reasonably priced, players will get it." Take it from me, the sweat was worth it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rematch launches on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 19. An open beta is running April 18-19.</p>

                <p>A icy, post-apocalyptic wasteland and a "life-sustaining" train may evoke Oscar-winning director Bong Joon Ho's film Snowpiercer, but it's also the premise of developer FakeFish's newly revealed FPS survival game, Frostrail.</p><p dir="ltr">In Frostrail, up to four "pilgrims" will cooperate to survive a frozen apocalypse by gathering vital resources and combating "horrifying abominations," according to a press release. At the heart of the experience is the Eden Engine, a train that serves as players' home base as well as a mobile fortress against both monsters and mother nature.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_59w8EP9Qs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/x_59w8EP9Qs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Players will need to gather items from exploring exploring underground dungeons and destroyed ruins in order to craft new tools, weapons, and equipment, all the while battling monsters and surviving the inhospitable cold. Frostrail's reveal trailer highlights the game's weapon crafting, item scavenging, and FPS battles while giving a glimpse at the harsh locales and supernatural foes players will be forced to contend with.</p><p dir="ltr">The goal of Frostrail, according to lead designer Ez Jämsen in a press release, is to take the train far to the north "as an act of penitence and self-preservation," and "embark on a desperate journey alone or with a group where the threats are high, but the experience is unforgettable."</p><p dir="ltr">Though the premise initially sounds a bit like Snowpiercer, it also brings to mind 2019's single player-FPS <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metro-exodus/" data-ref-id="5000-465542">Metro: Exodus</a>, which also revolves around a journey by train through a post-apocalyptic setting, battling monsters and other desperate survivors along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Frostrail will launch on PC in Steam early access sometime in 2026, and is FakeFish's second game following the Finnish studio's founding in 2014. The team previously developed the 2D, co-op submarine simulator <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/barotrauma/" data-ref-id="5000-463872">Barotrauma</a>, which has sold more than 3 million copies since its initial launch in 2019 and is still receiving new content updates.</p>

                <p>Vampire Survivors developer Poncle has officially revealed the next big--and free--update for the game on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, and mobile devices. Shown off during the Triple-I Initiative stream, the Emerald Diorama is based on Square Enix’s fantasy RPG franchise SaGa, and it's now available to download.</p><p>The update adds a lot of new content to Vampire Survivors, including 12 new characters and skins, plenty of new weapons, and the Glimmer gameplay mechanic. Whenever you attack with specific weapons, there's a chance to instantly learn a special technique through this system, allowing you to unleash swords, sorcery, and missiles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS_hntZD318" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jS_hntZD318" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For the new characters, several SaGa protagonists will join the game roster. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido --</strong> A fate-forged master of Kugutsu puppets</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling -- </strong>An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie &amp; Formina -- </strong>A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms</li><li><strong>Diva No.5 -- </strong>A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds--and robotic bodies--in search of her heart</li></ul><p>Poncle says that you can also expect a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies, as well. Some of the other interesting features of this update include a "party" system of sorts for the SaGa crew, and when the health bar for these characters reaches a critically low point, they'll activate their Showstopper ability. This gives the heroes a brief boost to their Might, Luck, and Cooldown stats.</p><p>The action will also unfold on a new SaGa-inspired stage and there'll be several remixes of classic Saga tracks to listen to while you mow down hundreds of monsters.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legal-issue-preventing-vampire-survivors-from-getting-cross-save-on-playstation-consoles/1100-6530692/">Cross-save support is also headed to Vampire Survivors</a>, but not to PlayStation consoles due to a legal issue. Poncle cited privacy issues as the reason why cross-save will not be available on PS4 and PS5, and the developers says that chances of it coming to those consoles remain "slim" for now.</p>

                <p>During the Triple-I Initiative, developer 11 Bit Studios announced that sci-fi game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-alters/" data-ref-id="5000-566112">The Alters</a> will launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 13. The game will also be a day-one launch on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> for Xbox and PC.</p><p>In case you missed it when it was first announced, The Alters puts you in the boots of Jan Dolski, the lone survivor of a space expedition that ended with his spaceship crash-landing on a hostile planet. Making his way to a mobile base, Jan quickly learns that he has three days to get it moving again before the planet's next sunrise incinerates it and him. The big problem? A lack of human and mineral resources to get the base on the move again. Fortunately, Jan can clone himself, but each new "Alter" represents an alternate version of himself shaped by different choices in his life.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF48QDkg3Cw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WF48QDkg3Cw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The more Alters you have, the better your odds of survival will be, but the challenge lies in managing a group of Jans who have unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. Players will also need to focus on managing their mobile base and dealing with the hazards of the world around them, as the game is a combination of survival, base-building, and exploration.</p><p>"Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-alters-is-an-ambitious-genre-blending-survival-game/1100-6523693/" data-ref-id="1100-6523693">The Alters preview</a>. "No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special."</p><p>The Alters release date puts it in an interesting spot on the gaming calendar. It'll be arriving not long after the global launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and the month also has other games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-launches-in-june/1100-6529987/" data-ref-id="1100-6529987">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2s-long-awaited-nightdive-studios-remaster-has-a-new-name/1100-6529509/" data-ref-id="1100-6529509">System Shock 2 remaster</a>.</p>

Now, Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core is moving closer to fruition with a new trailer and an announcement that a closed alpha test for the game will begin soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EfBOHWeaSo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-EfBOHWeaSo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rogue Core casts one to four players as intergalactic dwarves who are battle-hardened Reclaimers. These are the warrior dwarves who are called upon to investigate the mines of Hoxxes IV after several dwarf dig spaces went offline. The Core Spawn within the planet have proven to be deadly to the previous miners, and the Reclaimers will have to overcome the native creatures to claim the powerful new material known as Expenite.</p><p>Each play through allows the team to explore procedurally generated stages and search for elements and resources to complete their missions. The game is also introducing new classes of dwarves, including Guardians who protect the team, Spotters who can identify threats, Slicers who excel in battle during full-frontal assaults, and Falconeers who fight alongside a robotic bird of prey.</p><p>Players can harvest Expenite for temporary upgrades, but they can also permanently unlock upgrades by returning to their ship and conducting research to refresh their arsenal.</p><p>Rogue Core's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page is now active</a>, and players are invited to go there to express their interest in the closed alpha test. For now, neither the closed alpha test nor the release window for the game have been given firm dates.</p>
