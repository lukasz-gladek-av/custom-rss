                <p>Nintendo has added a new batch of classic games for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers. Three more Sega Genesis titles are now available to play through the service: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/streets-of-rage-1991/" data-ref-id="5000-3191">Streets of Rage</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-thunder-blade/" data-ref-id="5000-16439">Super Thunder Blade</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/eswat-city-under-siege/" data-ref-id="5000-8653">ESWAT: City Under Siege</a>.</p><p>The Sega Genesis classics library is available exclusively as part of Nintendo Switch Online's Expansion Pack plan. This premium tier includes all of the benefits of the base Switch Online service, as well as access to classic Nintendo 64 and Game Boy Advance games, plus select DLC such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons/" data-ref-id="5000-487113">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' Happy Home Paradise expansion.</p><p>The base Nintendo Switch Online plan costs $20 per year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 per year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Nintendo routinely expands Switch Online's offerings with new features and titles. Back in February, the company added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-nintendos-weirder-games-is-coming-to-switch-online-this-month/1100-6529318/" data-ref-id="1100-6529318">Wario Land 4</a> to the Game Boy Advance library, while Game Boy classics Donkey Kong '94 and Mario's Picross were added in March.</p><p>The service will continue to expand on Switch 2. In addition to the current array of classic titles, Expansion Pack members will also have access to GameCube games on the new console. Three titles (The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, SoulCalibur II, and F-Zero GX) will initially be available at launch, with other classics like Super Mario Sunshine, Luigi's Mansion, and Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance slated to follow in the future.</p><p>Switch Online members will also be able to take advantage of one of Switch 2's major new features: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/" data-ref-id="1100-6530539">GameChat</a>, which allows players to easily talk with friends and share their screen while playing together in group sessions. All Switch 2 owners will be able to try GameChat for free through March 2026, after which it will only be accessible with a Switch Online membership.</p>

                <p>Publisher 2K and developer Hangar 13 have seemingly revealed that Mafia: The Old Country will launch on August 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/mafia-the-old-country-launches-august-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>, 2K and Hangar 13 posted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/592894082264596999" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam blog post</a> detailing their plans for PAX East 2025.

                <p>No one is doing more for mascot platformers than Toys for Bob. Since 2018, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">formerly Microsoft-owned studio</a> has released the Spyro Reignited Trilogy, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot 4, and Crash Team Rumble, reinvigorating two beloved but largely stagnant franchises. Now, Toys for Bob co-studio head and creative director Paul Yan says the studio has its eyes on another iconic platforming series: Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CanadianGuyE</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CanadianGuyEh" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">h</a>--which was then reported by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/since-going-independent-of-activision-microsoft-and-xbox-studio-toys-for-bob-says-theyd-love-to-work-on-a-banjo-kazooie-in-a-new-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>--Yan discussed Toys for Bob's upcoming projects. On top of seemingly teasing a new entry in the Spyro the Dragon series, Yan expressed the team's desire to work with Xbox on bringing back the dynamic bird and bear duo, Banjo-Kazooie.</p><p>"One company we'd like to work with is one we're already working with--Team Xbox! They've been a great partner and they also have a very interesting roster of characters that Toys for Bob could have a lot of fun with. The honey bear is the first one that comes to mind--I think we can all agree Banjo's been hibernating long enough, right?" Yan said.</p><p>Though this certainly doesn't mean a Banjo-Kazooie remake or reboot is already in the works, Toys for Bob's past work and relationship with Xbox makes this collaboration seem more like a matter of "when" than "if." Despite the studio breaking apart from the Microsoft-owned studio Activision back in 2023, it has continued to work closely with Xbox, and is currently collaborating with the company on an upcoming project that many <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/spyro-4-rumours-toys-for-bob-tease/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">speculate to be Spyro the Dragon 4</a>. Though Yan said he "can't spill the beans just yet" on the upcoming project, he assured fans that development is going well.</p><p>"I will say that we're very much in the thick of development. The team is very thrilled about how the experience is shaping up. This game is big and ambitious and pushes our craft to new heights."</p><p>Prior to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-4-studio-toys-for-bob-goes-independent-from-microsoft/1100-6521496/" data-ref-id="1100-6521496">leaving Activision</a>, Toys for Bob had been moved from working on the whimsical platformers it's known for to assist the Call of Duty series as a support studio. According to a former senior concept artist, Nicholas Kole, the team was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crash-bandicoot-artist-says-fifth-game-was-canceled/1100-6524957/" data-ref-id="1100-6524957">forced to scrap Crash Bandicoot 5</a>. After 86 employees were laid off from the studio as a part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">Microsoft's 2023 mass layoffs</a>, the studio sought, and was given, independence.</p>
