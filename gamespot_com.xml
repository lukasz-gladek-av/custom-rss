                <p>One of the biggest surprises of 2025 was Microsoft's push to bring even more of its games to PlayStation, its longtime rival in the console gaming space. Not only have those ports been well received, but they've also been best-sellers, and next year will see the arrival of Halo and Forza Horizon on PlayStation. In a new interview, Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, spoke about the success of Xbox games on PS5 and the reaction to Halo's announcement for PS5.</p><p>"We had a bit of a moment earlier in the summer from end of April to end of June, where we had six of the top 10 games on PlayStation were our Xbox games," Booty said to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>. "I look at that as validation for the teams, but most importantly, it's an opportunity for more players to engage with our content, to come into our worlds."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Campaign Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Halo has long been considered the crown jewel of Xbox, and the next game in the franchise, a campaign-only remake of the original titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6535992/">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, will launch simultaneously on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026. Booty said the announcement was well received and that Microsoft was really pleased with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-on-ps5-is-a-win-for-the-future-of-halo-dev-says/1100-6535726/">efforts to bring its content to more people</a>.</p><p>Booty also touched on several other topics in the interview, like Microsoft's u-turn on charging $80 for new games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-reacts-to-dropping-plans-for-80-games/1100-6536931/">suggesting a more dynamic approach</a> to video game monetization in the future. The Xbox Game Studios boss also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-were-significantly-down-from-black-ops-6-report/1100-6536893/">disappointing reception to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> and the challenges of releasing a new Call of Duty game every year.</p><p>Activision has also pledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">not to do back-to-back entries in the same Call of Duty sub-series like Modern Warfare or Black Ops</a>, and it aims to deliver "meaningful, not incremental" innovation going forward.</p>

                <p>One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025s-biggest-gaming-news-banned-games-gta-6-delayed-price-hikes/2900-7312/" data-ref-id="2900-7312">biggest pieces of news in gaming this year</a> was EA's announcement that it was selling itself for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">$55 billion</a> to investors including Saudi Arabia. The announcement of the deal has sent shockwaves through the gaming world, and now Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty has commented on the deal, saying the price tag reflects how big video games have come in the global media landscape.</p><p>"Games have really become a foundational part of entertainment," <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Booty told Variety</a>. "And as such, I think we're seeing these valuations and transactions that really reflect their place in modern entertainment."</p><p>The price of the sale "reflects the value that exists in all of" the gaming IP that EA owns, including Madden, FC, and The Sims, Booty said.</p><p>"I'm certainly not [a mergers and acquisition] expert, but I would look at the value of the transaction really being about the forward-looking value of the IP and the stories and what they've created, even more so than necessarily, the static or rearward-looking value," he said.</p><p>Microsoft is no stranger to big buyouts, as the company purchased Mojang and Minecraft for $2.5 billion, ZeniMax for $7.5 billion, and Activision Blizzard for $75.4 billion.</p><p>The $55 billion would take EA private as part of the biggest Leveraged Buyout (LBO) in history. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/majority-control-of-ea-could-shift-to-saudi-arabias-public-investment-fund-report/1100-6536660/" data-ref-id="1100-6536660">take more than 93% ownership of EA</a> if the deal closes, with Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners and Silver Lake taking the rest.</p><p>EA would also be responsible for coming up with $20 billion in the deal, and this has prompted concerns that EA will look to cut costs with layoffs, studio closures, and by selling off assets.</p><p>EA's sale has not been completed, but it's expected to close in 2026, pending regulatory approval and other closing conditions. A group of EA workers has criticized the sale, saying it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">unnecessary and harmful to workers.</a> People have expressed concerns that the PIF will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/">seek to avoid "the gay stuff" and politics</a> if the deal materializes. For its part, EA has acknowledged that its ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">attract, retain, and motivate developers may be negatively affected</a> by the pending sale.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-55-billion-buys-everything-included-in-the-ea-acquisition/1100-6535111/" data-ref-id="1100-6535111">all the EA franchises that would be sold if the deal closes.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it would start charging $80 for new games, beginning with The Outer Worlds 2. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">backtracked on those plans</a>, however, opting to sell the game for $70 and cancelling plans for other $80 games in the future. What happened here? And what does Microsoft think about pricing for its games going forward?</p><p>Head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that the decision to roll back prices from $80 to $70 came about from listening to player feedback and trying to deliver "player value."</p><p>"We've reacted in the last year and I think for us, the real focus is going to be ... meeting people where they are. I think there's going to be less of a focus on what's that top line price of a game, as people start to engage in different ways with games," he said.</p><p>Thinking about a set price like $50, $60, $70, $80, or more is missing the point, Booty said. There is no one-size-fits-all approach for pricing, and Booty said the company will continue to monitor feedback as it looks to set prices for games in the future.</p><p>"From our point of view, monetization just happens in so many different ways right now. So we're going to continue to listen to the feedback from fans. We're going to continue, to balance that with needing to run the healthy business. But right now, on the content side, we don't have any pricing updates," he said.</p><p>While Microsoft didn't end up releasing any $80 games this year, the company did hike prices for Xbox fans in other ways. Microsoft jacked up Xbox console prices and increased the monthly cost of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by a whopping 50%.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, and the company says the game has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">so much value that it justifies the higher cost</a>. The game is also available in a $500 hardware bundle, however.</p><p>Looking further out, many are wondering what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> will cost when it releases in November 2026.

                <p>The Switch 2 is a fun console, but one of its shortcomings is that it's not the most ergonomic device for handheld play. That's where CRKD is looking to <em>switch </em>things up, as the company has announced the Nitro Deck 2 for Switch 2 consoles. Even better, it's compatible with the Switch 1 and is scheduled to launch in Spring 2026 in two colorways: White and Smoke Black. Pricing for these have not yet been revealed.</p><div title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5243" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536927 -- CRKD Nitro Deck 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">CRKD Nitro Deck 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/crkd.gg\/products\/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://crkd.gg/products/nitro-deck-2-smoke-black-edition">Releases Spring 2026</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the original Nitro Deck, the Nitro Deck 2 is designed to be an all-in-one add-on to the Switch 2. The cradle uses a retractable locking mechanism to ensure a tight fit with Switch consoles, and it replaces the Joy-Cons on the sides. The built-in controllers are contoured to fit more naturally in your hands, and they feature an offset right thumbstick for a more ergonomic feel. The console tablet is now held in place with a retractable locking dial located on the rear. It also comes with a legacy adapter for Switch 1 and Switch OLED consoles, as well as another adapter to enable low-latency wired handheld play.</p><p>The capsticks on this model aren't Hall Effect sticks, but CRKD claims they can deliver ultra-responsive control, adjustable resistance, and immunity to magnetic interference thanks to a zero-contact design. Programmable back buttons can also be found on the rear of the Nitro Deck 2, which have been expanded to include L2 and R2 buttons. You can also customize the joysticks with swappable tops, and the triggers have been upgraded to tactile Digital Triggers. The cradle is rounded off with a durable metal kickstand and motion control compatibility.</p><p>When not in use with a Switch console, it can be used as a wireless or wired controller for PC, mobile devices, and smart TVs.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621687"></a><figcaption>CRKD Nitro Deck 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4621687-nitro-deck.jpg"></figure><p>If you're looking to get something right away for your Switch 1 console, the current <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/9A65AE84-0112-4BBA-8228-D36D2EDDC47A?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CRKD Nitro Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/570556D9-ED67-42E7-88BC-DD0885AF34EC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nitro Deck+</a> come highly recommended. These are priced from around $50 - $60 each, and they come in a wide variety of colors like black, PAL grey, and a retro-inspired purple. The regular Nitro Deck features full-size Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, motion controls, rumble, turbo function, curved handles, and is compatible with both the standard and OLED Switch models.</p><p>The Nitro Deck+ has a similar setup, but the key differences with this model include HDMI out support via the USB-C port so that you can put the Switch in docked mode without having to remove it from the cradle, a symmetrical thumbstick layout, an eject function to make removing the screen easier, and improved rumble effects.</p><h3>Nitro Deck</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-Professional-Handheld-Nintendo/dp/B0CFLVJBBD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DV5MY5R2?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cuddle Team Leader: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $42.49 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG4WPDL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PAL Grey</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CSG44TGV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Pink</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0FQ5S7L7N?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Retro Purple</a> -- $43 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0DHVN8GXX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League Silver Edition</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com//dp/B0CGMGLHG1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $60</li></ul><h3>Nitro Deck+</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2MDC8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8YGPT3G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear Black )with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0CZY2J5HN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White</a> -- $60</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/CRKD-Nitro-Deck-HDMI-Adapter-Programmable/dp/B0D8ZR8WCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Clear White (with HDMI adapter)</a> -- $50 (<del>$70</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nitro-Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Model/dp/B0DV5LL71D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Renegade Raider: Fortnite Edition</a> -- $47 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Gaming-Console/dp/B0DHVW45YJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rocket League: Gold Edition</a> -- $43 (<del>$55</del>)</li></ul><p>Several other third-party Switch 2 controllers are also on sale on Amazon right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The GameSir G8 Plus</a> features an extendable bridge that can cradle a Switch 2 and small tablets, and its traditional controller design makes it comfortable to use.
