          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mafia: The Old Country - “Whatever it Takes” Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"We think there's a large audience for compelling stories that don't require massive time commitments," 2K President David Ismailer said in a press release. "We're excited to offer a game like Mafia: The Old Country in our portfolio, and to provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis."</p><p>This is a notable development considering many games and publishers have leaned into bigger open-world designs that require significant time investments to play and enjoy. These might be referred to as "lifestyle" games. Players have so far generally responded positively to the news that Mafia: The Old Country is taking a different approach, but of course, it's still early days.</p><p>The $60 Deluxe edition includes a range of bonus items, including special guns, outfits, and accessories, along with the game's score and a digital artbook. Everyone who preorders The Old Country gets the Soldato Pack, which includes various cosmetics.</p><p>The Old Country takes place in 1900s Sicily, with players taking on the role of mobster Enzo Favara. 2K says the game will play out like a "classic mob movie," featuring a "cast of unpredictable allies and cutthroat enemies." In terms of combat, players will shoot and stab people with knives and shotguns, while players can traverse the Sicilian countryside on horseback or in cars.</p><p>The Old Country launches on August 8 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll be followed by another big 2K game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a>, in September.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Paradox Interactive has finally confirmed that its Tinto studio's Project Caesar, which it had been teasing through a series of <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forums/tinto-talks.1171/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dev diary posts</a> on its forum, is Europa Universalis V. As the first new entry in this series in nearly 12 years and one releasing in a very different landscape for strategy games, questions arise about what will, or should, change. Paradox's answer is to simply rework and tweak a formula that has proven to work well, rather than changing everything to court new players.</p><p>I attended a digital preview event for Europa Universalis V and went hands-on with an early build of the real-time strategy game ahead of the announcement. I found that its biggest changes didn't address approachability--which you might think would be the primary focus to attract newcomers to the franchise--but instead added strategic depth. Europa Universalis V feels distinct from what came before, but it doesn't lose any of the series' identity and focus on complexity. This might be the most hardcore grand strategy game in Paradox's catalog.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKaGSIm9juI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MKaGSIm9juI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>All of the government, military, and economic strategy systems that the series is known for return in this latest entry, working in tandem to create a complex political climate that grows from the in-game starting point of 1337. Players take control of any nation they want from around the world and micromanage nearly every aspect of it. Grand strategy games are overwhelming in the amount of information and strategic options they present players, but become outstanding sandboxes for emergent storytelling once you know where to look and what to do--Europa Universalis V is no different.</p><p>Declaring war on a small neighboring country as Naples, only to get massive swaths of my territory annexed by France's army because I didn't notice the country I was attacking was their ally, was a frustrating moment. But it’s also one I won’t soon forget because it reminded me to pay closer attention to every little political detail Europa Universalis V offers and informed the rest of my play time as Naples. It was the kind of strategic mistake I won’t soon forget, as its fallout informed a non-negligible part of my country’s history.</p><p>The biggest hurdle Paradox will encounter with Europa Universalis V is encouraging players to upgrade to it. Every time Paradox releases a new game in one of its grand strategy series, it's asking players to move away from games they've spent potentially thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars on.</p><p>Ultimately, Paradox believes that the appeal of an upgrade to Europa Universalis V comes from the new gameplay changes. When asked why players should upgrade, game director Johan Andersson said he believes Europa Universalis V has "more mechanics" and "more content" than its predecessor, making the upgrade worthwhile. That answer once again stresses that mechanical depth is this strategy game's biggest draw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489856"></a><figcaption>This screenshot from the start of The Age of Discovery shows just how much information Europa Universalis V makes players account for.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489856-3.jpg"></figure><p>Some of these gameplay evolutions are influenced by other Paradox grand strategy games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/victoria-3/" data-ref-id="5000-532092">Victoria 3</a>. For example, the population of Europa Universalis V's provinces is now split into population units, each of which can have different cultural, religious, and economic demands and preferences. Keeping everyone as happy as possible is key to keeping a nation stable, but that's easier said than done. There are also now more minutiae in the goods each province can produce, so players have to be more aware of whether they have a surplus of goods or if they have enough proper trade routes.</p><p>Europa Universalis V also goes back to the series' roots in different ways. First, it removes mana as a mechanic, which restricted when and how players could perform actions. Secondly, it brings back the policy sliders from the first three games in the series, providing a clearer indication of where one's nation stands in relation to different political values. All of these new systems and returning gameplay features give Europa Universalis V a clear identity of its own, if you know where to look.</p><p>And that identity is as a hardcore strategy game. Andersson outright called it "the most grand game we've ever made." Those hardcore fans are the ones most likely to appreciate all of the tweaks Paradox has made to the core of the Europa Universalis formula. But if you're someone who was hoping the next Europa Universalis would strip back complexity to make it more approachable, that's certainly not the case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857" data-ratio="0.5619295958279" data-width="3835" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4489857"></a><figcaption>A clearer look at the world map in Europa Universalis V. Keep in mind that you can also play as countries outside of Europe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4489857-1.jpg"></figure><p>The one addition that will make Europa Universalis V a little more approachable is its automation system. It allows players to automate tasks related to the conquerer, explorer, trader, and gardener play styles. By using this feature, players can focus on specific parts of the game, whether for educational or entertainment purposes.</p><p>This approach doesn't sacrifice depth for the sake of approachability, as your best option will still be to manage everything yourself. Still, new players may want to automate certain tasks at first while getting used to all the changes and mechanics that Europa Universalis V introduces. As has historically been the case with Paradox Interactive's grand strategy games, Europa Universalis V is overwhelming at first, but captivating once you get a handle on everything going on. In this way, it doesn't sacrifice the series' identity, but the culmination of all the Paradox grand strategy games that came before it ensures the experience doubles down on the strategic complexity. As a strategy game fan, I love it--I'll take all the mechanical depth and complexity I can get.</p><p>Europa Universalis V does not balk at the challenge of offering a comprehensive grand strategy for its players, simply offering tools like automation so players can ease themselves into everything bit by bit. Although it may be tough for some to move on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/europa-universalis-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-149860">Europa Universalis IV</a>, a game with over 12 years of updates and DLC, those who make the jump will discover what's shaping up to be the next great grand strategy sandbox from Paradox.</p>

Titan Quest 2 missing that timeframe came from Grimoire Games wanting to avoid a "crowded ARPG release window and a desire to give the game the spotlight it deserves," according to a press release. A specific early-access release date was not given.</p>

<p dir="ltr">For context, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> Vessel of Hatred expansion launched in October 2024 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-passes-over-1-million-early-access-players-dev-warns-of-server-struggles/1100-6528281/" data-ref-id="1100-6528281">Path of Exile 2 launched in early access</a> just a few months later in December. That would have definitely made it difficult for Titan Quest 2 to stand out among the two biggest names in the ARPG genre.</p><p dir="ltr">Grimoire Games, alongside the new release window, also outlined areas where players can expect changes and improvements ahead of early access based on feedback from recent playtests. That list of areas needing "refinement," according to a press release, are combat fluidity, ability aiming, game balance, and performance optimization. The team will additionally add new customizable control schemes and better UI indicators based on player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">Like its 2006 predecessor, Titan Quest 2 will drop players into ancient Greece to battle against mythological foes like Gryphons, Harpies, and Centaurs, this time on a quest to stop the goddess Nemesis from corrupting the Threads of Fate and condemning all who oppose her. Players will be able to choose from different combat masteries and combine two of them to create unique builds, with Titan Quest 2 aiming to be a challenging ARPG experience that will require players to dodge and use every skill at their disposal to overcome foes. The game will also feature crafting, allowing players to turn what normally would not be a great item into a more powerful one by adding affixes.</p><p dir="ltr">In other ARPG news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-season-8-is-making-endgame-bosses-stronger-simpler-to-access-and-more-rewarding/1100-6530970/" data-ref-id="1100-6530970">Diablo 4 Season 8 just began</a>, revamping its endgame boss system and introducing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/" data-ref-id="1100-6530989">Berserk crossover</a>, while developer Grinding Gear Games has been hard at work addressing complaints in regards to an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-devs-respond-to-unpopular-update-there-were-some-blatant-f-ups/1100-6530736/" data-ref-id="1100-6530736">unpopular major update to Path of Exile 2</a>.</p>
