                <p>Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade will release on Nintendo Switch 2 as one of many third-party games announced for the console.</p><p>As of writing, specific details are scant. There is no price point or release date for the game's Switch 2 port. In a short video segment, which was part of the April Nintendo Direct, Square Enix director Naoki Hamaguchi promised "more updates on the Final Fantasy VII Remake project for Switch 2." What exactly this statement means is unknown. Perhaps the sequel, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, will also see a Switch 2 port. The aforementioned video segment showed off a couple early portions of the game, with principle characters Cloud and Barrett fighting robots. Other third-party games releasing on the Switch 2 include Elden Ring, Cyberpunk 2077, Sid Meier's Civilization VII, and Borderlands 4.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrXgnDfqP4Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YrXgnDfqP4Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For anyone unaware, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-yuffie-episode-ps5-upgrade-detailed/1100-6488309/" data-ref-id="1100-6488309">Final Fantasy Remake Intergrade</a> originally released in 2021 as a PC port and PS5 upgrade for the erstwhile PS4 exclusive. It improved graphical features and added a mini-story featuring party member Yuffie. Final Fantasy Remake is a partial remake of the classic game, covering the party's journey through the city of Midgar.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 news, the newest Mario Kart game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-officially-confirmed-for-switch-2-as-mario-kart-world/1100-6530411/" data-ref-id="1100-6530411">Mario Kart World is priced at $80</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">The console itself</a> will run for $450.

                <p>Nintendo has confirmed that it explored "a lot of ideas" for what to called the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> before landing on that name. In an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask the Developer interview published on Nintendo's website</a>, Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto said Nintendo's teams had a difficult time coming up with a name for the console.</p><p>"There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one," he said.</p><p>One of the ideas that Nintendo considered was "Super Nintendo Switch." Nintendo decided against this, however, because it "didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as the Super NES."</p><p>"Switch 2 is a new system with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs, but rather to think of it as the latest system developed by Nintendo," Kawamoto said. "So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2."</p><p>The Switch 2's development director, Takuhiro Dohta, went on to say that the Switch 2 is not aimed at people who prefer "high-performance hardware," but instead its ambition is to be a product that can appeal to the widest possible audience. "So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest system," Dohta said.</p><p>Another Switch 2 designer, Tetsuya Sasaki, said the name "Switch 2" is "simple and easy to understand." Sasaki added that it was always the plan for the system to be a "proper successor to Switch," so keeping the same name made sense.</p><p>Dohta, meanwhile, added that the teams had "lots of back and forth" about what to call the Switch 2, but in the end, they came together and "agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all."</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">priced at $450 and scaling to $500</a> for a bundle that includes a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>.
