                <p>Between massive open-world games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elden-ring-review-death-of-the-wild/1900-6417832/" data-ref-id="1900-6417832">Elden Ring</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, or live-service titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-season-1-start-date-new-heroes-new-map-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-6101/" data-ref-id="2900-6101">Marvel Rivals</a>, there are no shortage of games that can eat up players' free time. And that's why the industry may have reached a tipping point with its seemingly endless games, according to Bethesda veteran Will Shen.</p><p>Shen--who was previously the lead quest designer on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">Starfield</a>--recently shared his thoughts about players being put off from jumping into large games during his appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCYpt9Zg7cM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kiwi Talkz</a>. He accepted that some of his previous Bethesda titles, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review/1900-6344622/" data-ref-id="1900-6344622">Skyrim</a>, which "you can play pretty much forever, " may have contributed to player fatigue. However, Shen contends that the oversaturation of giant games leaves players without enough time to fully invest in new titles.</p><p>"We're reaching a point where people are fatigued, or a large section, a growing section of the audience, is becoming fatigued at investing 30-plus, 100-plus hours into a game," explained Shen. "Because they already have that. They already have the games that they will continually come back to, and adding another one to that list is a tall order. It's always a tall order."</p><p>Shen pointed to the success of shorter games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">Astro Bot</a> and Mouthwashing as titles that can be easily enjoyed by players without having to invest massive of amounts of time. He also suggested that the short length of those games allows more players to create a community around them because they've all been able "to engage fully with the entirety of the product."</p><p>The long AAA titles go hand-in-hand with the escalating budgets for video games. Naughty Dog co-founder Andy Gavin recently revealed that one of the reasons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-founder-reveals-budgets-of-original-games-and-why-they-sold-to-sony/1100-6528634/" data-ref-id="1100-6528634">he agreed to sell his company to Sony</a> was to prevent the massive development costs from sinking everything he and his team had built prior to 2001. Those rising expenses also contributed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">to the devastating job losses</a> in the video game industry last year.</p>

                <p>What happens when you install nearly every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> Classic add-on all at once? A cacophony of nonsensical sounds, the most cluttered interface imaginable, and, ultimately, the game ceasing to function entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">User-made add-ons are a big part of WoW, enabling players to customize their UI and tailor their experience how they like. WoW Classic, in particular, benefits greatly from add-ons, adding quality-of-life features that make playing the old-school version of Blizzard's MMORPG more manageable.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRbVTm-VDdc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cRbVTm-VDdc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">There are over 3,800 WoW Classic add-ons available for download on Curseforge, a website and app many WoW players use to manage their add-ons. Recently, one user by the name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BALTOBOULBOBBI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baltoboulbobbi</a> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/what-happens-if-you-install-every-wow-classic-addon-358339" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">(via Wowhead)</a> took it on themselves to see what exactly would happen if they tried to play the game with every add-on installed all at the same time. The brave soul installed 3,703 WoW Classic add-ons all at once and documented their experience in a seven minute video that is equal parts hilarious and existential nightmare. Some add-ons had to be immediately disabled due to them pushing Baltoboulbobbi over their 16GB RAM limit, while others had to be turned off as they prevented the game from running entirely. That left them with 3,683 add-ons running at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Things instantly get out of hand. Immediately upon logging in, they first attempt to click out of as many windows obstructing their view as possible, only to discover over 100 add-ons in the middle of the screen that can't be removed. Much of the screen is occupied by various menus, health bars, and charts. Nearly every action they take is accompanied by random sounds, ranging from farts, quotes from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Shobek" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic streamer Shobek</a>, or cries of "Finish Him!" ripped Mortal Kombat. Leveling up is even more outrageous. Overall, Baltoboulbobbi is able to level up a few times and complete a few quests before the game crashes, putting an end to the ambitious experiment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423239"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at Baltoboulbobbi's user interface upon booting up WoW Classic with 3,683 add-ons running.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4423239-wowclassicalladdonsinstalled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the comments, Baltoboulbobbi pledged to attempt to do a 1-60 leveling challenge on WoW Classic's Hardcore permadeath server with all add-ons installed if their video eclipsed more than 20,000 views. The video has now been viewed more than 100,000 times, and Baltoboulbobbi has made good on their promise, having done several live streamed sessions of them attempting the feat so far.</p><p dir="ltr">What's even scarier is that while Baltoboulbobbi nearly installed every WoW Classic add-on available, there are far, far more add-ons available for download for the modern version of WoW. According to CurseForge, there are over 10,000 add-ons for WoW's current The War Within expansion, and one shutters at the thought of what would happen were someone to try and run them all at once.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-is-finally-getting-fresh-servers-as-cataclysm-players-move-to-pandaria/1100-6527720/" data-ref-id="1100-6527720">WoW Classic recently received fresh servers in celebration of the game's 20th anniversary</a>. Blizzard also announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing will finally be coming to WoW alongside the game's Midnight expansion</a>, though the expansion sadly doesn't yet have a release date.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/">Minecraft</a> creator Markus "Notch" Persson says he's hoping to start work on a new game that would serve as a "spiritual successor" to the block-based sandbox game he first created in 2009.</p><p dir="ltr">"I basically announced Minecraft 2," Persson tweeted shortly after <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617" rel="nofollow ">posting a poll</a> asking for players' opinions on the direction of his current project, which he says is "a traditional roguelike mixed with a tile-based first-person dungeon-crawler."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I basically announced minecraft 2.<br>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.<br>I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know…</p>  — notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"But then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia, and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash," Persson wrote in a post sharing the poll.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Minecraft fans went wild, and when asked to elaborate, Persson confirmed he was <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875225803220512852" rel="nofollow ">"100% serious" about a sequel</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I thought that maybe people actually do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again," Persson wrote. "I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite clearly being passionate about the idea, Persson was just as eager to share his fears regarding the ways a Minecraft sequel could potentially go wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it," he said. "Saying that, spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic. [These are] the things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway, and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even <em>more</em> cash for?"</p><p dir="ltr">Persson added that he'd want any profit made from a potential Minecraft sequel to be "spent for good [things]," adding that despite Minecraft's popularity and success, the game has also taught him a lot about failure. "Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed," he wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">Before signing off, Perrson stated that he had no intention to "sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing [with Minecraft] and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft sh*ttification about."</p><p dir="ltr">"I respect them for doing that," Persson said of Microsoft, which purchased Minecraft in 2014. "It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me."</p><p dir="ltr">In the years since the acquisition, Microsoft has expanded the franchise with spin-offs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/minecraft-legends-review-tides-of-war/1900-6418057/">Minecraft Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft-dungeons/">Minecraft Dungeons</a>. As for the possibility of a sequel, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in the wake of the 2014 buyout that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-talks-minecraft-buyout-possibility-of-mi/1100-6423159/">focused first and foremost on improving the original game</a>, rather than looking toward a sequel. In 2015, Mojang CEO Jonas Martensson said there were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-2-not-happening-anytime-soon/1100-6429533/">"no discussions [happening] about Minecraft 2 at the moment,"</a> but neither Microsoft nor Mojang have ever said that a sequel was entirely off the table.</p><p>Persson hasn't yet shared any glimpses of his current work with players, so there's no telling what a Minecraft 2 might look like, though one imagines it would share its predecessor's cube-covered art style. In addition to a potential playable sequel, Minecraft fans also have a block-based blockbuster to look forward to, with A Minecraft Movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-trailer-for-a-minecraft-movie-provides-a-deeper-look-at-the-block-based-blockbuster/1100-6527875/">set to hit theaters in April</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is continuing to expand Xbox Game Pass, with new LG Smart TVs coming later this year set to support the service via Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox App on their new LG TV, no Xbox required. A select few games, around 50, will also be streamable via the new LG TVs for Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who own them. Microsoft announced the ability to stream owned games in November, with titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hogwarts-legacy/" data-ref-id="5000-519019">NBA 2K25, Hogwarts Legacy</a>, and others supporting the feature. </p><p dir="ltr">Currently, those looking to stream Xbox Game Pass titles without an actual console or PC can do so via their phone, Amazon Fire TV, or on newer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-support-coming-to-2021-samsung-smart-tvs/1100-6509215/" data-ref-id="1100-6509215">Samsung Smart TVs</a>. Microsoft said in a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> it will reveal more details about how the service will work on LG Tvs "in the coming months." It's currently unclear if support for the service will eventually come to some older LG TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Game Pass heading to LG TVs comes as part of Microsoft's recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">"This is an Xbox" marketing campaign</a>, where the company has looked to expand the idea of what it means to play on Xbox by highlighting how players can play "Xbox" on their PC, phones, or even TVs.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a message Microsoft has been using for a while now. In 2020, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-explains-why-microsoft-doesnt-need-you-to-buy-a-new-xbox-this-holiday/1100-6483787/" data-ref-id="1100-6483787">the goal was to increase the number of people playing on Xbox</a>, but that didn't necessarily mean selling more consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">"It means somebody who is logging in and playing a part of our ecosystem, whether first-party or third-party. And it could be an Android phone. It could be on a Switch. It could be on a PC. That's how we think about it," Spencer said.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to allowing players to stream Xbox Game Pass titles from a variety of devices, Microsoft has continued to offer many of its first-party titles on competing platforms. Xbox's most recent big console exclusive, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">coming to PlayStation 5 in the spring</a>.</p>

                <p>An update for the first Destiny game surprisingly appeared on January 5, leaving players baffled. The game's headquarters, called the Tower, all of sudden became covered in holiday decorations.</p><p>This event in the Destiny universe is called The Dawning, which is the game's version of Christmas. Players were puzzled as to why The Dawning returned to the first Destiny game, considering that developer Bungie stopped supporting it after Destiny 2 was released in 2017. The update is entirely cosmetic, with no new quests, items, or events.</p><p>One likely explanation is that this is simply an oversight. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRw0xAFf77Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTuber Breshi</a> dug into the game's decoration files and concluded that this update was cut content from The Taken King's Dawning event back in 2016. Breshi theorized that this event was meant to go live on January 5, 2016, but when it was scrapped, Bungie scheduled it to go live on January 5, 2025 as a temporary fix and intended to go back later and remove it.</p><p>Despite seven years passing by since Bungie ceased official support, online servers for the first Destiny game are still functional and players are still logging in. It's likely that Bungie just forgot about this scrapped event, leaving it to suddenly update almost a decade later. Bungie hasn't responded and it's unclear whether they'll take any action such as reverting The Tower back to its original state.</p><p>Bungie is still hard at work on Destiny 2, as well as the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-gets-its-first-update-in-over-a-year-albeit-with-few-new-details/1100-6527427/" data-ref-id="1100-6527427">Marathon</a>, although it's unclear when the latter will be released. Bungie reportedly cancelled a spin-off game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-destiny-game-codenamed-payback-has-reportedly-been-cancelled/1100-6525485/" data-ref-id="1100-6525485">codenamed Payback</a>, and it seems like a Destiny 3 is not in the cards. A mobile game, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-risings-closed-alpha-test-starts-today-includes-multiplayer-and-story-content/1100-6527530/" data-ref-id="1100-6527530">Destiny Rising</a>, is currently in the works over at NetEase.</p>
