                <p>Supergiant Games has revealed some new details about Hades 2, including the fact that it runs at 60fps on Switch 2. The game is also launching later this year on the upcoming system as a timed console exclusive (also including the original Switch).</p><p>"We learned so much from developing the original [Hades] on Nintendo Switch and we wanted to take those learnings forward to Nintendo Switch 2," explained studio director Amir Rao in a new Nintendo Creator's Voice video. "That meant for us being completely uncompromising when it comes to performance. We really really want our games to perform at 60fps."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>He added that the extra power from Switch 2 will allow the studio to push Hades 2's graphical features. It got its second major update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-the-warsong-update-adds-ares-animal-familiar-new-songs-and-more/1100-6529593/" data-ref-id="1100-6529593">the Warsong update</a>, last month, which added in areas from the first game. The PC version has been in early access since last year. </p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hades-2-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6530552/" data-ref-id="1100-6530552">Hades 2 was announced for Switch 2</a> during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">April 2025 Direct</a>, although the studio didn't confirm any release date. It's currently in early access on Steam, so it's unclear when the full launch will happen. The game will come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles at a later date. </p><p>In GameSpot's early access <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/" data-ref-id="1900-6418231">Hades 2 review</a>, we said, "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market, even in its incomplete state."</p>
