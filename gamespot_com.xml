                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> may have only just launched but a well-known modder has already released a much requested Duos mode mod that players can download from the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenringnightreign/mods/3?tab=files&amp;file_id=14" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elden Ring Nightreign Nexus</a> for the PC version of the game.</p><p>The mod comes from Luke Yui, the modder also responsible for the popular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-mods/2900-5480/#2" data-ref-id="2900-5480">Seamless Co-op mod for Elden Ring</a>, as well as other From Software games. Within a few hours of Nightreign going live, Yui shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbKF9TOiMWI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short video</a> demonstrating a prototype two-player setup that wasn't connected to matchmaking servers. It wasn't long after that that the actual mod launched for everyone else to use.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Nightreign GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is intended as an online co-op game for three players, or solo, but with no option to only play in pairs unless they match with a random third wheel. While a three-person group is quite common in online games, including Apex Legends and Destiny, the lack of a duo option has not gone down well for folks who just want to play with a friend or partner. It's one of the criticisms highlighted amongst the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/#app_reviews_hash" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">negative reviews on Steam</a>, where the game is currently sitting at a "Mixed" rating. </p><p>The lack of a Duos Mode was made clear during Elden Ring Nightreign's announcement and game director Junya Ishizaki also explained in an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview back in December that the reason behind focusing on three players was "largely a game balancing decision, rather than a game design decision." In a later <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> interview ahead of the game's launch, Ishizaki did however admit that duos were "kind of overlooked and neglected" and hinted that support may come post-launch.</p><p>While nothing has been officially confirmed, this is yet another example of modders stepping in to add such missing features to a game.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is available now for PC, PS4, PS5, X.box One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>As the video game industry shifts from physical media to a digital future, game preservation is an increasingly relevant topic. Saving the history of the medium is important, and one gaming historian has just successfully preserved one of the rarest video games ever made.</p><p>Video game scholar Bruno de Figueiredo has announced (via <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/05/one-of-the-rarest-video-games-in-history-has-finally-been-preserved" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>) that he has posted the ISO online for TRIPITAKA, the sequel to Cosmology of Kyoto. The original title was released in 1993 in Japan by SoftEdge, and this non-linear adventure game was released in North America the following year where it gained a small following. The sequel is so obscure that only a single physical copy of TRIPITAKA is known to exist.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/dieubussy/status/1925575872720822422" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">After a long search, uncertain that it even existed, I finally located the CD-ROM TRIPITAKA 玄奘三蔵求法の旅, the elusive sequel to the legendary Cosmology of Kyoto. Here is the ISO for your emulational pleasure.<a href="https://t.co/vPtRjuo0BO" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/vPtRjuo0BO</a></p>  — Bruno de Figueiredo (@dieubussy) <a href="https://twitter.com/dieubussy/status/1925575872720822422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The physical CD-ROM for TRIPITAKA was sold via Yahoo Japan in 2023 for just under $300. After nearly two years, Figueiredo successfully convinced the owner to allow him to share the game online for posterity.</p><p>Last year, Xbox put together <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-put-together-a-new-team-focused-on-game-preservation/1100-6522463/" data-ref-id="1100-6522463">a team dedicated to game preservation</a>, while Sony set up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-has-set-up-a-new-game-preservation-department/1100-6502798/" data-ref-id="1100-6502798">its own game preservation team</a> two years prior. Nintendo has taken a more dim view of game preservation, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-game-key-cards-are-a-little-disheartening-for-game-preservation-says-dev/1100-6531262/" data-ref-id="1100-6531262">the upcoming Switch 2 game key cards</a> has caused some to question how the games attached to them will be saved for future generations. The U.S. Copyright Office also dealt the game preservation movement a blow when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-preservation-efforts-just-got-some-bad-news-from-us-copyright-office/1100-6527411/" data-ref-id="1100-6527411">refused to allow libraries to share their game collections online</a>.</p>

                <p>EA confirmed this week that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-its-developer-and-lays-off-additional-staff/1100-6531883/" data-ref-id="1100-6531883">canceled its upcoming Black Panther game and closed its developer, Cliffhanger Games</a>. A new report provides more context and background as to the situation surrounding the game's cancellation and what the game was aiming to be.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-05-30/why-ea-canceled-a-new-black-panther-video-game-and-closed-cliffhanger-studios?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0ODYyODA1OSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ5MjMyODU5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWDM2MEFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.5NJqkn46ldc6n5M7d2faM7HRVe-P6bpFT21kj1vHHl8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that the Black Panther game recently passed a development milestone, and the project was gaining momentum. However, sources said EA executives were upset that the game was still in pre-production after almost four years of work. After a portfolio review from EA management, the company reportedly chose to axe games in development for an extended period of time without making sufficient progress, and this included Black Panther.</p><p>Also canceled in this process were multiple titles at Apex Legends and Titanfall studio Respawn, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/" data-ref-id="1100-6531200">including a new Titanfall game</a>, according to previous reporting.</p><p>EA's Black Panther game was going to build on some of the ideas that Cliffhanger boss Kevin Stephens had worked on with the Shadow of Mordor series when he was at Warner Bros., including the Nemesis system, the report said. For the Black Panther game, T'Challa, Killmonger, and Shuri would be playable characters, vying to become the new Black Panther.</p><p>Players were going to fight against the Skrull shapeshifting aliens, who had come to Wakanda. Some of these characters in the game might be impostors, and would have remembered and learned from player behavior, similar to how orcs in Shadow of Mordor would remember players and act based on previous interactions.</p><p>Developers had a hard time showcasing what made the Black Panther game special in presentations with management, and processes were slowed due to the team building a game and a new studio at the same time, the report said.</p><p>Following the game's cancellation, staffers who worked on the project spoke out to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-panther-devs-mourn-eas-stunning-and-amazing-game/1100-6531912/" data-ref-id="1100-6531912">praise the work the team did on what they hoped would be an "amazing" game.</a> While the Black Panther game is no longer moving ahead, EA is still building an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/iron-man-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531545/" data-ref-id="1100-6531545">Iron Man game</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-black-panther-game-is-canceled-but-it-has-three-marvel-games-still-in-development/1100-6531945/" data-ref-id="1100-6531945">multiple Marvel projects as part of a multi-game deal with Marvel.</a></p><p>EA's Black Panther game is dead, but Amy Hennig's Marvel game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522227/" data-ref-id="1100-6522227">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, features Black Panther prominently. The game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed/1100-6531490/" data-ref-id="1100-6531490">delayed and is now coming in 2026. </a></p>

                <p>The Communications Workers of America, the union representing QA testers at ZeniMax, announced today that it has reached a tentative agreement on a labor contract with Microsoft. If implemented, this contract will be one of the first to go into effect at one of the big AAA game publishers.</p><p>Last month, the union <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">voted to authorize a strike</a> in response to challenges to the contract negotiation process; this agreement would avoid a strike from being carried out. In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/video-game-workers-reach-historic-tentative-contract-agreement-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>, CWA shared that the agreed contract would grant ZeniMax employees significantly increased protections and would raise pay across the board. It would also implement guidelines on the use of AI, restrict "arbitrary dismissal," and create processes to ensure that QA testers adequately receive credit in video games that they contribute to.</p><p>QA testing has been a hotspot of unionization efforts in the games industry, some of which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gaming-qa-workers-say-they-were-laid-off-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6524209/" data-ref-id="1100-6524209">have been targeted with union-busting efforts</a>. At ZeniMax, the QA testers' union represents around 300 employees and has been fighting for several years for this contract. In response to the agreement, Jessee Leese, a QA tester and union representative at ZeniMax, stated, "Video games have been the revenue titan of the entire entertainment industry for years, and the workers who develop these games are too often exploited for their passion and creativity. Organizing unions, bargaining for a contract, and speaking with one collective voice has allowed workers to take back the autonomy we all deserve."</p><p>In early 2023, ZeniMax employees created ZeniMax Workers United-CWA, a coalition of CWA units embedded in the company that was made possible under <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-formally-agrees-to-recognize-activision-blizzard-union/1100-6504549/" data-ref-id="1100-6504549">Microsoft's neutrality agreement with union activism.</a> Since then, unionization has expanded at Microsoft to include more teams; earlier in May, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-overwatch-team-has-unionized-were-not-just-a-number-on-an-excel-sheet/1100-6531438/" data-ref-id="1100-6531438">the Overwatch 2 team at Blizzard announced that it has fully unionized</a>. There are now over 2,000 unionized employees at Microsoft.</p><p>This contract still needs to complete several hurdles before it can be fully implemented. Now that both parties have tentatively agreed, the union will hold a series of explanation sessions for its members to learn about its provisions. Then, in late June, CWA expects to hold a ratification vote among its members.</p><p><i>Disclosure: The author of this article is a member of CWA by way of a graduate student union. </i></p>

Some theorized that Activision did this on purpose to help prevent people from quitting lobbies if they noticed they were going up against a group of high-level players. But it turns out this was only a bug.</p><p>Activision's <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1928497479617597649" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty Updates account</a> confirmed that the developer is investigating a bug that is causing player levels and level icons to fail to appear in lobbies. "Thank you for your reports! We are actively investigating this issue," Activision said on the game's <a href="https://trello.com/c/uAEvrBoF" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Trello board.</a></p><p>Some of the other known issues for Black Ops 6 multiplayer include theater mode being temporarily disabled due to an issue loading replays, lobbies showing the wrong platform icon next to a player's name, and the Winner's Circle failing to appear in some cases on Stakeout. Another known issue is that players who call in a Dreadnought may get stuck in a state where they're unable to crouch or slide.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-season-4-all-the-new-black-ops-6-multiplayer-maps-including-fan-favorite-remaster/2900-6609/" data-ref-id="2900-6609">new maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-new-call-of-duty-season-4-guns-and-how-to-unlock-them-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6617/" data-ref-id="2900-6617">guns</a> in the Season 4 update, along with our breakdown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-season-4-battle-pass-adds-stitch-and-two-new-guns-in-bo6-and-warzone/2900-6616/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6616">what's in the new battle pass.</a> The Zombies mode, meanwhile, gets a big update with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-grief-mode-explained/1100-6531917/" data-ref-id="1100-6531917">introduction of Grief mode.</a> There are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-open-the-overlook-safe-room-in-call-of-duty-warzone/1100-6531953/" data-ref-id="1100-6531953">numerous new updates for Warzone, too.</a></p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cods-infamous-riot-shield-returns-in-black-ops-6-but-not-how-you-think/1100-6531923/" data-ref-id="1100-6531923">Call of Duty's infamous riot shield has debuted in Black Ops 6 as a finishing move. </a> There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-wicks-ballerina-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/1100-6531722/" data-ref-id="1100-6531722">John Wick / Ballerina crossover store bundle coming soon.</a></p><p>If you're keen to try Black Ops 6's new Season 4 content, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-free-on-xbox-this-weekend-for-season-4-launch/2900-6626/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6626">multiplayer is free right now for Xbox users. </a></p>
