                <p>It's been an interesting month at Ubisoft, as the vice president executive producer of Assassin's Creed, Marc-Alexis CÃ´tÃ©, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left the company after nearly two decades</a>, and CÃ´tÃ© made it clear that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-says-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/1100-6535519/" data-ref-id="1100-6535519">it wasn't his choice to leave</a>. A subsequent rumor suggested that The Division's executive producer, Julian Gerighty, was also heading out the door. However, Ubisoft has officially denied that report while teasing a future for Gerighty that includes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/" data-ref-id="1100-6517899">The Division 3</a>.</p><p>In a message <a href="https://twitter.com/ubimassive/status/1979546362405351487?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on social media</a>, Ubisoft reaffirmed that Gerighty remains with the company while guiding The Division: Resurgence, The Division 2 and its upcoming expansion, Survivors, as well as The Division 3.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ubimassive/status/1979546362405351487?s=46" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Agents, weâ€™ve seen the rumors that Julian Gerighty has left Ubisoft - thatâ€™s far from true.<br>Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for The Division franchise, leading the creative vision for TCTD2, Resurgence, Survivors and TCTD3.

Now, a new report suggests that there are actually two Halo games coming in 2026 for the franchise's 25th anniversary, and one of those titles may be a live-service game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebs Gaming</a>, Halo Studios is working on "a live-service long-term updating [Halo] multiplayer game," before adding, "Its live-service component is like Fortnite." The report didn't offer any other specifics about the gameplay, but went on to add some comments about the way AI is used in the game's creation.</p><p>"Generative AI is apparently woven into every aspect of development, such as enemy AI and terrain generation. I think what they're mostly doing is that and then touching up the work with human hands. Also, developers are expected to meet similar or quicker deadlines and the only means to do so is through the use of AI, whether that's mundane tasks like scheduling things or writing emails all the way up to actual game development."</p><p>This part of the report went viral, which prompted Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden to respond.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/jezcorden/status/1979983889851396518?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Halo is not using generative AI in its game dev / art assets, etc. for its next game. <br>Microsoft has no mandate on studios to use generative AI for games. <br>I'm sure it's being used for emails n shit like that but they're not making a gen AI game here.</p>  â€” Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1979983889851396518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rebs Gaming later clarified his initial report.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1979666123747463470" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Many people are misinterpreting what I reported as if it directly confirms AI is being used in all the wrong ways and Halo is doomed.

The play test peaked at 189,668 concurrent players, and stayed in the top ten most played Steam games all weekend.</p><p>The weekend's open play test was designed as a stress test for the game's servers ahead of its official release on October 30, and it looks like the studio got what it was looking for. The test involved just one map, the Dam Battleground, and allowed players to try out the game's progression, crafting, and quest mechanics.</p>

                <p>If you're struggling to log in and play some of your favorite games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/">Fortnite</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/">Roblox</a>, you're not alone. A massive outage was reported with Amazon's AWS hosting service, impacting various services that make use of the company's cloud services.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c5y8k7k6v1rt" rel="nofollow ">BBC</a>, several of the affected video game services across the world include the PlayStation Network, Pokemon Go, Rocket League, and Wordle, alongside Fortnite and Roblox.</p><p><a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status" rel="nofollow ">In an update</a>, Amazon Web Services said it was starting to see "significant signs of recovery" and it was continuing to process a backlog of queued requests. "We have identified a potential root cause for error rates for the DynamoDB APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region," Amazon said. "We are working on multiple parallel paths to accelerate recovery."</p><p>Beyond gaming apps, the outage has also been felt across numerous banking services and programs across the globe. Earlier today, Ookla's platform outage monitor Downdetector said that more than four million reports had been logged--more than double of what it typically sees on a standard weekday morning.</p>
