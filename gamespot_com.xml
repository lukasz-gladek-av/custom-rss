                <p>Krafton has revealed a new name and more details for its first-ever PUBG spin-off. PUBG: Blindspot, which was previously known as Project Arc when it was revealed in 2024, is a top-down shooter launching in beta on Steam later this month.</p><p>Blindspot is a 5v5 tactical shooter that aims to offer a blend of strategy and shooting from a top-down perspective. The mission in the game is to break into a crypt inside a building to install an item called a Decrypter. Players use things like grenade launchers and explosive hammers to crush the building's walls to get into the crypt. Those on the defending team can set up barricades and other preventative measures to try to stop attackers from getting in.</p><p>"PUBG: Blindspot presents real-time line of sight shared with your teammates, which creates immediate, non-verbal cooperation, allowing you to experience fast-paced CQB combat with your teammates in real-time against actual players," Krafton said.</p><p>The game features weapons like the Mk14, AWM, and P90, as well as gadgets like proximity explosives, flashbangs, and smoke grenades, among other things. Take a look at the trailer below to get a closer look at Blindspot.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jP7p9DAKKI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A free demo for Blindspot launches February 20 at 8 PM PT / 11 PM ET on Steam--the game has only been confirmed for PC. The developer said it will gather feedback from fans to help "refine and enhance" the game. A release date has not been announced.</p><p>Blindspot is the first PUBG spin-off from the popular battle royale game. It wasn't always going to be the first spin-off, though, as the horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-is-no-longer-a-pubg-spin-off/1100-6503927/" data-ref-id="1100-6503927">The Callisto Protocol was going to be until plans changed.</a></p>

                <p>Just in time for Valentine's Day, Nintendo is dropping Wario Land 4 on Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack on February 14. The weird Game Boy Advance platformer sees the gassy antihero turning into Zombie Wario and Bouncy Wario--just a couple of the transformations--as he explores a golden pyramid for the riches inside.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wario-land-4-review/1900-2831796/">Wario Land 4</a> originally debuted in 2001 as an early title for Game Boy Advance. It's actually the fifth mainline Wario platformer in the series when taking into account Virtual Boy Wario Land. Additionally, Wario Land 4 arrived before the WarioWare franchise even existed.</p>

                <p>Artificial intelligence continues to be a major talking point in the world of video games and beyond, and now the top boss at GTA parent company Take-Two has chimed in with his thoughts. Strauss Zelnick said in an interview that artificial intelligence will be embraced as a digital tool to assist humans and that employment numbers will go up long-term as a result.</p><p>"Artificial intelligence is an oxymoron; there's no such thing. Machine learning... machines don't learn," he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-twos-strauss-zelnick-on-tariffs-ai-and-gta-6" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever."</p><p>He added: "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that history has shown time and again that the arrival of new digital technologies ultimately leads to further job creation, increased productivity, and increased GPD overall. "I think that's what's going to happen with AI. I think the video game business will probably be on the leading, if not bleeding, edge of using AI," he said.</p><p>Others in the video game space, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">Microsoft's Brad Smith</a>, have admitted that advancements to AI will lead to job losses in the short term while increasing employment rates on a longer-term timeline.</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said people are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">overstating the power and abilities of AI technologies</a>. "It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say that AI technologies may be similar to a hand calculator. Decades ago, parents worried that hand calculators would mean children wouldn't need to learn math, but that wasn't the case. "The answer is yes, you still have to learn math, turns out, you absolutely have to learn math, but you have a tool that makes it easier to do. And ChatGPT is the same thing," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Zelnick said Take-Two's efforts in the AI space will not infringe on other people's intellectual properties, as some have been accused of already. OpenAI, for example, is being <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sued by The New York Times</a> over claims that the AI company used its data to train its large language model. "So of course, we're mindful of what technology we use to make sure that it respects others' intellectual property and allows us to protect our own," he said.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>.</p><p>Video game voice actors remain on strike over concerns around AI, among other things. One of the more prominent voice actors, Jennifer Hale, has discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">why she believes AI is an "existential" threat.</a></p>

                <p>Rocksteady Studios, the esteemed UK-based developer known for its work on the Batman Arkham series, is said to be returning to Batman for its next project following the dismal performance of its last game, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Beyond that, WB Games Montreal is now believed to be formulating an idea for a new Game of Thrones title. This all came to light in a new report that shed light on future projects said to be in the works at WB's various game development teams.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> said, "Rocksteady is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game." However, the report said the game is "years away." There is no further information to go on at this stage.</p><p>Rocksteady Studios is best known for Batman: Arkham Asylum (2009), Batman: Arkham City (2011), and Batman: Arkham Knight (2015). 2024's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a big shift for the developer with its live-service approach and multiplayer elements. The game failed to find a big enough audience, leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">massive losses for parent company Warner Bros.</a> The game recently wrapped up its final wave of content, and many were upset over the game's real ending <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-finale-gives-everyone-a-happy-ending/1100-6528822/" data-ref-id="1100-6528822">revealing major characters who died were actually only clones. </a></p><p>The Bloomberg report also revealed that Batman: Arkham Origins studio WB Games Montreal was developing a live-service Batman game without Bruce Wayne. However, midway through development, plans changed, and the game that came out of it was the cooly received Gotham Knights in 2022.</p><p>After this, the report said WB Games Montreal tried to make a "1.5" version of Gotham Knights that aimed to address some of the shortcomings of the first game. However, sources told the site that higher-ups vetoed this idea and assigned staff to other internal game projects.</p><p>The report went on to say that the team at WB Games Montreal later pitched a Constantine game, and while management was said to be enthusiastic at one point, bosses ultimately suggested the team work on a game based on a more recognizable character. So it was decided to make a game based on The Flash, but that fell apart as well after 2023's Flash, starring Ezra Miller, was a dud at the box office.</p><p>WB Games Montreal is now said to be assisting Monolith Productions on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monoliths-wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">new Wonder Woman game that is reportedly encountering its own issues</a> and is developing a pitch for a new Game of Thrones title. There is no word on what the new Game of Thrones title might be, but given the wording that even a pitch isn't finished, it sounds like very, very early days.</p><p>WB Games focusing on core franchises like Batman and Game of Thrones is no big surprise, as parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/" data-ref-id="1100-6526460">seek to maximize the chances of success by centering its attention on only the biggest franchises</a>. Beyond Batman and Game of Thrones, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/making-a-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-is-one-of-warner-bros-biggest-priorities/1100-6526285/" data-ref-id="1100-6526285">a sequel to Hogwarts Legacy is in development at Avalanche Software.</a></p><p>This report came out no long after WB Games boss David Haddad departed the company. A replacement has not yet been named.</p><p>Warner Bros. gaming boss JB Perrette admitted to Bloomberg that WB Games is running into some tough times of late, but he believes the company will turn things around in time. "We won't get back to the profitability we want to get back to in the next two to three years. It will take two to three years to rebuild, [and] reset to levels we want to be at, but the bounce back is immediate as far as going from loss-making to profitability," he said.</p>
