                <p>Microsoft has announced a price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raising the price by 50% from $20 to $30 per month</a>. You do not have to pay that much everywhere, however. GameStop, for example, has <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will not raise the price of Game Pass Ultimate for in-store and online shoppers, at least not yet.</p><p>The retailer continues to sell one-month Game Pass Ultimate memberships for $20 or three-month memberships for $60. This appears to be a promotion, so it's not likely to last forever, meaning you may want to snap it up now before it's too late. The price comes down to $19 for one month or $57 for a three-month subscription if you're a GameStop Pro member ($25/year).</p><p>Beyond GameStop, mega-retailer Amazon is also continuing to sell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Ultimate for $20/month</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 for three months</a>, as are <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fmio2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fjxgyc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.<a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><br></a></p><p>A variety of other online retailers are selling Game Pass Ultimate for $20 or less right now for a one-month membership, so be sure to shop around before signing up for the new, higher rate.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement of yet another price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was met with a negative response online. The price hike for Game Pass followed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price increase of consoles, too.</a></p><p>Price increases were always expected, though, as subscription services are known to debut at a low price to drive adoption and then go up in price as the company behind them looks to monetize the base of subscribers. Still, the 50% price hike was more than many expected for Game Pass Ultimate, even with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">newly added perks like Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. </a></p><p>PC Game Pass is also going up in price, from $12/month to $16.50/month. Just like with Ultimate, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0DX8GZ5VT?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Game Pass prepaid codes</a> are still available for the lower price at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0CMZMYLKJ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Core</a> and Game Pass Standard are changing names to Game Pass Essential ($10/month) and Game Pass Premium ($15/month), and there are no price hikes for those tiers.</p><p>Looking ahead, one industry analyst believes Microsoft could offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">lower-priced ad-based Game Pass tier</a> to help draw in more subscribers. Game Pass brings in lots of money already for Microsoft, as the company recently disclosed it reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. </a></p>

You should not pay $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate right now, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">many retailers have not raised prices.</a></p><p>For PC Game Pass, the price is going up from $12/month to $16.50/month, and one of the new perks is access to around 50 more Ubisoft games. PC Game Pass will also continue to get Microsoft's new releases on day one just like Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>The Game Pass price hikes came just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Microsoft raised prices on Xbox consoles in the US yet again. </a></p>

                <p>When it comes to building a winning team in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26/" data-ref-id="5000-686587">EA Sports FC 26</a>, the right formation is just as important as the players you pick. A good formation can unlock your teamâ€™s true potential, while the wrong one can leave you exposed at every turn. But whether youâ€™re someone who favors the gegenpress over tiki-taka, thereâ€™s a formation for you.</p><p>This guide will explain the <strong>best FC 26 formations</strong>, breaking down their strengths and weaknesses, while explaining what type of players youâ€™ll need to make it work. From tried and tested setups like 4-2-3-1 Wide to more experimental systems like 3-5-2, weâ€™ll help you find the perfect shape to dominate in your next Division Rivals or Career Mode game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577773"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577773-best-fc-26-formation-41212-narrow.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_1_2_1_2_Narrow">4-1-2-1-2 Narrow</h2><p dir="ltr">The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow meta is back, and we couldnâ€™t be more delighted. This diamond formation wasnâ€™t really favoured in the FC 25 meta, but itâ€™s having a bit of a resurgence.</p><p dir="ltr">Itâ€™s designed for players who want to dominate possession in the middle of the pitch, using quick passing and deep runs to open up their opponentâ€™s defensive line. Your CDM acts as an anchor to help control the play with two box-to-box central midfielders, while a creative CAM acts as a Shadow Striker.</p><p dir="ltr">Two strikers up front are able to play off one another or hold up the ball for midfield reinforcements. As the name suggests, the formation is tight, so if the ball is overturned, the CDM should be sitting in the passing lanes waiting for the right ball to intercept.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation really only works if you have good fullbacks and a talented CDM for cover. Since the shape is quite predictable, it can be easy for an attacking squad to carve the backline open because of the space left behind.</p><p dir="ltr">Hereâ€™s how we set up our squad:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: AxZKwE4#K8S</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Counter</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Sweeper Keeper, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Box-to-Box, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Poacher, Attack / Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577771"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577771-best-fc-26-formation-4231-wide.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_2_3_1_Wide">4-2-3-1 Wide</h2><p dir="ltr">If you used 4-2-3-1 last year, this will feel rather familiar. With four defenders, two CDMs, and one CAM, this is arguably one of the most balanced formations you can use.</p><p dir="ltr">This formation offers you control in transitional play, while giving you lots of attacking options up front. The CAM - acting as a Shadow Striker -is the creative link between the lone striker and the wingers, who should cut inside to receive passes. In defense, two CDMs support the four-strong defensive line, helping to cover the passing lanes to break up play.</p><p dir="ltr">Weâ€™ve set this up so that the CDMs are involved in build up play, but weâ€™d recommend having a striker who can adequately fulfil an Advanced Forward role. Weâ€™ve also locked our fullbacks into a defensive set up, but if you want to stretch the play more, you can switch them to a balanced view.</p><p dir="ltr">Hereâ€™s how weâ€™ve set it up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: GZewNW4MwiDo</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Ball-Playing Keeper, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender/Ball-Playing Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (L): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">CDM (R): Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CAM: Shadow Striker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577772"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577772-best-fc-26-formation-442-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="4_4_2_Holding">4-4-2 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This is one of the most popular formations in the game - and one thatâ€™s perfect if youâ€™re just starting out. This is because your defense, midfield, and attackers are all perfectly balanced on the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">With four players in defense and midfield, it offers a strong defensive structure while offering you options in attack with two strikers. The wide midfielders and fullbacks can stretch the attack on the counter to create chances.</p><p dir="ltr">This balanced spread makes it difficult for opponents to find gaps to attack. However, with only two central players in midfield, you can find yourself overrun when coming up against teams that overload the middle of the pitch.</p><p dir="ltr">To help counter this, weâ€™ve opted to use the Holding version of the formation to reinforce the defense in light of FC 26â€™s reduced AI defending gameplay. This gives us two CDMs, rather than two central midfielders.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are our tactics in full:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: SBs8ciEacQ%U</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB / RB: Fullback, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build Up</li><li dir="ltr">LM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: Advanced Forward, Attack</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4577777"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18643060/4577777-best-fc-26-formation-433-holding.jpeg"></figure><h2 id="4_3_3_Holding">4-3-3 Holding</h2><p dir="ltr">This formation is one of the most versatile attacking formations in the game, giving you plenty of width, decent midfield control, and clear attacking options. With three forwards you can stretch pretty much any defense with quick passing through both wide options and central midfield.</p><p dir="ltr">4-3-3 formations work really well for players who like to counter quickly and directly using plenty of width. If you want to slow it down, your midfield options can dictate the tempo with the fullbacks dropping in to create more space. The only problem is that this shape can be overrun by the formations above. If your midfielders are caught out of possession high up the pitch, you may struggle to win the ball back.</p><p dir="ltr">To counter this, weâ€™ve set up our squad so we have a holding CDM, flanked by a deep-lying playmaker and a playmaker in central midfield. Our wingers will provide width in attack, with one wingback available on support duties.</p><p dir="ltr">If youâ€™re going to opt for this formation, youâ€™re going to need strong, fast wingers who have decent shooting and passing stats. Youâ€™re also going to need a talented striker who can finish consistently from anywhere in the box.</p><p dir="ltr">Hereâ€™s how weâ€™d set this up:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Code: EBdk%umK%GAm</li><li dir="ltr">Build up Style: Short Passing</li><li dir="ltr">Defensive Approach: High</li><li dir="ltr">Goalkeeper: Goalkeeper, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">LB: Fullback, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">RB: Wingback, Support</li><li dir="ltr">CB: Defender, Defend</li><li dir="ltr">CDM: Holding, Ball-Winning</li><li dir="ltr">CM: Deep-Lying Playmaker, Build-Up / Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">LW: Inside Forward, Balanced</li><li dir="ltr">RM: Wide Playmaker, Attack</li><li dir="ltr">ST: False 9, Attack</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Why_are_these_the_best_FC_26_formations_">Why are these the best FC 26 formations?</h2><p dir="ltr">With 29 different formations available in the game, you might be wondering why weâ€™ve selected just four above. The simple answer is that they best fit the current meta, where compact shapes and quick passing dominate. The AI defending changes this year mean you have to rely on tight shape, passing lanes, and quick transitions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the formations weâ€™ve highlighted offer a strong defensive base, clear attacking patterns, and an adaptability that will help you gain the upper hand in competitive matches. The 4-1-2-1-2 Narrow gives you central overloads and passing triangles, 4-2-3-1 Wide balances structure with creativity, 4-4-2 Holding gives you a balanced foundation to build from, and 4-3-3 stretches defense with pace and width.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the best FC 26 formations will change with future updates, but for now these are the tactics weâ€™d use to gain the upper hand in Division Rivals, Ultimate Team, and Career Mode.</p>
