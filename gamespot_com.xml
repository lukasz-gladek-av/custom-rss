<p dir="ltr">As for Colossal Order, the studio will deliver a few more updates before Iceflake fully takes over. Those will include a major update that will add bikes, Old Town buildings, and other improvements. A beta version of the game's editor with mod-asset support will also arrive before the end of the year. Iceflake will then take over the franchise at the start of 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">In the forum post, Colossal Order Mariina Hallikainen said the studio never could have imagined Cities: Skylines would become a franchise played by millions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're confident the franchise will continue to thrive under Paradox's leadership," Hallikainen said. "As we move forward, we're excited to channel our experience, creativity, and passion into new projects that align with our long-term vision."</p><p dir="ltr">Iceflake will be sharing its own plans for Cities: Skylines 2 development in the coming weeks, and is working with Colossal Order to ensure a smooth transition, according to the forum post. Iceflake Studio manager Lasse Liljedahl said taking over the franchise is "an immense honor and a great responsibility," while noting the developer has a long history of making city-building games, like 2021's post-apocalyptic city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/684450/Surviving_the_Aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Surviving the Aftermath</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"We see a strong foundation and so much potential waiting to be unleashed and I can't wait to show you what we have planned for the next chapter of this incredible game," Liljedahl said.</p><p dir="ltr">The forum post doesn't state a specific reason for why Colossal Order and Paradox are going their separate ways, but the launch of Cities: Skylines 2 wasn't exactly smooth. Prior to launch in October 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paradox-interactive-warns-of-cities-skyline-2-performance-issues-ahead-of-launch/1100-6518493/" data-ref-id="1100-6518493">Paradox warned players about the game's performance issues</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">After release, Colossal Order <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-developers-provide-update-on-performance-issues-and-post-release-plans/1100-6518701/" data-ref-id="1100-6518701">acknowledged various performance problems</a> and stated its goal was to continue optimizing the title so that it could run at a stable 30 frames per second. In response to the game's rough launch, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cities-skylines-2-dev-acknowledges-games-rough-state-and-rushed-dlc-making-big-changes/1100-6522761/" data-ref-id="1100-6522761">Beach Properties DLC was made free</a>, with additional content added to the game's Ultimate Edition. Cities: Skylines 2 currently sports a "Mixed" user review rating on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/949230/Cities_Skylines_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, while the original <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cities: Skylines</a> has "Very Positive" reviews.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Sonic Colors celebrated its 15-year anniversary on November 16, 2025. Below, we look back at how the game shifted the nature of Sonic games with new gimmicks.</em></p><p>Sonic Colors marked a significant turning point in Sonic the Hedgehog's gaming career. Four years prior, the franchise had hit a horrifying low with Sonic the Hedgehog 2006. Two years after that, Sonic began a slow and shaky climb from rock bottom with 2008's Sonic Unleashed. And in 2010, Sonic Colors finally brought the blue hedgehog back into gamers' good graces, becoming the best-received 3D title since the Adventure games of the late '90s and early 2000s. Things were finally starting to look bright again for the franchise--but with the good came the bad as well.</p><p>Up to that point, 3D Sonic games had learned more heavily into their narratives, with the Sonic Adventure duology and Sonic the Hedgehog 2006 standing out as significant examples. For Colors, the plot was scaled back considerably, harkening back to the simpler stories of Sonic's classic games. In fact, like most of the classics, Colors foregoes an opening cinematic completely. Once the player moves beyond the title screen, they're immediately dropped into the first level. Only then does the story begin to take shape: Sonic and Tails have made a trip to space to investigate Eggman's Interstellar Amusement Park, a creation of the mad doctor designed as penance for his evil misdeeds in the past.</p><p>Naturally, the duo isn't buying Eggman's change of heart for a second. Their suspicions are confirmed as they almost immediately discover that the park is a front for a sinister alien-enslavement operation, in which Eggman plans to use their energy to power a giant mind-control device and--you guessed it--conquer the world. Now, it's up to Sonic to race across the six captive planets that make up Eggman's twisted amusement park and free their inhabitants from his grasp. It's a plot ripped straight out of a goofy Saturday-morning cartoon, and a refreshing change after years of the franchise's hit-and-miss attempts at deeper and more complex stories.</p><div

To facilitate this, Sega brought on US-based writers Ken Pontac and Warren Graff of Happy Tree Friends fame to write the game's dialogue. The characters' personalities remained intact, albeit with a much snarkier edge than they typically displayed. This is perhaps best exemplified in Eggman's PA announcements. In every level, messages from Eggman play at regular intervals over the park's PA system. These range from warnings not to lick the rides at Sweet Mountain to the importance of holding your breath while in Asteroid Coaster's harsh vacuum of space.</p><p>What made these lines work comedically was their brevity. Actual conversations between characters, however, were a different story. Many jokes and gags were laboriously drawn out to the point that they stopped being funny. Sonic is no stranger to cracking off amusing one-liners, but much of the dialogue in Colors is akin to a frat boy at a party telling a joke that doesn't land, then trying to explain to his unamused audience why they should be laughing. If you've ever heard the insipid phrase "Baldy McNosehair" in gaming circles and were unsure where it originated, well … here you go. Pontac and Graff (who, as a side note, had virtually no prior knowledge of the Sonic franchise when writing for Colors) would continue to write for subsequent titles up through 2017's Sonic Forces, contributing to a strong tonal shift for the series that would define that decade of Sonic games.</p><p>For the first time in a 3D Sonic game, the focus was put solely on traditional high-speed Sonic gameplay--a move greatly appreciated by fans weary of the series' insistence on alternate gameplay styles. The boost mechanic returned after its successful debut in Sonic Unleashed, allowing Sonic to attain blisteringly high speeds with a simple push of a button. Of course, with the original Sonic Colors being exclusive to Nintendo Wii, a console with far lower processing power than its contemporaries, it wasn't nearly as flashy or exhilarating as its predecessor was on PS3 or Xbox 360, but it was serviceable enough. Colors also brought back Unleashed's occasional switch from 3D to 2D gameplay and allowed platforming to take center stage. Unfortunately, much of said platforming was clunky and methodical, lacking the flow and speed that made older side-scrolling Sonic games unique and fun.</p><p>What <em>was</em> unique and fun was the introduction of the aforementioned wisps: small alien creatures made of pure energy that augmented Sonic's speed-based abilities. After absorbing their powers, Sonic could transform into a cyan laser that zips along pathways, an orange rocket that shoots upward destroying everything in its path, a yellow drill that tears through the ground, or even a blue cube that … well, turns things into cubes to hop onto (not all of them were winners). Most of these powers felt like natural extensions of Sonic's typical gameplay as opposed to the drastically different alternate gameplay styles of past games.</p><p>At the time, fans and critics alike lauded Sonic Colors, and in some respects, deservedly so. It was a refreshing, back-to-basics approach that Sonic desperately needed after years of bizarre experimentation with team-based gameplay, guns, out-of-place human romances, werehogs, and the like. On the other hand, it was also a significant dilution of the Sonic formula that would unfortunately become a defining characteristic of the franchise throughout the 2010s. It was both a return to form and a troubling portent of things to come. Thankfully, recent games like Sonic Frontiers have sent the pendulum swinging back in the other direction, bringing onboard longtime Sonic scribe Ian Flynn and once again fleshing out the gameplay and story elements. We're currently in a promising new era for Sonic, but there's no telling if we would have gotten here without the huge shakeup--for better or worse--that Sonic Colors brought to the franchise 15 years ago.</p>
