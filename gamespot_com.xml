Developer Ballistic Moon added a reworked prologue and adjusted the story's pacing so that several characters were given more screen time, threw in new collectibles to discover, and added several accessibility settings. Visually, the game also has updated character models, environments, visual effects, and animations alongside new interactive props and artistic changes that heighten the spooky atmosphere.</p>                      </div><p>Until Dawn's live-action movie adaptation released in April and finished its theatrical run with over $53 million worldwide. Not exactly a smash hit, but it brought in more than three times its $15 million budget. It's a fun horror movie and a solid take on the source material with some clever new ideas mixed in. Until Dawn's 4K Blu-ray edition released earlier this month for $50. Along with the 4K UHD disc, you'll get a standard Blu-ray disc, a code to redeem the digital edition, and a number of bonus materials that explore how this gruesome film was produced.</p><p>Here's the full list of Until Dawn special features:</p><ul><li>Adapting a Nightmare - Director David F.

                <p>News about the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> doesn't sound like it will be coming soon, as Blizzard has said it will next update the community on what's next for its ARPG around the launch of Season 10.</p><p dir="ltr">In a reply to a fan on X asking for Diablo 4 updates, Diablo's director of social and content marketing Adam Fletcher <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the following.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 Launch.</p>  — Adam Fletcher (@PezRadar) <a href="https://twitter.com/PezRadar/status/1948505796410835265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We are in between seasons so nothing to share yet. Next update around PTR for S10/S10 launch," Fletcher said.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Diablo 4 Season 9's in-game timer, Season 10 is likely to start September 23. Typically, public test realm tests for a season are done several weeks prior, which would put the PTR around early September or perhaps late August. That means the game's next Campfire Chat, where Blizzard regularly outlines its future Diablo 4 plans, will be around that same time.</p><p dir="ltr">What that translates to is that, for about a month, there will likely be no news about what's next for Diablo 4. It's a bit confusing for fans, as a handful of Diablo 4 content creators recently revealed they attended a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-content-creators-just-got-a-secret-glimpse-of-the-games-future/1100-6533139/" data-ref-id="1100-6533139">Blizzard meeting on Diablo 4's future</a>. During the meeting they were shown what sounds like some of the significant changes fans have been asking to be currently in the works for Diablo 4.</p><p dir="ltr">News of the content creator meeting led many to believe some major announcements about how Blizzard will improve Diablo 4 to be imminent. Fletcher himself said in June that players' "warcries of wanting more change aren't going unnoticed," and stated that the team "has been cooking on some of the biggest changes that really hit home on things people have been asking for and more."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">Diablo 4 2025 roadmap</a> states that Season 10, Infernal Chaos, will be the last season for 2025, and will bring changes to the game's Infernal Hordes activity, new seasonal powers, and a new IP crossover. In 2026, the roadmap <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">teases a new expansion</a>, ranking system, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">It's possible Blizzard could still make a new Diablo 4 expansion announcement at Gamescom in August, but it seems like players may have to wait longer than they'd like in order to learn what steps Blizzard is taking to improve the ARPG in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, Diablo 4 Season 9, which recently just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-9-patch-notes-reveal-increased-rewards-and-big-barbarian-buffs/1100-6533122/" data-ref-id="1100-6533122">majorly buffed Barbarians</a>, is ongoing. Blizzard is also preparing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">release Diablo 4 in China</a> after receiving government approval.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2><strong>When is the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>There is no release date yet for the Battlefield 6 open beta, but online speculation suggests it will begin in early August.</p><h2><strong>How to get into the Battlefield 6 open beta</strong></h2><p>Given it's an open beta, presumably anyone will be able to access the Battlefield 6 test. If it works like other open betas, players will be able to find the download from their store of choice and go from there.</p><h2><strong>What's in the Battlefield 6 open beta?</strong></h2><p>The contents of the Battlefield 6 open beta have not been announced, but it's expected the beta will allow players to try out some of the maps and modes. Battlefield Studios also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-confirmed-will-include-this-key-change/1100-6533303/" data-ref-id="1100-6533303">already confirmed</a> that the beta will allow players to choose either an "open" or "closed" weapon setup.</p><p>"Why not both?" the developer said. In the open beta, players can choose playlists that have signature weapons locked to a specific class, or not. "More to come," the developer said.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom. It appears DICE is trying to appease both audiences by giving them the option in Battlefield 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239" data-ratio="0.55546875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540239"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 6's open beta is on the way.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4540239-bf6.jpg"></figure><p>Battlefield 6 has a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">campaign mode</a>, too, along with the rumored return of the Portal mode and a potential battle royale mode. The open beta, however, is only expected to offer up a multiplayer trial.</p><h2><strong>Does progress from the beta carry forward?</strong></h2><p>EA has not officially announced the specifics of the Battlefield 6 open beta, but history suggests that progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. This is how things normally work, and it's expected that will continue with Battlefield 6's open beta.</p><p>Battlefield 6 is the first new Battlefield game since 2021's tepidly received Battlefield 2042. A release date hasn't been announced, but speculation suggests it's launching on October 10. That's about a month before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s rumored November 14 release date.</p>

                <p>Despite the ongoing problems and constant shuttering of live service games, it's looking like Warner Bros still wants a piece of that questionable pie. A job listing at Warner Bros Games Montreal for an <a href="https://wbgamesmontreal.com/en/jobs/r000096070/" rel="nofollow ">executive producer role</a> went live recently (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/following-suicide-squads-flop-warner-bros-is-hiring-for-another-live-service-game/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), which explicitly makes mention of live service titles. The role would "oversee post-launch content and live service strategy," for one, and it also notes that having a "deep understanding of the full game development lifecycle, including live services," would be beneficial experience.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a couple of mentions of overseeing live operation processes, so it certainly seems like whatever WB Games Montreal is working on will have some kind of live service element. That obviously might raise some eyebrows for a couple of reasons.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The bigger of the two is of course what happened with last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" data-ref-id="5000-517540">Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League</a>, which was a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/">massive financial flop for Warner Bros</a>, reportedly leading to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-developer-let-go-of-more-employees-at-the-end-of-2024-report/1100-6528674/">layoffs at developer Rocksteady</a>.

                <p>Get ready to draw, doodle, animate, and compose as Mario Paint has returned for the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 via the Nintendo Classics Online library. Originally released in 1992 for the Super NES, Mario Paint turned your console into a full-on art studio, complete with a mouse and a whole world of creative tools. Now, a new generation can jump in and create colorful masterpieces, goofy animations, and original tunes--all with a modern twist.</p><p>On Nintendo Switch 2, you can use the Joy-Con 2’s new mouse-style controls to sketch, paint, and animate. Prefer a traditional setup? Plug in a compatible USB mouse--sold separately--on either Switch model and go old-school. And yes, the iconic music maker is back too, so get ready to compose your next virtual jam with chirping cats and bobbing mushrooms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok8hd9D6ImM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ok8hd9D6ImM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Coloring Book is back with fresh designs and your favorite Nintendo characters to fill in, freestyle, or remix however you want. If you're feeling competitive, Gnat Attack is back to perfect your mouse skills.</p><p>If you're a Nintendo Switch Online member, you can save your creations and share them online. On Switch 2, GameChat2 lets you connect with voice, video, or screen share, so you can sketch, animate, or just hang out and watch your friends draw a very questionable Yoshi. Let the creative chaos begin.</p>
