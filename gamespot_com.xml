                <p dir="ltr">If you don't play games on PC (or even if you do), you might not know that there's been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=parkour" rel="nofollow ">a run on parkour games</a> for a while now. All of these also compete with games like Roblox and Fortnite, where parkour sims carve out a major aspect of the user-generated worlds on display. But one of these parkour games stands out above the rest: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rooftops-and-alleys/" data-ref-id="5000-612233">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's both the highest-rated parkour game on Steam (among those with more than just a handful of reviews) and has the most Steam reviews by far, with 96% of its nearly 5,000 user reviews giving the game the illustrious "Overwhelmingly Positive" distinction on the digital storefront. Soon, it'll be leaving early access and coming to consoles as well, with a 1.0 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S scheduled for June 17.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGtD2Kz2tH8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nGtD2Kz2tH8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During my hands-on time with the game, it was quickly apparent how much solo developer Michel Losch drew inspiration from the past. The arena-like maps and the ability to freely go wherever and chain together stylish moves felt like something right out of a classic Tony Hawk game. One of its maps, The Shed, seems to intentionally invoke imagery of Tony Hawk's beloved warehouse level. Still, I agreed with Losch's assessment that the physics and required stick skills of his game end up landing Rooftops &amp; Alleys (R&amp;A) somewhere in the middle of Tony Hawk and the more sim-like Skate series from EA.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, none of R&amp;A is performed on boards either, so it also gave me Mirror's Edge vibes (albeit, in third-person, not first-person), and Losch name-dropped Jet Set Radio Future as another inspiration. Like DICE's classic dystopian freerunning game, high-level play in R&amp;A looks so effortlessly cool, and even a beginner like me can appear skilled and stylish--provided they don't skip the tutorial. And much like Jet Set Radio Future, that sense of style in R&amp;A's gameplay extends beyond movement to influence the audiovisual experience--playable characters offer lots of colorful customization, and there's an eclectic soundtrack that Losch and his fiancée produced together.</p><p dir="ltr">I was both impressed and, at times, intimidated by the game's mechanics. Any one move itself was easy to perform, but the real magic of parkour is chaining together a long sequence of maneuvers, which wasn't as easy to pull off. Not that I'm complaining--the upward skill slope was an enjoyable climb, culminating in an incredible sense of flow when it all briefly came together (I tended to see my character come crashing down eventually).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482109"></a><figcaption>The Shed map reminded me a lot of Tony Hawk's famous warehouse level.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482109-ss_28e0e3a1e1192f3f1a1faf7a1a8ef9d03dda0fbc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the true test, though, I handed the controller off to my 12-year-old son, who would probably prefer I describe him as a (virtual) parkour expert. He loved what he played and felt like, while it was more challenging than something like Parkour Reborn on Roblox--which is more like a Spider-Man sim anyway, if you ask me--he appreciated the intricacies of the controls, and how the things you could do in the game very much resemble the reality of parkour. Rooftops &amp; Alleys doesn't seem like it will stray too far from that reality, for now anyway, and instead equips players with the tools to perform feats that parkour athletes can accomplish in the real world. Maybe some future update will send players to the moon, but, for now, it's all intentionally grounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Since debuting in Steam Early Access, the game has received 30 updates, Losch told me, including two additional maps, lots of challenges, several multiplayer modes (such as Tag and Capture The Flag), and numerous enhancements to the game's foundational movement mechanics. But the game's next milestone is maybe its most important.</p><p dir="ltr">"1.0 will be the biggest update yet," Losch said. "The game will get its sixth map, a brand-new online multiplayer game mode (Tricks Battle), a lot of new time trials and trick rush challenges, new music, over 100 different customization options, a full progression system with unlockables, fun achievements, improved gameplay mechanics--such as the brand new physical sliding mechanic, which is purely momentum-based--and an amazing photo mode which I honestly could not be more proud of!"</p><p dir="ltr">To date, R&amp;A has sold more than 150,000 copies, which isn't half bad when you consider Losch set out to pursue game dev as a passion project on the side of his 15-year career as a music producer and DJ. "[2023] marked the beginning of my solo game dev journey, so I had to learn Unreal Engine from scratch and overcome many hurdles that previously kept me from going for it and making my dream parkour game," he told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4482110"></a><figcaption>Rooftops and Alleys is not a game where you can hold a button to auto-parkour in style. Each step is earned.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4482110-ss_3afbd42240a8ce19da0ed36c717cb75b7f81b404.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Fair to say, now I am happy to have done it, and love seeing people like it as much as I do." He continued, "I have been craving a good parkour game my entire life [...] I think I honestly got lucky in the sense that my personal taste and itch for a certain pParkour game seemed to have been aligned overall with the [genre's] community and players."</p><p dir="ltr">Rooftops &amp; Alleys: The Parkour Game gets its Steam 1.0 update and debuts on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on June 17.</p>

Nearly five years into the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S's lifespan, EA has finally decided to drop the PS4 and Xbox One versions. 2013's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/madden-nfl-25-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-169790">Madden NFL 25</a> was the first game in the series to release on PS4 and Xbox One, and every annual release in the series has been available on those platforms until this year.</p><p>Additionally, Madden NFL 26 will be the first game in the series to be released on Nintendo Switch 2.

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 has seen tremendous growth since launching in 2020. Originally littered with bugs, Night City is now better than it’s ever been--thanks to dozens of updates from CDPR and the brilliant Phantom Liberty expansion that transformed the world and strengthened the narrative. Nintendo users weren't able to play the open-world RPG on Switch, but they will be able to play it on Switch 2 on June 5, which is the same day the console launches. <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Cyberpunk+2077+Nintendo+Switch+2+Preorders+Are+Live+-+Full+Game+Is+On+The+Cart&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-04-24+09%3A11%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531086&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2%2F16204669929%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-nintendo-switch-physical-game-cartridge-preorder-walmart%2F1100-6531086%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition</a> is now available to preorder for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p><div title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3427" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch 2" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/goto.walmart.com\/c\/1804712\/565706\/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2\/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1804712/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Cyberpunk-2077-Ultimate-Edition-Nintendo-Switch-2/16204669929&amp;subId1=subid_value">$70 | Releases June 5</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the only version of the game up for preorder.

                <p>EA Sports has announced a new paid season pass for FC 25, the first of its kind for the soccer series, and the developer anticipated fans having a lot of questions about this.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, EA Sports said the paid season pass is "purely additive," but many believe it's just the latest example of EA trying to squeeze even more money out of players beyond the microtransaction-heavy Ultimate Team mode. The FC 25 "Premium Pass," as it's called, can be purchased with FC Points or UT Coins at a cost of 1,000 FC Points ($10 USD) or 500,000 worth of in-game earnable UT Coins.</p><p><span>As for what's included, players get tradeable packs and Season Points boosters, along with more player items, evolution consumables, retro-themed cosmetics. The graphic below shows everything included with the paid expansion pack, and some of the content is exclusive to the Premium Pass.</span></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027" data-ratio="0.56" data-width="1025" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4482027"></a><figcaption>The new Premium Pass includes all of this content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4482027-screenshot2025-04-24at11.00.04am.png"></figure><h2><strong>What's In The Premium Season Pass</strong></h2><p><em>Descriptions written by EA</em></p><ul><li>Tradeable Packs  <ul><li>For the first time, we’re including Tradeable Packs as part of Seasonal Rewards through the Premium Pass.</li></ul></li><li>SP (Season Points) Boosters  <ul><li>Receive 10,000 SP at level 20 of the Premium Pass, unlocking up to 10 levels of the Premium and Standard Pass Seasonal ladder.</li></ul></li><li>Player Items  <ul><li>TOTS Flashbacks.</li><li>TOTS Honourable Mentions (based on 2024/25 performances).</li></ul></li><li>Evolution Consumables  <ul><li>Earn Evolution Consumables that provide Role++ and Playstyle+ improvements  <ul><li>In the Standard Ladder, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 94 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li><li>In the Premium Pass, the requirements for the Playstyle+ Evolutions will be: Max 95 OVR, Max 8 Playstyles, Max 3 Playstyle+.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Retro Cosmetic Evolutions  <ul><li>Similar to the Cosmetic Evolutions introduced during FUT Birthday, we’ll be introducing more retro shell designs from Football Ultimate Team history and this time they’ll be TOTS themed.</li></ul></li></ul><p>FC 25 already has a Standard Pass, and the rewards for that track will continue "as if there was no Premium Pass," EA said. The company said the paid pass is "purely additive," going on to note that EA will not move rewards from the Standard Pass to the Premium Pass.</p><p>EA went on to mention how it plans to monitor fan feedback about the new Premium Pass "to. make sure we deliver the best experience possible," encouraging fans to submit their feedback in the <a href="https://discord.gg/easportsfc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Sports FC Discord</a> or through the <a href="https://signin.ea.com/p/juno/login?execution=e301423801s1&amp;initref=https%3A%2F%2Faccounts.ea.com%3A443%2Fconnect%2Foauth%3Fdisplay%3DjunoWeb%252Flogin%26response_type%3Dcode%26redirect_uri%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurvey.alchemer.com%252Fs3%252F8028603%252FPlayer-Feedback-Portal-Beta%26client_id%3DALCHEMER_WEB_APP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Player Feedback Portal.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA Sports FC subreddit</a> is already filled with people talking about the Premium Pass, with many comments <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EASportsFC/comments/1k5f2pe/anyone_defending_a_paid_season_pass_for_this_game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">expressing frustration</a> over its introduction.</p><p>EA's games in general, and its sports titles specifically, are known to be filled with microtransactions--these prove to be lucrative for the company. For EA's latest quarter, the company made <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Press-Release-FINAL.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$1.3 billion from "live services,"</a> compared to $600 million for full-game sales.</p>

                <p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders for the Switch 2</a> in the US hit late last night, and it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">as chaotic as you'd expect</a>. Retailers suffered from technical issues and available supply sold out quickly, with some customers even finding their orders canceled. Over on eBay, the predictable wave of US Switch 2 preorder resales has now begun, but some listings aren't what they appear to be, and are instead <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fed-up-with-switch-2-scalpers-nintendo-fans-are-fighting-back/1100-6530806/" data-ref-id="1100-6530806">seemingly part of an anti-scammers/bot resistance</a>.</p><p>Sold listings show numerous people have now paid almost double the console's original retail price--$449, or $499 with Mario Kart World--to secure their console. However, as you scroll through the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=nintendo+switch+2&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&amp;_odkw=switch+2&amp;_osacat=0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">listings</a>, you'll find more than a handful of fake Switch 2s. Going through the listings, some posts have already been taken down. It should be noted that eBay rules state that preorder listings have to be for things coming out within 40 days. June 5, however, is just out of reach at 42. So it's a possibility that maybe these will be removed outright and relisted later.</p><p>While browsing, you'll see a <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/205444784624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2 listed a few bucks less</a> and if you go read the description, it tells you point blank this is not what you're looking for.</p><p>"PRE-ORDER SCREENSHOT ONLY PLEASE NOTE!!!!!: You are ordering a picture of the Nintendo Switch 2. This listing is to fight bots and scalpers. No refunds. You will receive a png image of a switch 2. No console. Message me with any questions or offers!"</p><p>These listings almost outnumber scalpers who are selling at marked-up prices.</p><p>The actual Switch 2 consoles all have a similar description as well, saying the console will be in hand and delivered around June 11. The cheapest I was able to find this morning <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/326548391576" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">was about $715 or best offer</a>, and that's the console and Mario Kart World bundle. For just the console, <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/335927772445" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$650 seems to be as low as it goes</a>. Restocks are expected in the coming days and weeks, and Nintendo's own store will open preorders in May for certain eligible customers. We'll be tracking all of the availability in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 restock guide</a>.</p><p>Preorders were originally scheduled for earlier this month, but were delayed for the US as Nintendo had to reconfigure the dates after President Trump upped tariffs. There was also some initial concern that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">the price would change for the console</a>, but only <a href="https://fandom.slack.com/archives/C07QX8B2GNN/p1745508506556539?thread_ts=1745507990.523329&amp;cid=C07QX8B2GNN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some Switch 2 accessories'</a> prices were raised to balance the hit.</p>
