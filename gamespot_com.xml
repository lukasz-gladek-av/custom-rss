                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> is shortening its seasons, which that, going forward, a new hero will be added to the roster once a month. This change will start with Season 3, which should start sometime in the July to August timeframe.</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuv0tO_aLI">Marvel Rivals Season 2 Dev Vision</a>, starting with Season 3, Marvel Rivals seasons will be two months long instead of three, with heroes arriving at the start and midpoints of each season. This means that heroes will drop about once a month, adding new characters to the roster at a fast pace. For reference, Overwatch 2 seasons last a similar length, but new heroes are only added every 2-3 seasons, or about six months in between new heroes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOuv0tO_aLI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="51">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LOuv0tO_aLI?start=51" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 of Marvel Rivals, which will see the addition of Emma Frost at launch on April 11 for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-hellfire-gala-theme-sees-heroes-and-villains-dressed-to-impress/1100-6530596/">Hellfire Gala season</a>, with Ultron arriving at the season midpoint, roughly six weeks from the start. Season 1 saw the addition of all four members of the Fantastic Four, but NetEase said that future seasons would only feature two new characters. A shorter season could also mean shorter battle passes, but NetEase said it would be sharing more details about any changes in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also revealed that Season 2 will see the introduction of new color options for popular skins--although it wasn't clear if these would require an additional purchase--and the ability to gift skins to other players. It also revealed new team-ups, including one for Captain America and Winter Soldier, in addition to updates for older ones. A few being removed altogether, like the team-up for Thor, Captain America, and Storm. Season 2 of Marvel Rivals arrives on April 11.</p>
