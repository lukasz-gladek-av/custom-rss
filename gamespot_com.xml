                <p>The next PS5 system update is coming soon, and it adds a new wireless controller-pairing feature, while Sony also discussed a "Power Saver" mode that's coming later.</p><p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/new-ps5-system-update-beta-previews-dualsense-wireless-controller-pairing-across-multiple-devices/?sf278016696=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Sony said the DualSense controller and other PS5 peripherals were designed to support PC, Mac, and mobile devices, and the new update makes it easier to pair controllers to multiple devices simultaneously. This should make it "easier to switch between them without needing to pair each time," Sony said.</p><p>With the update, players can pair up to four devices simultaneously. Currently, users have to pair each time they connected a controller to a different device. As an example, Sony said you'll be able to take your paired DualSense controller and "seamlessly" switch to PC or a smartphone.</p><p>Below you can find instructions on how to pair a DualSense controller to multiple devices and how to switch between them. The instructions were written by Sony.</p><h3><strong>How to pair a DualSense controller to multiple devices:</strong></h3><ol><li>Make sure the light bar and player indicator on your controller is off. If they're turned on, press and hold the PS button until they turn off.</li><li>Press and hold one of the action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, or square) and the PS button for over 5 seconds. The light bar and player indicator flash two times.</li><li>Turn on Bluetooth on your device, and select the option to add Bluetooth devices. Your device detects nearby Bluetooth devices.</li><li>Select your controller from the detected devices. The light bar lights up, and the player indicator’s lights blink according to the slot number.</li></ol><h3><strong>How to switch between devices:</strong></h3><ol><li>Turn on the device you want to connect to.</li><li>Press and hold one of the action buttons and the PS button for about 3 seconds. When the light bar and player indicator blink, release both buttons. The light bar lights up, and the player indicator’s lights blink according to the slot number.</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537149" data-ratio="0.32657417289221" data-width="1874" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4537149"></a><figcaption>Four slots are available.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4537149-screenshot2025-07-23at9.12.42am.png"></figure><p>As for the Power Saver mode, this is a new mode that allows select PS5 games to "run with lower power consumption" to help "reduce environmental impact." This is part of Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" rel="nofollow ">"Road to Zero" environmental plan</a> that aims to achieve "net-zero greenhouse gas emissions" by 2040.</p><p>With Power Saver mode enabled, select PS5 games will "scale back performance" to help the PS5 system reduce power consumption. As for what the scaled back performance will be, Sony said VR mode and "some gameplay features" may be limited in Power Saver mode.</p><p>"We'll share more details on this new option as we get closer to launch, including supported PS5 games and estimated impact, so stay tuned," Sony said.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-facing-new-criticisms-over-xbox-one-ener/1100-6426634/" data-ref-id="1100-6426634">launched an energy-saving mode for Xbox more than 10 years ago.</a> An <a href="https://www.cnet.com/science/features/ps5-xbox-series-x-and-the-climate-crisis-facing-next-gen-video-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investigation from CNET in 2020</a> found that Sony and Microsoft made progress in improving energy efficiency with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but energy use in the newest games was "significantly higher than the previous generation."</p>

                <p>According to one gaming analyst, the best-selling new PlayStation 5 game based on copies sold is Microsoft's Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft launched the game on PS5 at the end of March this year, and it recently eclipsed 3 million copies sold on PS5 to become the console's best-selling game of 2025, according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/forza-horizon-5-is-now-2025s-top?just_subscribed=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Alinea</a>. </p><p>The research company said the recent sale on Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, which brought the price down to $45, helped the game surpass 3 million sales on Sony's platform.</p><p>Alinea added that Forza Horizon 5 is a juggernaut on Xbox, reaching more than 45 million players on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S through sales and Game Pass downloads. The game is reportedly performing well on Steam, too, reaching 6.5 million copies sold, Alinea said.</p><p>The company further predicted that the inevitable Forza Horizon 6 will launch on PS5 on day one. Microsoft has not announced any new Forza Horizon games, however.</p><p>Alinea's report went on to claim that the PS5 and Steam versions of Forza Horizon 5 have generated nearly $400 million in revenue. The research firm said Microsoft's ongoing strategy to release its games on other platforms is part of the company's transition "from a console platform holder to a third-party publisher." Microsoft is not getting out of the hardware business, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">having already confirmed it's making a new hardware platform with AMD</a>. However, Alinea said the company's next system "won't <em>really </em>be a console," but instead could be a "console-like gaming hardware project."</p><p>"Microsoft probably won't <em>market</em> the next Xbox as a PC, but in functionality, it will likely get closer than ever--a console that runs like a PC, integrates deeply with Windows, and supports cloud/hybrid gaming," Alinea said.</p><p>Microsoft has partnered with Asus for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Xbox Rog Ally line of portable systems launching this year.</a> Microsoft was at one point reportedly considering launching its own Xbox device, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-essentially-canceled-report/1100-6532402/" data-ref-id="1100-6532402">that's no longer the plan, it seems.</a></p>

                <p>Resident Evil is lurching back into theaters next year in a new film by Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger. In an interview, Cregger spoke about how he grew up playing the Resident Evil games, and how that love for the Capcom franchise has guided his vision for this new film adaptation of it.</p><p>"I played all of the games. I played Resident Evil 4 a hundred times through. I'm obsessed with it. And so, I just want to tell a story that feels like it's honoring the experience you get when you play the games," Cregger said to <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/resident-evil-reboot-movie-zach-cregger-tease-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>. "I haven't seen the movies; that's just not my thing. But the games are my thing. That's just a playground I just love--I think the movie is going to rip."</p><p>All but one of the previous live-action Resident Evil films were directed by Paul WS Anderson. They were very loose adaptations of the games, remixing ideas from them with original storylines centered around Milla Jovovich's character of Alice. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-movie-director-says-hes-expecting-online-hate-and-heres-why/1100-6533133/" data-ref-id="1100-6533133">Cregger doesn't want to be slavishly obedient</a> to the lore of the games, but as he explained in a separate interview earlier this month, he isn't planning to break "any major rules" of the franchise with his spin on it. Overall, the director says that he just wants to "tell a story that just feels authentic to the experience you get when you play the games."</p><p>In the video game department, the next Resident Evil game is scheduled to be released in February 2026. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil: Requiem</a> will see players travel back to the ruins of Raccoon City for a new survival-horror experience, and it'll be coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. A mobile spin-off game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-newly-revealed-resident-evil-game-is-not-what-youd-expect/1100-6532940/" data-ref-id="1100-6532940">Resident Evil: Survival Unit</a> is also in development, and Cregger's Resident Evil film is targeting a September 18 release date next year.</p>
