                <p>Actor Ron Perlman is known in Fallout fandom for delivering the now-iconic voice line, "War. War never changes." Perlman will forever be associated with this line and Fallout in general, and now the actor has revealed how he was compensated for the original Fallout game.</p><p>"They invited me to do the very first Fallout and gave me $40 and a sandwich," he said in a recent appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thejoevulpispodcast/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Joe Vulpis Podcast</a>, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-and-a-sandwich-for-his-first-fallout-role-3304278/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by Dexerto.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrITTwBuAUA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TrITTwBuAUA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The original Fallout game, which was made by Interplay, was released in 1997. It wasn't until some time later that Perlman became aware of the phenomenon that became Fallout.</p><p>"A year and a half later, I get a call, 'Hey, you remember Fallout?' No. 'Well, there's a second one.' I go, 'Why?' ‘Because the first one went through the f**king roof,'" he remembered thinking. "I go, 'Really? Cool.' Do the second one, then the third, fourth, and now it's a whole brand."</p><p>Also in the interview, Perlman said he's never played the Fallout games or spent any time with the development teams. "No. I did a couple of lines, got my $40 and my sandwich, and went home," he said.</p><p>Crucially, Perlman did not disclose what kind of sandwich he got for his work on Fallout.</p><p>Fallout 2 was developed by Black Isle Studios, before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-developing-and-publishing-fallout-3/1100-6102349/" data-ref-id="1100-6102349">Bethesda swooped in and bought the rights to the series in 2007</a> and made Fallout 3, released in 2008, as its first entry in the series. Bethesda would go on to release Fallout 4 in 2015 and Fallout 76 in 2018 (2010's Fallout: New Vegas was developed by Obsidian and published by Bethesda). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> is now in development, but it's not coming anytime soon.</p><p>On the more immediate horizon, it's been reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">Bethesda is working on remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. </a></p><p>In other Fallout news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-release-date-schedule/1100-6536675/" data-ref-id="1100-6536675">Prime Video's Fallout TV series is airing now</a>, with Episode 5 having just released today, January 14.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> is getting a very short update in the middle of January, but it's one that was needed to nerf the power of two weapons: the Trigger 'Nade and Kettle. Embark Studios acknowledged the issues with both when laying out the details for Arc Raiders' 1.11.0 update.</p><p>According to <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-11-0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Embark</a>, the Kettle's maximum fire rate of 600 was "only realistically reachable by players using macros." In other words, it played right into the hands of cheaters who were using outside software for an unfair advantage in the game. After the update, the Kettle can only reach a maximum fire rate of 450.</p><p>Similarly, Embark noted that the Trigger 'Nade was dominating PvP battles and players used it more than any other grenade in the game. The nerf for this weapon is limiting the radius of damage to the center of the explosion and increasing the time it takes to detonate to 1.5 seconds to give opposing players a chance to react when it's deployed. This was also meant to make it harder for players to use it as a "trigger-in-air" grenade.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190" data-ratio="0.51384615384615" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635190"></a><figcaption>The Abyss set cosmetics from Arc Raiders.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4635190-arcraidersabyssset2.jpg"></figure><p>The Abyss cosmetic set is also coming to the game with this update. The description notes that "the scyring techno-eye stapled to the front of its helm might not be operational, but it's certainly intimidating."</p><p>Embark acknowledged previous reports about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">Arc Rangers selling 12 million copies</a> and celebrated by giving all players who joined before January 13 the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-players-get-this-free-pickaxe-as-game-passes-12-million-copies-sold/1100-6537346/" data-ref-id="1100-6537346">Gilded Pickaxe Raider Tool</a>." Additionally, Embark has promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-promises-new-anti-cheating-measures-are-coming-soon/1100-6537291/" data-ref-id="1100-6537291">introduce more anti-cheat measures</a> to Arc Raiders in the near future.</p><p>The complete notes for Arc Raiders' January Update 1.11.0 are included below.</p><h2>Arc Raiders January Update 1.11.0 Notes</h2><h3>Kettle</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Reduced fire rate from 600 to 450. The previous fire rate was only realistically reachable by players using macros, which creates an unfair dynamic that favors using 3rd party software.</li></ul><h3>Trigger 'Nade</h3><ul><li>Dev note: Trigger 'Nade currently dominates PVP encounters, and players favor picking it over all our other grenades. This nerf aims to make it less usable as a "trigger-in-air" grenade, whilst keeping its usefulness as a sticky bomb. Damage falloff has been rebalanced to concentrate the damage closer to the center of the explosion, and deal less damage further away. The delay between triggering the grenade and it detonating, has been increased from 0.7s to 1.5s, giving players more time to react, and making it harder to time the detonation in air.</li></ul><h2>Bugs</h2><ul><li>Fixed a key card exploit that allowed players to keep room keys after using them.</li><li>Lighting has been lowered in some areas on Stella Montis Night Raid making flashlights and listening more relevant.</li></ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite the supposedly top secret nature of this evidence, People Make Games was able to make an appointment to view the documents, as Rockstar had not applied for reporting restrictions to be placed upon the evidence. He has now reproduced those messages in full, showing an apparent conversation by a fired employee who was frustrated at not being able to book time off after Rockstar started cracking down on the number of employees being granted leave at one time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnuipPQDd_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dnuipPQDd_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"They mentioned the large session we did today 'being difficult to do,' but that was 32 players, not sure how that was difficult," the former employee wrote in the Discord, after mentioning they worked in a team of 56 people. "Sounds like 'you have multiple studios of QA testers, surely someone can manage to organize a 32-player session and let people have their time off' ..." added another employee who was also fired in the wake of the messages.</p><p>Rockstar's argument refers to these messages as "highly confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to the content and features of an unannounced online service," saying that the information constitutes a leak because it "discussed the specific number of online players planned for this new service."</p><p>Presuming the 32-player number is the planned cap for GTA 6's online play, the revelation isn't exactly a bombshell, as the current iteration of GTA Online already allows 32 players to a server. The new information seems to contradict <a href="https://fravilys.medium.com/que-pr%C3%A9pare-rockstar-games-pour-la-prochaine-version-de-gta-online-b1d1c91ec329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors</a> that circulated last year, suggesting that an upgraded edition of GTA Online would allow 64 players at a time, with the intention of eventually supporting 96-player servers.</p><p>Some of the other messages that were submitted by Rockstar as grounds for the firing are also interesting, not because they contain important information on GTA 6, but for what the studio is classifying as "gross misconduct." In some cases, it's employees discussing crunch, concerns about generative AI, or changes to certain perks provided by Rockstar.</p><p>In one case highlighted by People Make Games, it's a single, 15-word message: "Nothing that I've heard in North QA! Will keep you updated if that changes ofc." Rockstar's grounds for dismissing this employee was that he "included information about working patterns in his team," which could be used by those familiar with the industry to guess what stage of development GTA 6 was at.</p><p>The preliminary hearing was only the first stage in the court battle between Rockstar and the union, with the judge asked to rule on whether Rockstar should be made to provide "interim relief" for the fired employees while they await the results of the full trial. The request for interim relief was rejected by the Glasgow Employment Tribunal, but the full trial is still to come.</p>
