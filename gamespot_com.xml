                <p dir="ltr">Ads for four unconfirmed Activision mobile games--Guitar Hero Mobile, Call Of Duty: Sniper, and Call Of Duty: Zombies Defender, and Crash Bandicoot Brawl--all allegedly feature what players believe to be AI-generated art.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes just a few days after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/">Activision admitted to using AI-generated assets in Black Ops 6</a>. Additionally, it appears that some of these mobile games may not even exist, as only Guitar Hero Mobile has been officially acknowledged on Activision's social media.</p><p dir="ltr">The ads for these rumored games are reportedly appearing on Facebook and Instagram, and contain a link to a survey where players can share their opinions on the games, which have not yet been released.</p><p dir="ltr">The Guitar Hero Mobile ad in particular seems to have truly upset players who have viewed it. Art for the game features four oddly shaped guitarists, each holding an even more oddly shaped red guitar. The strange look of the ads doesn't appear to be the result of Activision trying out a new art style, but instead features what players believe to be the hallmarks of AI-generated art: blurry, oddly shaped, and non-cohesive assets.</p><p dir="ltr">Even stranger, it appears that some of these mobile games may not actually exist. Guitar Hero Mobile, Crash Bandicoot Brawl, and the Call Of Duty titles have yet to be officially announced by Activision, and Guitar Hero Mobile is the only game with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DGn9-qkAR3F/" rel="nofollow ">an ad that's viewable</a> outside of Facebook and Instagram ads.</p><p dir="ltr">Eagle-eyed fans did manage to dig up a <a href="https://store.geeklab.app/p/f6c46a6e325cb82fbb206399" rel="nofollow ">Guitar Hero Mobile page on Geeklab</a>, a mobile marketing platform that helps developers gauge player interest. Geeklab's website says it exists to "create app store pages before the app is released, test product pages, research competitors, build assets, run surveys, run A/B tests, and optimize app stores." Clicking "get" on the Guitar Hero Mobile page <a href="https://lab.geeklab.app/survey/7562005b447f52556c832f82?tq=267a0d4c6151982266fa5a03d97051&amp;pid=3252054" rel="nofollow ">takes players to a survey</a> (also hosted on the Geeklab site).</p><p dir="ltr">The two Call Of Duty titles and the Crash Bandicoot Brawl mobile game do not yet appear to have Geeklab pages, nor do they have official pages on Activision's website, but Facebook and Instagram users are asserting that ads for all three games--plus Guitar Hero Mobile--are regularly running on the two Meta-owned social media sites. Art featured on the Guitar Hero Mobile Geeklab page also appears to include AI-generated assets, according to players. In addition to the bizarre shape of the guitarists and their instruments, the speakers on the stage appear to be facing in multiple directions at once.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thank you Activision," reads one sarcastic player comment on the Guitar Hero Mobile Instagram post. "Thank you for killing any interest I may have had in your games. Makes not supporting you way easier."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision declined to comment when asked about these ads and their reported use of AI-generated assets.</p>

The visuals also received a significant overhaul, and the 23-year-old game looks nice on modern consoles. The graphical upgrades coupled with the chilling soundtrack help create a tense and unsettling atmosphere.

That would have meant Season 3 starts on March 20, but now <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641" rel="nofollow ">Activision has announced April 3</a> as the official start date for the new season.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Season 03 is a big moment for Call of Duty: Warzone and Black Ops 6, and we’re taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on April 3. <br>More to come following Call of Duty: Warzone’s 5th anniversary next week… <a href="https://t.co/TmPJnoYBZS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/TmPJnoYBZS</a></p>  — Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1896636715143704641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">"We're taking the time to deliver a great experience starting on April 3," the publisher says in the announcement made on X/Twitter.</p><p dir="ltr">This likely means that Season 2 will get an updated battle pass timer, and the season will be extended. Delays are unfortunate, but this means players should hopefully get more time than they originally expected to finish earning all the rewards in the Season 2 battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">While Activision doesn't give any details on why Season 3 is being described as a big moment for Black Ops 6 and Warzone, speculation is high that this will be an OG-style season of content and the return of Verdansk.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision says more Season 3 details will be revealed following Warzone's 5th year anniversary on March 10.

                <p>Despite Activision's efforts to curb cheating among some Call of Duty players, it remains an issue even in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Black Ops. 6</a>. But now, there's potentially cause for celebration among CoD fans as Phantom Overlay, one of the most prominent cheat developers, has announced that it is shutting down.</p><p>Via <a href="https://gamerant.com/call-of-duty-phantom-overlay-cheat-provider-shut-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Rant</a>, Phantom Overlay's <a href="https://t.me/PhantomOverlayAnnouncements/1052" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Telegram channel</a> states that it plans to "immediately" close its operations, with a caveat that it will remain online for at least another month to fulfill the 30-day keys that it has already sold players. Phantom Overlay went on to promise that anyone who bought lifetime keys would get a partial refund.</p><p>"This is not an exit scam and no external entity could ever compel me to exit scam my customers," wrote the creator of Phantom Overlay. "I'll keep everything updated, safe, and online for 32 days longer."</p><p>There was no information in the post about why Phantom Overlay is closing down, and <a href="https://x.com/Beyond_Dark_TM/status/1896214682727579879" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some players online are naturally skeptical</a>. Phantom Overlay successfully monetized CoD cheats, and the creator could theoretically try again with a different company or a new alias. As noted by one user on X, Phantom Overlay's cheats <a href="https://twitter.com/InsuredFrames/status/1896052805653426600" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were reputed to be undetectable</a>, while rival cheat-makers have struggled with that.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/27000-call-of-duty-cheaters-were-banned-this-past-weekend/1100-6522492/" data-ref-id="1100-6522492">27,000 CoD cheaters were banned in a single weekend</a>. Activision's Call of Duty anti-cheat program, Ricochet, shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheaters-may-now-lose-their-parachutes-sending-them-plummeting-to-their-death/1100-6519058/" data-ref-id="1100-6519058">its ambitious anti-cheat CoD plans</a>, but Activision has previously apologized for not being able to kick cheaters out of Black Ops. 6 ranked play as quickly as promised. Activision has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-call-of-duty-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-3-million-to-activision/1100-6511845/" data-ref-id="1100-6511845">sued cheat developers in the past</a>, and successfully won a $3 million judgment against them. Regardless, the battle between Activision and the cheaters will likely continue well into the future regardless of whether Phantom Overlay makes a comeback under a new name. In the meantime, Activision has launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-recon-squad-announced-but-its-not-a-new-game/1100-6529557/" data-ref-id="1100-6529557">Call of Duty: Recon Squad</a> to get more feedback from players.</p>
