                <p>Bigfoot isn't a myth. It's real, and it's really wandering around the forests ... in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, as a new update added the mythical sasquatch to the battle royale shooter.</p><p>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1999102778430374329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent 39.10 update</a> that landed on December 11, players noticed something strange in Fortnite's woods. Apparently, Epic Games introduced Bigfoot to the game's sprawling world, but it isn't easy to find. Bigfoot roams the entire map, meaning it could appear by the Fore Fields, near the Humble Hills, and anywhere in between. It's also immune to damage, so shooting it means nothing. And if you get within 35 meters, it vanishes, leaving you on yet another wild sasquatch hunt before getting blasted to death.</p><p>Contrary to its name, however, Bigfoot isn't that big. As players found it, <a href="https://x.com/Dashybear/status/1999117362537037986" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">it actually appears rather little</a>. The perspective could be off, but <a href="https://x.com/NexusFNx/status/1999114419301650916" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">based on screenshots circulating on X</a>, Bigfoot looks no bigger than a budding flower. Maybe it should be known as "Littlefoot," then.</p><p>This isn't the first time Bigfoot made an appearance in Fortnite. The mythical creature was a purchasable outfit in 2019, but this is its first addition as a random NPC.</p><p>While Bigfoot ducks and dodges Fortnite's gunfights, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian is gearing up to serve looks</a> and bullets. The social media star will join the battle royale shooter on December 13, with all the glitz and glam you'd expect.</p>

                <p>A new report detailed how much it costs for developers to have their games shown off at The Game Awards. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku reported</a> that a 60-second trailer can cost up to $450,000, with the price scaling to $1 million for a three-minute trailer.</p><p>The ad sales team for The Game Awards can charge that much due in part to the show's massive scale. The Game Awards 2024 drew an audience of 154 million livestreams, which was up from 118 million for The Game Awards 2023. This counts streams on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, X, Instagram, Facebook, and international platforms like Bilibili and WeChat in China, among other sources.</p><p>The viewership number for The Game Awards 2024 was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lix-averages-record-audience-of-127-7-million-viewers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many millions higher than the latest Super Bowl (127.7 million)</a>, but the comparison is not apples to apples. Super Bowl ads for Super Bowl LIX this past February <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/43610365/some-commercials-super-bowl-lix-sold-8m-per-reports" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reportedly cost as much as $8 million for 30 seconds.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted the organizers of The Game Awards for comment on ad pricing.</p><p>People have criticized The Game Awards for appearing to be more of a marketing event for upcoming games as opposed to a celebration of developers and their achievements. Each year, people regularly criticize the event for zipping through the awards themselves and giving developers a limited time to speak while time and attention is paid to trailers and advertisements from sponsors.</p><p>Host and organizer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-creator-hears-your-feedback-do-we-always-get-it-right-no/1100-6536808/" data-ref-id="1100-6536808">recently responded to these concerns</a>, saying "it is a balancing act."</p><p>"There's the awards aspect of the show, there's the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements," he said.</p><p>Keighley went on to say that the promise of new and exciting game reveals helps raise the profile of The Game Awards and inspires more people to tune in. At the same time, if more people watch, The Game Awards can in theory charge more for ad placement.</p><p>"My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show. And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they're seen by a lot of people," he said. "Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. Balatro had a huge boost. So hopefully it's a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don't always get it right."</p><p>The Kotaku report also mentioned that The Game Awards gives developers who are nominated for awards at least two tickets to attend the ceremony. Tickets to The Game Awards are available to the general public, and Expedition 33 developer Sandfall was reported to have "bought a swath of tickets" at around $300 each to help more staffers attend the show. Expedition 33 picked up 12 total nominations, the most ever for a game, including Game of the Year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6536768/" data-ref-id="1100-6536768">how to watch and what to expect from The Game Awards.</a></p>
