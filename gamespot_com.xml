                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is offline right now, but fortunately it's not because anything is wrong. Quite the opposite, in fact--Fortnite is down because of routine scheduled maintenance that Epic does with every update. In this case, the update is a big one: the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">Fortnite battle royale Chapter 6 Season 2</a>, featuring major changes to the island, piles of new weapons and gadgets, and the arrival of Sub-Zero from Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Chapter 6 got off to quite a bang during Season 1, as Fortnite introduced the permanent OG mode with its own separate battle pass, and also the Counter-Strike-esque Ballistic mode. In January, the season ramped up once more with the addition of the player-controlled Godzilla boss and the arrival of Hatsune Miku in Festival. But all things must come to an end--we had our fun with the ridiculous Typhoon Blade, but now it's time to move on to less civilized weapons, like the big drill weapon we saw in the trailer.</p><h2><strong>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 start time</strong></h2><p>When the servers come back up, it'll be Lawless season, which is all about committing armed robbery. That's right, it's Fortnite's fourth heist-themed season. But where the past seasons like this had more of a classy bent, Lawless season is going to be more in the vein of Grand Theft Auto--mayhem is the name of the game here.</p><p>Since we're already in downtime, the wait shouldn't be too long. Fortnite went offline at 2 AM ET/11 PM PT, and season updates typically take somewhere in the ballpark of 4-7 hours. If all goes well, you could be fragging away in Crime City by 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET. But don't take that as a given--when Chapter 5 Season 2 launched a year ago, something went wrong, and Fortnite stayed offline until the evening. But that was a very unusual case. Most seasons launch between 4 AM - 7 AM PT / 7 AM - 10 AM ET.</p><p>Every new battle royale season dramatically changes the gameplay meta, and Season 2 will not be an exception. This crime-fueled season will add a new urban location, Crime City, as well as a bundle of new tools, like timed explosives, sticky grenades, and a rocket drill, that will help you steal gold and whatever else you can find. For more on what you can expect in Season 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-6-season-2-start-date-theme-battle-pass-leaks-and-rumors/1100-6529339/" data-ref-id="1100-6529339">check out our rundown here</a>.</p>

                <p>The option to romance NPC characters in RPGs has been around for a long time, and even recent titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-whats-old-is-new-again/1900-6418333/" data-ref-id="1900-6418333">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> offer that feature to players. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a> is bucking that trend by almost completely removing players' ability to court their companions. According to Avowed director Carrie Patel, she made the decision to downplay romance because she felt it takes away from the experience of playing the game.</p><p>While appearing on IGN's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB9qwiskL18&amp;list=PL99PCYdTX-vcBZW5aQAHlTHZr08eO4Vnj&amp;index=1&amp;pp=iAQB" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlocked</a> podcast, Patel revealed that she believes the romantic options in RPGs "undermine that core experience" and practically invite players to focus more on the romance than on the story or even the characters themselves. Instead, Patel favored a more natural form of bonding with the player's companions that doesn't end with two characters in bed.</p><p>"My hope with players and their companion relationships in Avowed is that they would feel natural, and players would get out of them exactly what they want and exactly as much as they put in," said Patel. She added that it was supposed to be like "you're getting to know some new friends."</p><p>That decision may make Avowed an outlier in the genre, especially since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> had so many romantic options to choose from. Thus far, Xbox Game Studios and Obsidian Entertainment haven't announced how many copies Avowed has sold since its release on February 18. The game received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-companions-wont-nag-you-as-much-about-getting-better-armor-after-day-one-patch/1100-6529570/" data-ref-id="1100-6529570">a day-one patch earlier this week</a> to address some of the issues found in it. The developers have previously explained why Avowed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-not-being-open-world-is-a-good-thing-devs-say/1100-6529022/" data-ref-id="1100-6529022">isn't an open-world game</a>, but fortunately there is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-is-full-of-discoveries-and-the-freedom-to-find-them-or-not/1100-6527918/" data-ref-id="1100-6527918">a lot of territory that can be explored</a>.</p><p>Avowed is available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, and subscribers to those services <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">have an option to upgrade to the premium version</a> at a greatly reduced cost.</p>
