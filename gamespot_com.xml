That makes the handheld gaming PC quite expensive, but the device does have some high-quality hardware inside of it.</p><p>Internally, the base model is powered by the AMD Z2 SoC, while the premium model has more power with its AMD Z2 Extreme chip. Other specs include a high amount of LPDDR5X RAM, with the Z2 model getting 16GB and the Z2 Extreme having 32GB. Both of these devices are equipped with a 1TB PCIe SSD--with an option to add up to 2TB of extra storage via MicroSD--an 8.8-inch 1200p OLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate, and a 74Wh battery.</p><p>The Legion Go 2 also has Switch-like functionality, as its TrueStrike controllers are detachable. This allows the unit to shift between handheld, tabletop, console, or FPS modes. Switching to FPS mode is especially interesting, as the TrueStrike controller adopts a joystick position.</p><p>The Legion Go 2 also has an updated thermal design that delivers up to 45% more airflow, 2W speakers with Nahimic and spatial audio, near-field dual mics, and a 3.5mm jack for wired gear. You'll also get a voucher for three months of PC Game Pass, so you'll have a library of games you can access right out of the box, like Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p><div title="Legion Go 2 Z2 and Z2

expected to launch</a> during the holiday season. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Xbox partnered with Asus on this Windows-based handheld</a>, which will be available in a base model and a premium "X" edition.</p><p>The white base model Xbox Ally is equipped with an AMD Ryzen Z2A chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD with a 60Wh battery, while the black Xbox Ally X has an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme APU, 24GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an 80Wh battery. Both devices have the same 7" 1080p screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and in terms of ergonomics, they're designed to feel more comfortable with their sculpted handles. The Xbox Ally targets a resolution of 720p, while the Xbox Ally X aims for a 1080p resolution.</p><p>The other big thing to note here is that both handhelds are running on a version of Windows that's designed to make accessing games easier and smoother. The main issue with Windows-based mobile gaming PCs is that the flexibility they give users with accessing various storefronts is countered by an unintuitive desktop experience. At the end of the day, they're still PCs, and accessing apps on them can be awkward due to the size of the screen.</p><p>With the Xbox Ally, the Xbox App now supports multiple storefronts like Steam, GOG, and Epic Games, allowing you to gather all of your downloaded games into a centralized launcher.</p><p>While the new Legion Go 2 is pricy, you can still get several of the previous models at a lower price. For an entry-level option, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-Legion-Go-graphics-PureSight/dp/B0DTBN55K9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">there's the Lenovo Legion Go S for $650</a>, which has an 8-inch 120Hz Lenovo PureSight display and an AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip with Radeon graphics. This one doesn't have detachable controllers, but with 16GB of RAM and a 512TB SSD, it's still a solid option that can easily play a wide variety of games.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Lenovo+Legion+Go+2+Handheld+Is+Up+For+Preorder&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-05+09%3A06%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-05+09%3A06%3A06&amp;fnarticle_id=6534509&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F614286%2F10014%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.bestbuy.com%252Fproduct%252Flegion-go-8-8-144hz-wqxga-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z1-extreme-16gb-with-512-gb-ssd-windows%252FJJGYCGRK6W&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flenovo-legion-go-2-handheld-is-up-for-preorder%2F1100-6534509%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR58dIoLosBmwqGl1QvJFAwvKmGWjFekTZi5hP-gzEWAMJUeQWETGqGGy0Ko7A_aem_U4hVyuZDhEOxrTS6TgXAfQ&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy also has the first-generation Lenovo Legion Go for $740</a>.

                <p>Subscription services in gaming are popular, and while they are very far from the only way to buy and play games, the profile of the business model is growing thanks in part to the backing of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">multi-trillion-dollar company Microsoft</a> and its Xbox Game Pass service. Pete Hines, the longtime Bethesda marketing and publishing boss who retired after Microsoft bought his company, has now shared his thoughts on subscription services for games--and he has some issues.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines began by saying he doesn't work at Bethesda anymore and is under no assumption that he what he knew when he was there still holds true today. That said, he believes he is involved enough in gaming still today to understand "what I considered to be some short-sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said."</p><p>Hines said his main issue with a subscription service like Game Pass or others is that the economics might not always make sense--and that's a critical point in a world with mass layoffs, studio closures, and game cancellations.</p><p>"Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content--without which your subscription is worth jack sh*t--then you have a real problem," he said.</p><p>Hines went on to say a company behind a subscription service for games needs to "properly acknowledge, compensate, and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product."</p><p>The "tension" inherent in the situation that Hines outlined is "hurting a lot of people," including game developers, Hines said.</p><p>"Because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making," he said.</p><p>These comments appear to be aligned with what Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said about subscription services. While the company might put some older titles on subscription services like Game Pass--and the company has done this with GTA 5--Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">wouldn't launch a brand-new game into Game Pass because of the economics.</a> Zelnick has acknowledged that Microsoft putting Call of Duty on Game Pass will no doubt help drive subscribers to the service, but the executive said this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">may only work "for a period of time."</a></p><p>While Microsoft launches all of its first-party games into Xbox Game Pass on day one, Sony doesn't do this with its own PlayStation Plus membership program. PlayStation's former president Jim Ryan seemed to agree with Zelnick and previously discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">this doesn't make economic sense.</a></p><p>For its part, Electronic Arts has a subscription service called EA Play Pro, and for $17/month, members can get access to the company's newest games at launch. Ubisoft, meanwhile, has a subscription service called Ubisoft+ ($18/month) that allows members to play new releases on day one.</p><p>Of course, subscription services are not the only way to access games today, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-not-for-everybody-phil-spencer-says/1100-6530894/" data-ref-id="1100-6530894">Microsoft has maintained from the onset of Game Pass that it's just one option for players</a>--they can always buy a game outright as well. Still, some fear that the economics of Game Pass could lead to troubled times down the road.</p><p>There has been significant upheaval at Microsoft in recent times, with the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">enacting mass layoffs, cancelling games, and closing at least one studio.</a> For the latest financial year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">Xbox Game Pass generated nearly $5 billion annually for the first time.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Former longtime Bethesda marketing and publishing boss Pete Hines retired after Microsoft bought parent company ZeniMax, and in a new interview, he discussed one part of his career where he did the "dumbest thing."</p><p>Some may recall that one of the promised items in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-edition-sold-out-bethesda-/1100-6461399/" data-ref-id="1100-6461399">Fallout 76's $200 Power Armor Edition</a> was a canvas West Tek bag. However, upon delivery, fans noticed that the bundle came with a low-cost nylon bag instead. Bethesda eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">did right by players</a>, but the events clearly left a mark on Hines.</p><p>He said in an interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a> that the version of the Power Armor Edition that he signed off on did not have a canvas bag. Someone was trying to "add more value" to the premium edition, and while Hines admits to throwing "sh*t fits" from time to time, in this case, "their hearts were in the right place" with the idea to add more value. What happened was that there was "literally a canvas shortage" at the time, and it was decided by "some folks" to include a nylon bag instead.</p><p>"My biggest failing there was not pushing immediately for making and sending one to everybody that wants one. Because I was still annoyed that the damn thing was in there in the first place, and nobody had told me and that this canvas shortage happened. It's probably the dumbest thing I ever did at Bethesda," he said.</p><p>Bethesda initially announced it would compensate purchasers with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-power-armor-edition-flub-leads-to-free-/1100-6463537/" data-ref-id="1100-6463537">500 Atoms for Fallout 76</a>, but players quickly roasted Bethesda for this, as it only amounts to $5 worth of compensation. The company later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76s-power-armor-canvas-bag-flub-update-bet/1100-6463608/" data-ref-id="1100-6463608">allowed purchasers who received a nylon bag to request a canvas bag.</a></p><p>Fallout 76 is still getting new updates and support, with plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-will-have-more-content-based-on-the-tv-show/1100-6533192/" data-ref-id="1100-6533192">more content to come based on the Prime Video Fallout TV series</a>. Looking further out, Bethesda is developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>, but it's not coming until after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, so no one should expect to play it anytime soon.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, the highly anticipated remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, has officially reached a milestone of one million copies sold. This figure, announced by Konami via its official <a href="https://x.com/KONAMIUK/status/1963892658960482616" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Twitter account</a>, represents internal sales tracking rather than third-party verified numbers.</p><p>Still, the milestone marks a significant achievement for the project, which has faced intense scrutiny and pressure given the iconic status of the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. It's on par with sales figures for <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metal_Gear" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">other remakes in the series</a>, and could potentially surpass them given time.</p><p>The milestone is notable not just for the sales figures, but also for the weight of its legacy. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the first major installment in the series since Hideo Kojima, the franchise's creator and longtime creative force, parted ways with Konami in 2015. The spin-off Metal Gear Survive, which was developed after Kojima had left the company, was not well-received.</p><p>Kojima himself was asked earlier this summer whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">he would consider playing the remake of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a>, and his response was candid and dismissive. With a laugh, the legendary designer replied, "No, I won't." While brief, Kojima’s comments highlighted the enduring tension between him and Konami, a rift that has continued to shadow every Metal Gear-related development since their split.</p><p>Solid Snake's original American voice actor, David Hayter, said he would have liked to have been involved with Delta just so he could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/david-hayter-would-have-loved-a-redo-with-metal-gear-solid-delta/1100-6534214/" data-ref-id="1100-6534214">redo a lot of the dialogue</a> which carried over from the 2004 game to the remake. "I do feel that I'm a little better of an actor now than I was then," said Hayter. "It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I've picked up over the past 20 years to it."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
