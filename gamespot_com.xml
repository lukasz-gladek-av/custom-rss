                <p>When Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles was released nearly 25 years ago, it featured a roster of heroes--and a few villains--from Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks was not among the playable characters in the game's original form, but he will be featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/24-year-old-star-wars-game-coming-to-modern-consoles/1100-6527092/" data-ref-id="1100-6527092">the game's upcoming release</a> on modern consoles. In the reveal trailer below, Jar Jar finally gets a chance to become an action hero.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQsFR66qYU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rQsFR66qYU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jar Jar shows far more skill and fighting prowess in that trailer than he ever displayed in The Phantom Menace or any of his subsequent appearances. Regardless, Jar Jar's ridiculous side is also on full display when he runs away from a pack of charging animals on Naboo. Courage was never Jar Jar's strong suit, but it might be fun to play all the way through the game as this unsung hero.</p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn are the two primary controllable characters in Power Battles. However, the game will also allow players to use Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, Queen Padme Amidala, Captain Panaka, Ki-Adi Mundi, a battle droid, and Darth Maul. It's also been tweaked by developer Aspyr to give the Jedi screen-accurate depictions of their respective lightsaber colors. For example, that means Mace Windu will be getting his purple lightsaber.</p><p>Players will be able to fight each other in Power Battles' Versus mode, or they can face the Trade Federation side-by-side in co-op gameplay. This release will also feature Big Head Mode and other cheats that can be used during the main game.</p><p>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles will hit Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 23, 2025. If the game follows the same pattern as Aspyr's previous Star Wars games, there may eventually be a physical edition available through Limited Run Games as well.

"We know it’s not fun to see a 'fix' multiple weeks later for something that wasn’t bothering you in the first place, so we’re reverting the Directed Mode changes, giving Shadow Rift four new buffs, and scheduling a fix to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic in Terminus again. The first two are live now, with the speedrun fix needing some extra testing before it goes live."</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also thanks players for bringing attention to various bugs, including one that caused visual effects in Citadelle des Morts to display improperly and one that caused the game to crash if players wielded a sword while Aether Shroud is active with the Void Sheath augment. Activision says these bugs have been squashed as of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the changes to Zombies, the new update also includes general stability improvements, an increase in match bonus XP for Red Light, Green Light, and a fix for the bug that caused Maya's Joyride skin to become invisible at 70 meters and beyond. Various UI bugs and an audio issue affecting event milestone banners have also been addressed.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes are listed in full below.</p><h2>Thursday, January 9 Patch Notes:</h2><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h4>Characters</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where Maya’s “Joyride” Operator Skin would not be visible past 70 meters.</li></ul><h4>UI</h4><ul><li>Addressed some visual issues with the Events tab.</li></ul><h4>Audio</h4><ul><li>Addressed an issue where audio was not playing for Event milestone banners in-game.</li></ul><h3>MULTIPLAYER</h3><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Red Light, Green Light</b><ul><li>Increased XP awarded from match bonus.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Added various stability fixes.</li></ul><h3>ZOMBIES</h3><p><em>Hey everyone, let’s talk about those changes from January 3rd. The team is always focused on making Zombies fun and rewarding (it’s why we make video games!), but we don’t always nail it the first time.</em></p><p><em>Some fixes for bugs or exploits can become lower priority as more important issues come up, and some need to be held for an update further down the line. Last Friday’s changes to Big Game for Shadow Rift, the Shock Charge speedrun step for Terminus, and Directed Mode spawn delays after 5 looped rounds are prime examples of these.</em><br><em>We know it’s not fun to see a “fix” multiple weeks later for something that wasn’t bothering you in the first place, so we’re reverting the Directed Mode changes, giving Shadow Rift four new buffs, and scheduling a fix to allow speedrunners to safely use the Shock Charge tactic in Terminus again. The first two are live now, with the speedrun fix needing some extra testing before it goes live.</em></p><p><em>Thanks to everyone for the reports of visual FX not showing properly in Citadelle des Morts and crashes that can happen when you’re using a sword while Aether Shroud is active with the Void Sheath Augment. The team produced fixes for these bugs shortly after they popped up, and they’re live today.</em></p><h4>Maps</h4><ul><li><b>Citadelle des Morts</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where using the Void Sheath Augment for Aether Shroud with one of the Elemental Swords would cause the match to crash.</li><li>Addressed an issue where many visual effects would stop playing.</li><li>Directed Mode  <ul><li>Addressed an issue where guidance would be incorrect if a player disconnected with a stamp.</li><li>Addressed an issue where guidance would be incorrect each time a new stamp spawned.</li><li>Addressed an issue where picking up Solais after a stamp was spawned could prevent quest progression.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h4>Modes</h4><ul><li><b>Directed Mode</b><ul><li>Removed the extended time between rounds and the delay between spawning zombies after five looped rounds at the round cap.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>Ammo Mods</h4><ul><li><b>Shadow Rift</b><ul><li><b>Activation Rates</b><ul><li>Normal enemy activation rate increased from 15% to 20%.</li><li>Special enemy activation rate increased from 5% to 7%.</li><li>Elite enemy activation rate with Big Game Augment equipped increased from 5% to 7%.</li></ul></li><li><b>Cooldown Timer</b><ul><li>Decreased cooldown by 25%.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p><em>The Big Game Augment for Shadow Rift was never intended to one-shot Elites, but we know it worked like that for months and we heard you about this latest change taking too much away from Shadow Rift overall. So, we’ve added four buffs to make Shadow Rift activate more frequently, including a 25% cooldown reduction, to keep it powerful and fun to use.</em></p><h4>LTM Highlights / Adjustments</h4><ul><li><b>Dead Light, Green Light</b><ul><li>Added Liberty Falls to map selection.</li><li>Increased round cap to 20 before Exfil.</li></ul></li></ul><p><em>With the launch of Dead Light, Green Light, we wanted to ease players into the LTM with a single map and a 10-Round cap before Exfil to make sure the majority of players had a chance to be successful without feeling they needed GobbleGums to survive. Basically, a bite-sized experience that’s not too punishing. Looks like it was too easy and over too soon for a lot of you!</em></p><p><em>Starting today, we’ve added Liberty Falls to the map selection and extended the round cap to 20. After that, we’ll plan Week 3’s round cap extension based on how crazy the community wants the challenge to get.</em></p><h4>Stability</h4><ul><li>Various stability fixes.</li></ul><p><em>Sometimes bugs appear fixed in testing but turn out to still be an issue in the live game after the patch goes out. This sucks for everyone involved, and it can lead to inaccurate patch notes, which we never want. The Vermin double-attack bug is one of these, and like the Terminus speedrun fix, the proper solution for it unfortunately can’t be implemented as quickly as some of the other items listed above. Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</em></p>
