                <p>It's not an easy life for Sanctuary's citizens in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a>, but players can make things a little brighter in the upcoming holiday event Goblin Greedings. Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><p>Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:</p><ul><li><strong>December 18</strong>: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 19</strong>: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 20</strong>: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)</li></ul><p>As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.</p><p>Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a>, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">is available for preorder now</a>.
