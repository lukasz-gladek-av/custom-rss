                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking. Now, any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time. Accounts that fail to complete this step will be locked from use on the PC platform until the security check is completed.

This includes the white-screen bug that prevented some players from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">main story quest for Shattered Veil</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, the update makes changes to the game's ground loot. The DM-10 marksman rifle, Tsarkov marksman rifle, and the SVD sniper rifle are removed from supply boxes and ground loot.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h2>GLOBAL</h2><h3>Ricochet Anti-Cheat</h3><p>We’ve rolled out changes to account linking as described <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">in a blog from #TeamRicochet</a> ahead of Season 03.</p><p>These changes will provide additional security to players with multiple platforms linked to their ATVI ID.</p><p>Account Linking Update</p><ul><li>Any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time.</li><li>Not completing this verification check will lock the account from use on the PC platform only until completed.</li><li>Read more <a href="http://callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">about this policy change here</a>, and visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/keeping-your-activision-account-secure" rel="nofollow ">Keeping your Activision Account Secure</a> periodically for account security best practices.</li></ul><p>From the Ricochet Blog on 3/28:</p><p>Account Linking Changes</p><p>In a proactive effort to protect our players, we’re adjusting account linking shortly after the launch of Season 03. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform. Players will see an in-game notification if this occurs, locking gameplay on the new platform until the authentication has been completed.</p><p>If you receive an email notification about a platform link or login attempt you did not initiate, visit CallofDuty.com to login and immediately unlink the account and update your password.</p><p>Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites. Reusing passwords on other apps or websites in connection with your email can open the door to your account being stolen or hijacked.

"[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys.

However, there will also be improvements to the GameCube version when it lands on Switch 2. Games can receive a resolution boost and faster loading times, as well as online multiplayer functionality.</p><p>There were rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-and-wind-waker-switch-release-rumored-for-2022/1100-6503137/" data-ref-id="1100-6503137">Wind Waker and Twilight Princess</a> being ported to the first Switch several years ago, but those never came to fruition. However, it seems like that still might be possible with Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

Players have complained that the new spear-wielding Huntress class feels weak, aren't happy about huge nerfs to popular endgame builds, and are annoyed by unannounced changes to the campaign that made it a slog to play through.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Grinding Gear Games has been quick to respond. In an April 6 <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, GGG addressed some of the main concerns players took issue with, explaining some of the changes it had already made or were looking to make in order to right the ship. Those changes came in the form of reduced health for some basic monsters, improvements to the Huntress (including a new skill), and restoring some of the power of minions in the early game while still keeping their power in check as they progress into the endgame.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="575974216" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

nofollow">post</a> on April 7 outlined all the ways the team was listening to player complaints about the game's massive Act 3 maps (something, it's worth noting, that wasn't changed as part of the update). GGG confirmed it will be making them flow better, require less running around, and in some cases, smaller in size. Then on April 8, even more changes were <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/497192510562500616?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a>, this time focused on buffs to underperforming class skills, improvements to crafting, and reducing monster speed in areas with lots of fast monsters that can easily overwhelm players.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the rapid fixes, Path of Exile 2 is sitting at "Mixed" recent reviews on Steam, although it still sports an "Overwhelmingly Positive" rating overall. In a recent interview with Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YiFLwjFI4S4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zizaran</a>, Path of Exile 2 game directors Mark Roberts and Jonathan Rogers admitted some mistakes were made with Dawn of the Hunt, stating that many of the changes players complained about, especially in regards to the campaign, were unintended and meant to target endgame builds that were making endgame content "trivial."</p><p dir="ltr">"The first thing we thought was 'What the hell, we didn't even nerf the campaign," Rogers said in the interview. "Literally that's what a lot of developers were saying. 'We didn't nerf this, why is everyone saying we nerfed it?' We found a few things but we are still looking for what those things are. It's not always necessarily obvious with all the changes that you make."</p><p dir="ltr">Roberts said the team has adopted a "firing from the hip" approach given the game is in early access, and that if a change doesn't work out and is bad, they can simply undo it. That led to what Roberts said were some "pretty blatant f***-ups" in regards to things like some monsters having more life than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">Rogers went on to explain part of what he believes is one of the developer's main challenges with Path of Exile 2--that due to its slower-paced combat and intentionally higher-difficulty, GGG needs to be much more precise when it comes to getting the game's balance right. This is unlike in the original Path of Exile, where over a decade after its release, knowledgeable players can easily blast through everything in the game from the very start. It's for that reason GGG worries about reducing Path of Exile 2's difficulty too much, as Rogers said he thinks it would result in a game that isn't fun in the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">"If we get balance numbers wrong, if a monster has double life by accident in PoE 1, it doesn't even really matter," Rogers said. "Whereas if a monster has double life in PoE 2, it matters a lot. The threshold for what is right is way tighter in PoE 2 and that means it will just take longer to balance and get it all correct."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-into-path-of-exile-2-early-access/1100-6527842/" data-ref-id="1100-6527842">Path of Exile 2 is available in paid early access now</a> but will eventually be free-to-play.
