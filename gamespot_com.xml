                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> Season 1 is just a few days away, but Battlefield Studios is already looking to make changes ahead of time while laying out a path for future updates. Towards that end, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-changes-detailed-before-it-even-launches/1100-6535682/" data-ref-id="1100-6535682">shared the improvements</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">battle royale mode</a> before it even launched. Now, the rest of the upcoming improvement plans have been released.</p><p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Studios</a>, its current focus is on improving the game's overall performance and enhancing the combat experience. The following updates are now active:</p><h3>Live Now</h3><ul><li><strong>Custom Search:</strong> We’ve made some adjustments to improve how accurately matchmaking aligns with your selected map and mode preferences. The system still maintains flexibility to support reasonable queue times, so players with more specific selections may notice slightly longer waits. We’ll keep monitoring Custom Search performance and continue fine-tuning as needed.</li><li><strong>Vehicle Spawn Bug:</strong> We recently deployed a targeted backend change to address an issue where vehicles could sometimes fail to spawn as expected across certain maps and modes. The current results have shown that it has greatly reduced the number of occurrences and started to improve the balance issues on some map/mode combinations. We are aware of a few outliers that this fix did not address, and we’re working on a fix to resolve these outstanding issues. We also saw that this backend change had a slightly positive impact on Breakthrough win rates, but we are working on further balancing changes that are meant to be more impactful and bring the win rates into a better state.</li><li><strong>Portal Server Availability:</strong> Earlier this week, we made XP adjustments for Community Experiences. In case you missed it, check out the details</li></ul><p>The dev team went on to say that upcoming changes are planned for refining player movement and enhancing the sight stability during certain character animations. Battlefield Studios also acknowledged that earning XP in Escalation and King of the Hill isn't always working and the team is looking into that issue. The devs went on to share a number of updates and adjustments that are currently being considered:</p><ul><li><strong>Class Assignment - Assault 1</strong>: Get kills while using the Adrenaline Injector - 30 to 3</li><li><strong>Class Assignment - Engineer Expert 3</strong>: Repair Vehicles in a Match - From 6000 to 1000</li><li><strong>Weapon Assignment - Deadeye 2</strong>: Get headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles - from 150 to 5</li></ul><p>A later update will reduce the 200m distance. Player complaints about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/" data-ref-id="1100-6535525">the blinding light in Battlefield 6</a> are being considered for fixes that will reduce the effect when looking outdoors. That issue and other visibility problems are in line for wider fixes later in Season 1's life cycle.</p><p>Season 1 Update 1 is going to arrive on October 28, which will include changes to the game's weapon dispersion. This is meant to ensure that every weapon is accurate within its intended performance range. The team also fixed bugs that negatively affected dispersion when coming out of movement.</p><p>Battlefield Studios went on to explain its rationale behind closing the XP farm servers in Server Browser and Community Experiences. The team believed they were detracting from the rest of the Portal experiences, but promised to keep adding updates "to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal.".</p><p>The following updates were made today:</p><ul><li>Verified Experiences with “Bot Backfill” disabled continue to grant Full Progression and XP.</li><li>Custom Experiences will continue earning reduced progression, regardless of whether bots are active. This keeps creative freedom and allows you to express yourself within Portal while maintaining progression balance.</li></ul><p>Finally, Battlefield Studios noted that Battlefield Labs is going on hiatus as it focuses on releasing Season 1. Battlefield Labs will return at some point in the future, and the studio added that "it was invaluable in how much it helped us prepare for the launch of Battlefield 6."</p><p>So far, Battlefield 6 has been massive financial success, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/" data-ref-id="1100-6535488">more than 7 million copies sold</a>. The game recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/">hit a peak concurrent-player record</a> of more than 747,000 players.</p>

                <p>Xbox boss Phil Spencer got pretty candid at the Paley International Council Summit in California, saying that protecting creativity is important to the gaming giant but that it hasn't been the best at doing that as of late.</p><p>During the moderated discussion with Double Fine head Tim Schafer (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-nurturing-and-protecting-creative-teams-that-want-to-go-take-risks-is-the-priority-admits-we-dont-always-succeed-at-that/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Spencer expressed how valuable it is for not just game companies but the media industry writ large to shield the creative teams that pour their hearts and souls into the work they produce.</p>

<p>"The creativity of the teams is, in my mind, the most important thing and the thing that we need to protect and foster," Spencer said.</p><p>Not long after saying this, Spencer noted that Xbox hasn't always safeguarded the creative talent behind its biggest and best games. The sentiment was expressed in the context of internet criticism, but Spencer still admitted that Xbox--and maybe the whole media industry--doesn't protect its workers when it should.</p><p>"I think it's the most brave thing a team can do, whether you're making a movie or a television show, to go and put something out for the internet to evaluate, judge and comment on," Spencer said. "Sometimes I scratch my head on why anybody wants to go do that, because the internet's not always a nice place for the discourse around things that have been created, but nurturing and protecting creative teams that want to go take risks. We don't always succeed at that, but I think it is kind of the root of any media industry, the creative nugget."</p><p>This is true if you look at the recent evidence. In January 2024, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">Microsoft eliminated about 1,900 jobs</a> following the Activision Blizzard acquisition. Over a year later, in May 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-7000-people-in-latest-round-of-massive-cuts/1100-6531500/" data-ref-id="1100-6531500">the company laid off roughly 7,000 people</a> in response to the "dynamic marketplace." And in July 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/" data-ref-id="1100-6532905">Xbox cut some 9,000 people</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceling a slew of games and closing an assortment of studios</a>. Despite these slashes to its workforce, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">the company still reached a $4 trillion valuation</a> at the end of July. An October 2025 Bloomberg report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">the mountainous profit goals Microsoft has for itself are doing far more harm than good</a>, and I suppose that makes sense when you cut nearly 18,000 of your workers within the year.</p><p>Still, Schafer explained that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2019-xbox-game-studios-acquires-psychonauts-2-d/1100-6467547/" data-ref-id="1100-6467547">after Xbox bought Double Fine in 2019</a>, the California studio has maintained its creative independence because of that Xbox money.</p><p>"When we talked about becoming acquired, it was a big thing for me, like, 'How do we keep our culture intact?'" Schafer said. "And everyone was like, 'No, we really want you to stay who you are.' And that's been true all these years … You know, creatively, we can be like, 'Hey, we want to make this game about a walking lighthouse,' and [Xbox is] like, 'Cool. Sounds cool.'"</p><p>That game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/keeper/" data-ref-id="5000-681590">Keeper</a>, is doing pretty well critically for both Double Fine and Xbox. We awarded it a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/keeper-review-this-ones-a-keeper/1900-6418424/" data-ref-id="1900-6418424">our Keeper review</a>, with critic Steve Watts calling it "a visual feast, a tone poem, an exploration of movement mechanics, [and] a fable about the world and what we owe to it."</p>
