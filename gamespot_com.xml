The milestone comes just a bit over three months since the RPG arrived on April 22.

Developer Virtuos was actually behind the new version of the game, which originally launched in 2006 on PC and Xbox 360.

                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty Season 5 arrives to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> next month, and Activision has confirmed the season will launch with the final map for Zombies. Treyarch has since released a series of teaser clips, showing what players can expect for this major story conclusion. This includes the map's Pack-a-Punch location and possible new enemy type with the "Mechaklaus."</p><p dir="ltr">Following the events of Season 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/" data-ref-id="2900-6418">Shattered Veil</a>, the setting of the final map takes place in Janus Towers. Three short teaser clips have been released so far, and they all feature the perspective of Janus Tower security cameras with the grainy look of a '90s-style found footage film.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948058077296722249" rel="nofollow ">first Zombies teaser</a> shows Janus Towers in chaos with fires inside the building and a glimpse of the undead. The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948378886670356717" rel="nofollow ">second teaser</a> seemingly reveals that one of the towers was being used to manufacture robots. It also gives a first look at the map's Pack-a-Pack machine, which is located by a large circular device that could be some sort of teleporter. Janus Towers is a set of three large towers in Liberty Falls, so the teleporter could be a way for players to navigate the separate locations.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1948741274833461339" rel="nofollow ">latest Zombies teaser</a> is even more intriguing, as it gives us the first look at what could be the map's elite enemy type or some other sort of miniboss threat. This likely foe is a bulky mech suit similar to the Panzers from previous Call of Duty Zombies games. This mech suit is already being dubbed the "Mechaklaus," as this was an enemy type previously leaked in the game files. The character inside the suit also looks and sounds like Klaus from Black Ops Cold War.</p><p dir="ltr">Klaus was a robot ally featured on the Mauer der Toten Zombies map, where he helped the main characters save the day and eventually sacrificed himself by walking into the Dark Aether. It's possible Treyarch is teasing that Klaus has returned from the Dark Aether with a mech-suit upgrade, or it could be a completely different Klaus manufactured by Richtofen in Janus Towers.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely get a full trailer and learn more details in the coming days, as Season 5 should launch on or around August 7. Here we highlight all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-5-release-date-and-details/1100-6533306/" data-ref-id="1100-6533306">rumors and announcements for Call of Duty Season 5</a> so far.</p>

As for the physical editions, they will come in two different versions. One, the Icebreaker Edition, includes the game, a digital novella, digital artbook, and a pop-up diorama of the game's New London. A pricier Whiteout Edition includes all of the goodies from the Icebreaker version but also includes access to three of Frostpunk 2's upcoming DLC releases as well as more physical goodies in the form of a keychain, New London postcards, stickers, and a faction patch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffDlQ5RsF4s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ffDlQ5RsF4s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In a press release, 11 bit studios production coordinator Igor Skibinski said the goal with the console version of the post-apocalyptic strategy game was to make its controls seamless. After the console version's release, an update will come to the PC version that will enable the console version's UI when using a controller.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex strategy games can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles," Skibinski said.</p><p dir="ltr">When Frostpunk 2 does arrive on consoles (it first released on PC in September 2024), it will join the console version of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/frostpunk/" data-ref-id="5000-457521">Frostpunk</a>, which is also playable on Game Pass. The survival-focused city-building franchise revolves around making hard choices to ensure civilization's survival amidst an endless winter, with players needing to manage not only essentials to survival like food and heat but also contend with social upheaval.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538412" data-ratio="0.56234567901235" data-width="1620" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4538412"></a><figcaption>Everything included in the new physical Whiteout Edition of Frostpunk 2 for consoles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4538412-frostpunk2whiteoutedittion.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">11 bit studios announced earlier this year it would be remaking the original Frostpunk in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/frostpunk-is-getting-an-unreal-engine-5-remake-with-new-content-and-mod-support/1100-6531113/" data-ref-id="1100-6531113">Unreal Engine 5 under the new name Frostpunk 1886</a>, its name a reference to a pivotal year in the game's lore. The game won't just be a visual update, but will add new content, mechanics, and laws, while also allowing for official mod support, something not possible due to limitations with the original game's engine.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Frostpunk 2, 11 bit studios made clear it will continue to support it with new updates and content, and that development on Frostpunk 2 and Frostpunk 1886 will "evolve side by side." According to a Frostpunk 2 roadmap, the game will receive multiple free major content updates and paid DLCs, a few of which will arrive in 2025 with more to come in 2026.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Game Pass news, Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-these-8-games-in-july/2900-5561/" data-ref-id="2900-5561">adding eight games to Game Pass soon</a>, while it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-losing-these-three-games-pretty-soon/2900-6767/" data-ref-id="2900-6767">remove three games</a>, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" data-ref-id="5000-590945">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, on July 31.</p>

                <p>Crytek was founded in 1999 by three Turkish-German brothers, Cevat, Avni, and Faruk Yerli. The brothers have come together to bring a limited-series documentary about everything Crytek, with the first part <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk&amp;t" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already online</a>. For the first time, fans will be able to see previously unseen footage, explore early concept art, and delve deeper into the stories that made the studio what it was.</p><p>The documentary starts with the story of the brothers getting a black box PC from their father, which they said was for "studying," but they knew what they wanted to do with their lives. They also knew what they didn't want.</p><p>"We cannot be a typical German game company, because German game companies, usually used to, back then, make strategy games, RPG games very complicated to play," said Avni. "So our idea was to offer an experience, which is open-world sandbox experiences, semi-sandbox experiences, where you can also see the environment, walk around, experience everything. And that was completely new."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxnHi6SltHk" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HxnHi6SltHk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Initially based in Coburg, Germany, the studio aimed to push the boundaries of real-time 3D graphics in video games. Their early tech demos, such as X-Isle, caught the attention of Nvidia and led to a publishing deal with Ubisoft for their first major game, Far Cry, released in 2004.</p><p>The first part mostly covers the development of Crysis and how they wanted to take what they learned from Far Cry and expand on that, pushing the limits on graphics at the time.</p><p>"In Far Cry, the art department created a natural environment as they have imagined it. Like they built the jungle out of their head, so to say. And in Crysis, we mimicked nature as closely as possible. I think that made a massive difference. Even though in some areas, the technology wasn't so different," said Crysis 3D artist, Marcel Schaika.</p><p>"The way we built the environment, the way we used the technology, like really specifically trying to mimic, how nature behaves, how leaves look like when the sun shines through them how the ocean looks like, how the water refracts, and so on," Schaika continued. "The artists working together with the engineers to really try to create a virtual environment that looks just like the references that we have gathered. I think that mindset made Crysis stand out so much in comparison as well."</p><p>Part one is only 20 minutes long, and it's unclear how many parts of the documentary will be released.</p><p>In other Crytek news, the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/crytek-announces-significant-layoffs-as-crysis-4-is-put-on-hold/1100-6529419/" data-ref-id="1100-6529419">underwent layoffs</a> earlier this year, resulting in a new Crysis sequel being put on hold.</p>
