There are a few objectives that follow the initial one, though, so we've put together a guide to help you wrap it all up and get back home safely.</p><p>You don't necessarily need to extract to complete this quest, so no need to worry about bringing in your best gear or a safe pocket.

                <p>More than a decade after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> will finally get cross-play, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios has confirmed it's actively working on the feature. However, it might still "be a while" until the feature is ready.</p><p dir="ltr">While cross-play has long been something ZeniMax Online has said it wants to do and has explored options for, this is the first time the developer has confirmed it's actually happening, though there is not yet a clear idea of when, exactly, the feature will arrive.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while," ESO executive Susan Kath said as part of a virtual Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot ahead of the game's 2026 preview livestream. "Just to set the stage on that. We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it might still be a bit of a wait, Kath said players could potentially see some tests related to the feature by the end of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">The news came as part of recent livestream previewing the year ahead for the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG, which is moving to a seasonal content release model in 2026 in contrast to the yearly chapter (expansion) releases that have defined the game for most of its life.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players can only play with other players on their respective platforms, with separate servers for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation players. ZeniMax Online has previously outlined the technical problems that have prevented cross-play up to this point, including issues stemming from the game being built without cross-play in mind, concerns surrounding each server's separate economies, problems around performance, and the fact that PC players can play with game-modifying add-ons that console players can't.</p><p dir="ltr">Cross-play was just one of the big announcements ZeniMax Online shared for its long-running MMO, as it also detailed what else players can expect in the months and year to come.</p><p dir="ltr">After a transitional 2025 that also saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">ZeniMax Online team hit by Microsoft layoffs</a> and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">unannounced MMO project Blackbird canceled</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">2026 is the year ESO is going-all-in on seasons</a>, complete with the introduction of a battle pass system called Tamriel Tomes. The year will also see the introduction of several class reworks, new experimental zones and activities, the introduction of solo dungeons, and the addition of previously paid DLC content like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild into the base game for free</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/" data-ref-id="5000-140736">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is continuing to expand, as previously paid DLC content for the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and more will soon become part of the base game for free.</p><p dir="ltr">In March with the game's Update 49, the Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Imperial City, and Orsinium DLC will be folded into the base game and become accessible for all players. Closer to the end of the year, the Greymoor chapter will also become part of the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, ESO players need to subscribe to the game's optional ESO Plus membership (around $15 a month) or purchase each DLC separately using the game's premium currency, Crowns, in order to access the content outlined above.</p><p dir="ltr">Orsinium, released in 2015, added the homeland of the orcs and new dungeons for players to explore at the cost of 3,000 Crowns, or around $25. The Imperial City DLC, released in 2015 for 2,500 Crowns (roughly $20), saw players return to one of Oblivion's most iconic locations in an effort to stop Molag Bal's daedric forces from abusing the seat of power at the center of Tamriel.  Both the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild DLC released in 2016 for 2,000 Crowns each, translating to about $20 per DLC.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Dark Brotherhood DLC, players are able to join the shadowy organization of assassins and gain access to a new Assassin passive skill line that more easily allows for the murder of NPCs. Those who join the Thieves Guild gain access to sneaking-and-stealing-focused passive skills, allowing players to make more money from stolen goods and access special treasure troves hidden across Tamriel.</p><p dir="ltr">Greymoor, meanwhile, will be the biggest addition of the bunch when it becomes free sometime in the winter of 2026. The chapter originally released in 2020 and introduced the western regions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-skyrim/2900-5554/" data-ref-id="2900-5554">Skyrim</a>, where players can embark on a quest to stop an ancient vampire lord.</p><p dir="ltr">The news of previously premium DLC becoming free came as part of a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-elder-scrolls-online-is-going-all-in-on-seasons-in-2026/1100-6537219/" data-ref-id="1100-6537219">ESO 2026 roadmap</a> livestream. During the presentation, developer ZeniMax Online Studios outlined its plans for its MMORPG in the year ahead--one that includes a new seasonal focus, the addition of a battle pass, and class reworks. ESO's move to a seasonal model comes after a transitional 2025 that didn't see the release of a new chapter. Instead, 2025 saw the release of one experimental season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/" data-ref-id="1100-6528526">Seasons of the Worm Cult</a>, that played out over the course of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to free DLC, ZeniMax Online also confirmed it's working to finally bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-is-finally-getting-cross-play-but-it-might-still-be-a-while/1100-6537192/" data-ref-id="1100-6537192">cross-play to ESO</a> in the future, though it sounds like it could still be a while before players on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation are able to play together.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online/">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> in 2026 will look quite different from previous years, as developer ZeniMax Online Studios goes all-in on the game's new seasonal model that will see all of the game's content updates arrive free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">For years, ESO has followed a familiar, fairly typical MMO pattern of yearly paid chapter (expansion) releases. Those new chapters added new regions of Tamriel for players to explore, additional story content, optional paid DLCs, and, occasionally, things like new classes and systems.</p><p dir="ltr">ZeniMax Online announced in 2024 that going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-is-ditching-chapters-in-favor-of-more-frequent-bite-sized-updates/1100-6528526/">ESO wouldn't have a traditional yearly chapter release</a>, labeling 2025 as a "transitional" year as the team prepared to focus on its plans for 2026. In a recent livestream and subsequent press Q&amp;A attended by GameSpot, the developers have now revealed what ESO's 2026 will look like, and it includes more experimental seasonal content, battle passes, new story content, solo dungeons, a PvP progression system, class reworks, and more.The team also announced its long-term goals for the game, including that it's looking to finally introduce cross-play between platforms, as well as long-requested features such as guild mail and guild housing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631357"></a><figcaption>ESO's 2026 roadmap, which ZeniMax Online Studios stresses is still subject to change.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4631357-eso_seasons-roadmap_infographic.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Game director Nick Giacomini said ZeniMax Online has heard from players that ESO's longrunning chapter-based structure had become "too formulaic," and jsaid it was also limiting from a development standpoint. Its move to a more seasonal model is in the name of being able to more quickly bring fresh ideas and gameplay to the nearly 12-year-old MMORPG.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something players have been asking us to do for a really long time--to pause and work on addressing pain points, and build the future of ESO together," Giacomini said. "This is the beginning of a major shift, just like One Tamriel was a decade ago, where we are going to be making major changes, just in a completely different way."</p><p dir="ltr">Each season will be completely different, Giacomini said, all the while giving the team the flexibility to improve and iterate on parts of the core game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Goodbye Chapters, Hello Seasons</h2><p dir="ltr">As part of the seasonal model, all future content updates will be free, a major change from most of ESO's existence when players needed to buy new chapters or various DLC packs to experience most of the game's new content. Should future seasons add new zones, additional storylines, or new systems, all those additions will come to players free of charge. There will be four seasons a year, with each season lasting three months.</p><p dir="ltr">"In general, the things that were rolled out as chapters, those will just be game updates from now on," executive producer Susan Kath said.</p><p dir="ltr">ESO's transformation will begin with Update 49 in March, when it will bake the game's premium <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-onlines-dark-brotherhood-and-thieves-guild-dlc-will-soon-be-free/1100-6537209/" data-ref-id="1100-6537209">Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Imperial City and Orsinium DLCs into the base game</a>. That update will also mark the first time ZeniMax Online will release an ESO update simultaneously across PC, Xbox, and PlayStation, the new normal going forward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630772"></a><figcaption>Season 0 will bring big changes to the Dragonknight class.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630772-esoseasons2026lavawhip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Next, in April, ESO's first proper season will kick off. Titled Season 0, it will bring with it a major class update for Dragonknight that will see its skills and visuals reworked, as well as updates to the two-handed weapons skill line. Season 0 will also add a new experimental event zone called The Night Market.</p><p dir="ltr">This new zone is designed to be much harder than typical overworld combat in ESO (something the team is also looking to address later this year with a new Overland difficulty setting). It's a group-focused PvE zone where players are encouraged to group up and push farther and farther into the zone. Players will choose one of three factions to represent, earning rewards along the way. Those rewards will include a new upgradable house (the first to include a bank), as well as a new gameplay-effecting reward type ZeniMax Online is keeping quiet about for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the Night Market is billed as a limited-time event, it will return later in 2026 after its initial run. Should it prove popular, ZeniMax Online said it could potentially become a permanent feature.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Tamriel Tomes</h2><p dir="ltr">The release of Season 0 will also see the launch of the game's new battle pass system, called Tamriel Tomes. This system will replace the game's existing daily challenges and login rewards. Instead, there will be weekly and seasonal challenges (with the ability to re-roll unwanted weeklies) that will progress the battle pass as players complete them.</p><p dir="ltr">As players progress the tome, they'll be able to unlock free cosmetic rewards ranging from armor appearances to new skill styles, as well as currencies like Seals of Endeavor. In typical battle pass fashion, there will be a free version as well as $15 and $30 premium versions that come with additional cosmetics. Premium versions of the battle pass won't expire, allowing players to continue progressing them after the end of a season.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with Tamriel Tomes is the new Gold Coast Bazaar, a system that sounds similar to World of Warcraft's Trading Post. The bazaar will sell various cosmetics and former limited-time rewards, as well as some new ones. Items will rotate in and out but will be available for long durations, like the entirety of a season, Giacomini said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773" data-ratio="0.56246648793566" data-width="1865" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630773"></a><figcaption>The Night Market will offer far greater challenges than ESO's typical content.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630773-esoseasons2026thenightmarket.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Items in the bazaar can be bought with a new currency, Trade Bars, earned primarily through Tamriel Tomes but also in small amounts in-game. While most of the available Trade Bars will be found in the free version of each seasonal battle pass, the paid versions of Tamriel Tomes will additionally include a small amount of the currency. But you won't be able to purchase Trade Bars directly with Crowns, ESO's premium currency.</p><p dir="ltr">"Over the years, we've introduced so many limited-time cosmetics...and if you missed them, it was either impossible to get them again, or we would re-introduce them unpredictably or inconsistently," Giacomini said. "The bazaar provides a consistent and reliable place for players to finally be able to claim these rewards."</p><p dir="ltr">The introduction of Tamriel Tomes and the Gold Coast Bazaar will bring some changes to ESO's optional subscription, ESO Plus. Its price won't change and no benefits are being removed, but additional benefits will be added, such as subscribers earning battle pass progress at an accelerated rate. Every month a player is subscribed to ESO Plus, they'll also earn credit towards a free premium Tamriel Tome upgrade that can be bought once 12 credits have been earned. These credits don't have to be earned consecutively, meaning players can subscribe to ESO off and on and still accumulate credits to eventually be used for a premium Tamriel Tome.</p><h2 dir="ltr">ESO's 2026 Roadmap</h2><p dir="ltr">As for future seasons, ZeniMax Online made clear it is treating its 2026 roadmap as a living document that may change or shift over the course of the year, but it does have plans for what later seasons will include. Season 1, slated for late summer, will introduce new Thieves Guild content, multi-stage world events, a new trial, and new story content centered around the fan-favorite daedric prince Sheoggorath. The season will also bring class updates to the Warden.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is slated for the winter, and will include Sorcerer class updates, the introduction of solo dungeons (a single-player version of the game's existing group dungeons), large-scale world events in Skyrim, and a still-shrouded-in-secrecy High Seas of Tamriel event that will involve naval combat. It will additionally add the game's Greymoor chapter into the base game.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the biggest requests ESO players have had over the years is cross-play. In the past, the studio has outlined the difficulties posed by linking its players across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, but it sounds like, at long last, it's doing the work to make that dream a reality. The only downside is that it sounds like cross-play might not be coming anytime soon.</p><p dir="ltr">"Cross-play is definitely coming, but it's going to be a while, just to set the stage on that." Kath said. "We are working on it. It is a complex problem for a game like ESO--it was not ever built with this in mind. There are a lot of considerations we have to make."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4630780"></a><figcaption>Updates in 2026 will bring faster riding skill training and higher furnishing limits for some homes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4630780-eso2026seasonsfurnishings.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While cross-play may take some time to arrive, there are other quality-of-life changes coming sooner. Some of the changes coming ahead of Season 0 include account-wide outfit slots, the ability to respecc skills and attributes for free from the game's user interface, and equal experience points for the skills on players' back action bar. Other improvements coming include faster riding training, with the ability to raise the skill by three points at a time instead of one, and the power to upgrade backs from the UI rather than having to travel to a vendor. Higher furnishing limits are coming to some houses as well.</p><p dir="ltr">That's far from an exhaustive list, and even more "player experience improvements" are slated for later in the year, according to ZeniMax Online's roadmap. Judging from the whole roadmap, each season looks wildly different from the last. That's by design, as Kath said the goal is for there to not be a "typical season" blueprint the studio is following. It's a sentinment Giacomini echoed.</p><p dir="ltr">"The key difference is variety and choice," Giacomini said. "We want to be building what's important to you, the players, and we believe this new model is the best way to do so."</p><p dir="ltr">More details regarding launch dates for ESO's Season 0, and new content like the Night Market, will be revealed in the coming months. ZeniMax Online studio director Rich Lambert said last year he wants ESO to be a "30-year MMO. However, he said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-online-studio-wants-to-make-other-games/1100-6534748/" data-ref-id="1100-6534748">studio does still want to make other games</a>, despite Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">canceling an unannounced new MMO</a> from the studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-elder-scrolls-online-teams-reportedly-canceled-mmo/1100-6533760/" data-ref-id="1100-6533760">codenamed Blackbird</a>.</p>
