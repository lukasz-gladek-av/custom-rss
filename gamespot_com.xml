Here's the full list of enhancements for each one:</p><h2>Dino Crisis</h2><ul><li>Full Windows 10 and Windows 11 compatibility</li><li>English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, and Japanese language localizations</li><li>Original, Arrange, and Operation Wipe Out modes included</li><li>Improved DirectX game-renderer</li><li>New rendering options--Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more</li><li>Increased rendering resolution to approximately 4K (1920p) and color depth to 32-bit</li><li>Improved geometry calculation with more stable transformation and texturing</li><li>Enhanced alpha transparency</li><li>Improved game registry settings</li><li>Smooth animation, video, and music playback without issues</li><li>Reliable saving system (the game no longer corrupts save files after leaving dropped weapons)</li><li>Full support for modern controllers</li><li>Validated stability</li><li>Cloud saves support</li></ul><h2>Dino Crisis 2</h2><ul><li>Full Windows 10 and Windows 11 compatibility</li><li>English and Japanese language localizations</li><li>Easy difficulty, Dino Colosseum, and Dino Duel included</li><li>Improved DirectX game-renderer</li><li>New rendering options--Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more</li><li>Improved music playback and volume scaling</li><li>Enhanced item-rendering and fogging</li><li>Improved cartridge boxes alignment</li><li>Smooth video playback, task-switching, and game exit</li><li>Full support for modern controllers with optimal button-mapping for both wired and wireless modes</li><li>Validated stability</li><li>Cloud saves support</li></ul><p>The first Dino Crisis game was released in 1999 for the PlayStation, and with Shinji Mikami as game director, there was quite a bit of Resident Evil DNA in its design. The franchise expanded with two sequels and a lightgun spin-off, but since then, it has been in hibernation.</p><p>The good news is that a spiritual successor called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-dino-crisis-like-game-is-ps5-exclusive-because-youre-all-sickos/1100-6528895/">Code Violet is in development as a PS5 exclusive</a>, but don't expect it to come to PC. Developers at TeamKill Media say this is because they want to stop modders from being able to use the game and its assets to create sexually themed mods, as part of its efforts to protect the game and the voice talent who worked on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/" rel="nofollow ">GOG has also announced Dreamlist</a>, a tool that'll let people vote on games they want to see brought over to GOG and given a similar enhancement treatment as Dino Crisis. This system will allow the owners of those IP to see how much interest there is in a game, and currently, Freelancer is sitting at the top of that wishlist, beating other games like Resident Evil: Code Veronica X, Final Fantasy 7, and No One Lives Forever.</p>
