                <p>Last year, Polished Games' top-down 2D survival roguelite Be My Horde introduced players to Moriana, a necromancer--or necromancess, if you prefer--who can make the dead serve as her army. She's the villain of her own story, so it shouldn't be too surprising that Moriana is heading to Hell in the game's newest update. If anything, that's bad news for demons, because Moriana might be taking over Hell one circle at a time.</p><p>The name of update is "Welcome to Hell," and it adds the Hell level, which may be Moriana's biggest challenge to date. As seen in the newly released trailer below, Moriana's travels through Hell will bring her face-to-face with the Devil himself. That video also offers a more in-depth look at what awaits in Hell. Moriana and her undead minions will have to battle new enemies and survive the severe hazards of the underworld. Fire tornadoes, lava ponds, and explosive volcanoes all stand between Moriana and her destiny.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Be My Horde : Welcome To Hell Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As you may have noticed, Moriana's powers thrive on death, and she can turn every fallen enemy into one of her new warriors. There's no entrance test for this army. If Moriana can kill it, it's her's to command, even if it's just an exploding sheep. However, Moriana is not invincible and she can be defeated in battle. But she always returns with a vengeance.</p><p>"Welcome to Hell" is also adding some tools to Moriana's magical arsenal, including a new skill tree mechanic to enhance the minions and fresh attacks like Frost Nova, Frost Bolt, and Blizzard. Those are all very useful powers in Hell and beyond.</p><p>Be My Horde is still in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2499520/Be_My_Horde/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but the game is getting a temporary 20% discount that coincides with the arrival of "Welcome to Hell," which is out today.</p>
