                <p>In real life, a skateboard is generally a quick way to get around town, but in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate/">Skate</a>, you can leave your fellow skaters in the dust by rag-dolling to your destination. With the game now out in early access on PC and console, players have begun to discover several physics-defying glitches--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-glitch-lets-you-cheat-gravity-by-clapping/1100-6534797/">like clapping being better than a parachute</a>. On social media channels, you can find numerous examples of players flopping around, building up some impressive speed with their asphalt nipple-surfing around the city of San Vansterdamn.</p><p>In related news, <a href="https://x.com/SkateStatus/status/1968048173492081010" rel="nofollow ">developer Full Circle has confirmed</a> that it is looking to address the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-server-queues-lead-to-complaints-about-always-online-requirement/1100-6534790/">lengthy waiting times</a> to hop into the game. "Our team is hard at work adding more servers and getting more skaters into San Van," the studio said. Earlier this week, Full Circle said there are "a LOT" of players attempting to jump into Skate, leading to the congested server issues. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-new-skate-game-is-always-online-reconfirmed-for-2025-launch/1100-6531121/">Since the game is designed to be always online</a>, eager players currently have no choice but to wait until space frees up, leading many players to request an offline mode be added to Skate.</p><p>The launch week of Skate has gotten off to a strong start--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" rel="nofollow ">with a peak concurrent players figure of 81,340 users</a> on Steam so far--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-season-1-start-and-end-dates-what-you-can-expect/1100-6534794/">and the game's first season</a> kicks off in October.

This year will be no different, but the drop will feature a unique twist: Play-Doh.</p><p dir="ltr">The drop, called Secret Lair x Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking, features reprinted cards sporting artwork taken from real-life Play-Doh sculptures. The four cards included in the Secret Lair x Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking drop are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Greensleeves, Maro-Sorcerer</li><li dir="ltr">Polyraptor</li><li dir="ltr">Academy Manufactor</li><li dir="ltr">Wurmcoil Engine</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This marks the seventh straight year Wizards of the Coast has released a Secret Lair drop benefitting Extra Life. Previous Extra Life drops from Secret Lair include cards with art hand-drawn by patients from Seattle Children’s Autism Center in 2021 and 2022, two separate My Little Pony-themed drops in 2019 and 2023, and last year's drop featuring pixel art from longtime MTG artist Mike Burns.</p><p dir="ltr">Magic: The Gathering Secret Lair x Play-Doh: Squishful Thinking will be available on the Secret Lair website September 29 to November 9, both in non-foil for $40 and in rainbow foil for $50. The drop will also be available in limited quantities at MagicCon: Atlanta September 26-28.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the only drop coming to Secret Lair soon, as a new superdrop themed around the Marvel's Spider-Man set will begin on September 22. The superdrop features six drops of five cards each, and they will feature reprinted cards from MTG history with art highlighting Spider-Man and some of his most fearsome archenemies.</p>

                <p>Microsoft recently cut thousands of jobs as part of its latest round of mass layoffs, and as part of the drawback, the company also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">canceled the new Perfect Dark and closed its developer, The Initiative.</a></p><p>The studio's top boss, Darrell Gallagher, has now written a eulogy of sorts for Perfect Dark and The Initiative, while also confirming his own departure from Microsoft.</p><p>"After an incredible journey, my time at Xbox has come to a close with the wind-down of Perfect Dark and The Initiative. I couldn't be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead," Gallagher said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7373350179040714752/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. "Together, we set out to reimagine an iconic franchise and poured creativity, craft, and dedication into every step of the way. The public reception and excitement for what we were building has been inspiring and deeply appreciated by all of us."</p><p>Gallagher said the "spirit, talent, and achievements" of the developers will live on "well beyond the project."</p><p>"I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what's next--both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with. Here's to new adventures and to celebrating the journey we've shared," Gallagher said.</p><p>Gallagher has worked in the video game industry for decades, having spent time at Rockstar Games as a lead artist, then at THQ as studio art director. He later joined Crystal Dynamics and was the art director and later head of studio before being promoted to become head of product development and studios at Square Enix. He joined Activision in 2016 and was a senior vice president and head of development for various Call of Duty games. In 2018, he joined Xbox to establish The Initiative and kick off work on the reimagining of Perfect Dark.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite co-developer Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development. GTA parent company Take-Two apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-almost-got-a-second-chance-at-take-two-report/1100-6534419/" data-ref-id="1100-6534419">almost stepped in to save Perfect Dark</a>, but a deal didn't come together in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by the latest wave of layoffs at Microsoft. The Initiative was the only studio that was closed, but other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software also saw layoffs</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a> was also canceled.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 boss Randy Pitchford is encouraging people to request refunds if they aren't enjoying the newly launched game, and now one publisher known for being cheeky has weighed in and offered up an alternative.</p><p>Devolver Digital said anyone who gets a refund for Borderlands 4 can spend that money on one of its games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3247750/Mycopunk/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mycopunk</a>, which launched in July and costs $15. The game bears some stylistic resemblances to Borderlands 4, and, like that game, is also a co-op shooter set on an alien planet.</p><p>You can buy Mycopunk from GameSpot sister site Fanatical.</p><p>Devolver is known for capitalizing on wider games industry talking points to promote its own games. For example, the publisher has maintained that it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-re-commits-to-releasing-a-game-on-the-same-day-as-gta-6-after-delay/1100-6531291/" data-ref-id="1100-6531291">intentionally launch a game the same day as GTA 6</a>, something the company re-committed to after GTA 6 was delayed to May 2026.</p><p>For anyone just catching up, Pitchford has been posting non-stop since Borderlands 4 launched on September 12.

                <p dir="ltr">During last week's Nintendo Direct, Square Enix surprised Dragon Quest fans with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-7-remake-announced-after-months-of-speculation/1100-6534696/">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a>, a remake of the classic PlayStation RPG from the year 2000. It seems Square Enix was not done with the surprise Dragon Quest reveals, as today the company announced Dragon Quest Smash/Grow, a roguelite RPG for mobile devices that will enter a closed beta test next month.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow tasks players with fighting hordes of enemies at once, "smashing" through their ranks in order to "grow" their characters with experience and loot. Once powerful enough, players can then unleash powerful Coup de Grace attacks in order to finish the enemy armies off.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3mPefOfho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6U3mPefOfho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The roguelite mechanic in Dragon Quest Smash/Grow is called Blessings, which are chosen from randomly generated options throughout the course of a run. Each run will depend on the Blessings made available to a player throughout the adventure; as is typical with roguelite games, no two runs will feel exactly alike.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Quest Smash/Grow will be available for both iOS and Android devices. A closed beta test for Dragon Quest Smash/Grow has been announced for October 14-21. Players can pre-regiser for the beta test on iOS using TestFlight, Android via the Google Play Store, and at the <a href="https://smashgrow.dragonquest.com/en/cbt" rel="nofollow ">game's official website</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has been busy with reveals over the past few months across many of its RPG franchises. Along with Dragon Quest VII Reimagined and Smash/Grow, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade was confirmed for a January 22 release on Nintendo Switch 2, while Octopath Traveler 0 and The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales were both announced over the summer.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>If you've played any PC or console games over the last 12 months, there's a good chance that at least one of them was a remake or a remaster. That's according to new research, which found that not only have these games been popular with the people they polled for this research, they've also been "desirable" diversions.</p><p>Specialist strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) polled 1,500 people--750 people each in the US and the UK--who play games regularly. "Our report shows that there is a strong appeal for remakes and remasters, but it's a tight balancing act for studios to get right," said Martin Bradley, head of gaming at MTM. "Many of these games are far out-selling their original release."</p>

<p>MTM also revealed that 85% of the people who played a remaster or remake in the last year had not even played the original version of the game, so this wasn't entirely a case of nostalgia guiding their choices. That being said, MTM added that nostalgia is still a powerful influence, even when gamers understand that they might be missing out on fresher and novel gameplay experiences by choosing reimagined games over newer titles.</p><p>It hasn't been difficult to find a remastered game either, as publishers have focused their efforts on reviving classic games in addition to new projects. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review/1900-6418359/">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">one of the best-selling games of the year so far</a>--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review-youre-pretty-good/1900-6418396/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the House of the Dead 2: Remake were all released this year, and looking ahead, remakes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-remake-sounds-like-its-still-a-long-ways-away/1100-6532621/">Persona 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">Splinter Cell</a> are also on the way.</p><p>Nintendo has also been keenly aware of the value of its older games for years now, and while it has produced several remakes and remasters, it's even going a step further this year by remaking its flop Virtual Boy console--sort of.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/">Virtual Boy functionality is coming</a> February 17, 2026, to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, and to play these games, you'll need a new accessory modeled after the original console that you can slot your Switch or Switch 2 device into.</p>
