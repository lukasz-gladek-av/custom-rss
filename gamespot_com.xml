But it's surely a disappointing development for many.</p><p>The game is now set for release on May 26, 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. It was previously set for release in Fall 2025.</p><p>"We are very sorry that this is later than you expected. The interest and excitement surrounding a new Grand Theft Auto has been truly humbling for our entire team. We want to thank you for your support and your patience as we work to finish the game," Rockstar said.</p><p>The statement continued: "With every game we have released, the goal has always been to try and exceed your expectations, and Grand Theft Auto VI is no exception. We hope you understand that we need this extra time to deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve."</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two, meanwhile, issued a statement informing investors of the delay and its impact on the company's financial performance.</p><p>"We support fully Rockstar Games taking additional time to realize their creative vision for Grand Theft Auto VI<i>, </i>which promises to bea groundbreaking, blockbuster entertainment experience that exceeds audience expectations," Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said. "While we take the movement of our titles seriously and appreciate the vast and deep global anticipation for Grand Theft Auto VI, we remain steadfast in our commitment to excellence. As we continue to release our phenomenal pipeline, we expect to deliver a multi-year period of growth in our business and enhanced value for our shareholders."</p><p>Take-Two said it continues to expect to reach "sequential increases" and record levels of net bookings for fiscal 2026 and 2027. While GTA 6 is no longer coming this year, Take-Two's labels still have Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4 coming this year, in addition to its roster of sports titles.</p><p>Take-Two will release its next earnings report on May 15.</p><p>The delay for GTA 6 comes amid upheaval in the video game industry, with companies <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">raising prices on consoles and games</a> due in part to Trump's controversial tariff plans and a variety of other market factors.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be a blockbuster success, with one company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">predicting 40 million in sales in the first year alone.</a> The game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corsair-ceo-believes-grand-theft-auto-6-will-hit-pc-in-early-2026/1100-6529520/" data-ref-id="1100-6529520">expected to come to PC at a later date</a>, creating a second selling cycle for the open-world game.</p><p>GTA 6 being delayed into 2026 is tough news for the overall gaming market, too, as one research firm predicted that the video game industry was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">relying on GTA 6 in 2025 to help turn things around.</a></p>
