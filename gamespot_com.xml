Destroying these different types of rocks will give you the chance to obtain various ores and stones. There are a few additional gemstones and ores that can be found by defeating certain enemies as well.</p><p>With well over a dozen different ore for you to find in The Forge with varying locations and rarity types, it can be quite overwhelming.

The point is to take that ore to the titular forge and use it to craft various items. You are able to get weapons and armor by crafting with the ore at these forge locations in Stonewake’s Cross and the Forgotten Kingdom.</p><p>Of course, the rarer the ore, the better chances you’ll get a high-quality or even exclusive item. You can then take the items you have crafted using your ore and sell them or even equip them to have better stats to do better against the various enemies in the world. This is why it is vital that you know where to find specific ore, so you are always improving your gear and gaining even more money.</p><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge beyond the overwhelming number of available ores.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Escape From Duckov - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Battlestate Games controversially required that players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-on-steam-will-require-you-buy-it-again/1100-6534783/" data-ref-id="1100-6534783">re-purchase the game</a> if they wanted to play it on Steam, even if they already purchased it directly from Battlestate. Escape from Tarkov also saw some controversy around its sales strategy when the studio revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-escape-from-tarkov-edition-locks-pve-behind-250-paywall/1100-6522990/" data-ref-id="1100-6522990">$250 pre-order edition</a> that unlocked access to an exclusive PVE mode, and other features that players called out as pay-to-win.</p><p>Battlestate has also shared a <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/370" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">few other stats</a> from Tarkov's first month of full release, alongside its 1 million sales figure. The studio revealed that players have spent a total of 135,000,000 hours, equivalent to 15,410 years playing Escape From Tarkov in the past month.</p><p>It only became possible to finally escape from Tarkov in the 1.0 version of the game, with the first player to accomplish the difficult feat celebrated on the studio's social media pages. Since then, over 500 people have managed to escape, accomplishing one of the game's multiple endings.</p><p>Escape from Tarkov isn't the only extraction shooter celebrating sales milestones recently--parody shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/escape-from-duckov-a-parody-of-tarkov-featuring-ducks-is-putting-up-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535556/" data-ref-id="1100-6535556">Escape from Duckov also reached 1 million sales</a> just five days after its release in mid-October. Embark Studios' new extraction shooter Arc Raiders has also seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-hits-480000-active-players-on-steam-quadruple-cods-launch-weekend-peak/1100-6536262/" data-ref-id="1100-6536262">a lot of success</a> since it released in October, giving Tarkov a run for its money in the genre it originated.</p>

While the studio wants to stay faithful to the original, it has also said it plans to tone down the brutal difficulty of the nearly 30-year-old PlayStation 1 game.</p><p>Speaking in a press conference, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked about adapting the original PS1 game specifically when it comes to difficulty. Like many games of its era, the 1996 game was known to have its punishingly difficult sections, including insta-kill death traps that were often near-impossible to avoid without the benefit of hindsight.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Let's Talk Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis &amp; Tomb Raider Catalyst | The Game Awards 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>"Part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes," Kerslake said, and though he doesn't explicitly mention difficulty it seems safe to say that Legacy of Atlantis will have far fewer insta-kills. That doesn't mean the game will be a walk in the park, however.</p><p>"It is core to the Tomb Raider experience that there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action," Kerslake continued, assuring fans that the classic Tomb Raider DNA will still be present in Legacy of Atlantis. "You'll see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades."</p><p>Legacy of Atlantis is due out in 2026, marking the 30th anniversary of the PS1 title. As the original Tomb Raider is now 30 years old, Crystal Dynamics in collaboration with Flying Wild Hog are approaching the game as more of a "reimagining" than a direct remake.</p><p>Lara Croft will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tomb-raider-games-recast-lara-croft-with-a-gaming-veteran/1100-6536948/" data-ref-id="1100-6536948">voiced by a newcomer</a> to the series, Alix Wilton Regan, who will also play Lara in the brand-new title Tomb Raider: Catalyst. Camilla Luddington, who voiced Lara through the 2013 reboot trilogy, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tomb-raider-actor-shares-her-heartfelt-farewell-to-lara-croft/1100-6536958/" data-ref-id="1100-6536958">posted a heartfelt farewell</a> to the character and wished her successor all the best with the franchise.</p>

                <p>The second annual edition of <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Indie Game Awards</a> is set to honor the realm of gaming beyond the AAA titles that dominate the industry. Unlike <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, the IGAs are an awards-only online ceremony that's dedicated to honoring its nominees rather than splitting the focus with game-reveal trailers. GameSpot is one of the partners for this year's IGAs, and below you can see .</p><h2>Where Can I Watch The Indie Game Awards?</h2><p>You won't have to go far to watch it. GameSpot will be livestreaming The Indie Game Awards on Thursday, December 18, starting with the countdown show at 3:30 PM PT / 6:30 PM ET. You can check it out in the embed below or on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameSpot's YouTube channel</a>.</p><h3>Indie Game Awards Start Time</h3><ul><li>3:30 PM PT</li><li>6:30 PM ET</li><li>11:30 PM GMT</li><li>10:30 AM AET</li></ul><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvNK_iZK6l8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvNK_iZK6l8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>Who Is Hosting The Indie Game Awards?</h2><p>Six One Indie's Mike Towndrow, Kelsey Lynn Towndrow, and Kyle Stephenson will share hosting duties at this year's Indie Game Awards.</p><h2>Who Are the Nominees For The Indie Game Awards in 2025?</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQY7JgJXKmc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gQY7JgJXKmc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's a sign of how well indie games did in 2025 that titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-577618">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> were nominated for top prizes in both The Game Awards and The Indie Game Awards. However, the various categories for each game are designed to spread the love, so to speak. That means a single title isn't likely to dominate the IGAs the way that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 did at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">The Game Awards</a>.</p><h3>Game of the Year</h3><ul><li>Absolum</li><li>and Roger</li><li>Blue Prince</li><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keep Driving</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li></ul><h3>Achievement in Accessibility</h3><ul><li>Abiotic Factor</li><li>Barista</li><li>Calm the Storm</li><li>Peak</li><li>Spray Paint Simulator</li><li>Squeakross: Home Squeak Home</li></ul><h3>African Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Bru &amp; Boegie Get Da Milk!</li><li>Finding Father</li><li>Flibbius McDoogle and The Mysterious Flying Machine</li><li>IKEELYA</li><li>Metavoidal</li><li>Stick It To The Stickman</li></ul><h3>ANZ Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Abiotic Factor</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Mars First Logistics</li><li>PROXIMATE</li><li>Tempopo</li><li>The Drifter</li></ul><h3>Bite-Sized Game</h3><ul><li>CARIMARA - Beneath the Forlorn Limbs</li><li>FlyKnight</li><li>Many Nights a Whisper</li><li>The Dark Queen of Mortholme</li><li>this game will end in 205 clicks.</li><li>Time Flies</li></ul><h3>Black Voices in Gaming Award</h3><ul><li>Advent Neon</li><li>Altheia: The Wrath of Aferi</li><li>Sorry We’re Closed</li><li>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</li><li>Sunken Stones</li><li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</li></ul><h3>Community Management</h3><ul><li>Consume Me</li><li>Date Everything!</li><li>IKEELYA</li><li>PEAK</li><li>Soulstone Survivors</li><li>Strange Scaffold</li></ul><h3>Debut Game</h3><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Discounty</li><li>Fretless - The Wrath of Riffson</li><li>ILA: A Frosty Glide</li><li>Sorry We're Closed</li></ul><h3>Emotional Impact</h3><ul><li>Afterlove EP</li><li>and Roger</li><li>Don't Get Your Hopes Up</li><li>Henry Halfhead</li><li>Wanderstop</li><li>Wednesdays</li></ul><h3>Gameplay Design</h3><ul><li>Absolum</li><li>BallxPit</li><li>Dawnfolk</li><li>Hades 2</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Keep Driving</li><li>Look Outside</li><li>Öoo</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li><li>The King is Watching</li></ul><h3>Innovation</h3><ul><li>Blue Prince</li><li>FREERIDE</li><li>Gas Station Story</li><li>PBJ The Musical</li><li>Ruffy and the Riverside</li><li>Taria &amp; Como</li></ul><h3>Latin American Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Adventure of Samsara</li><li>despelote</li><li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo</li><li>Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</li><li>Taria &amp; Como</li><li>Tormented Souls 2</li></ul><h3>Music</h3><ul><li>Everhood 2</li><li>Herdling</li><li>Rift of the NecroDancer</li><li>SONOKUNI</li><li>Sword of the Sea</li><li>Wheel World</li></ul><h3>Narrative</h3><ul><li>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</li><li>Consume Me</li><li>Promise Mascot Agency</li><li>The Drifter</li><li>The Roottrees are Dead</li><li>The Séance of Blake Manor</li></ul><h3>Solo Development</h3><ul><li>Lushfoil Photography Sim</li><li>Megabonk</li><li>NAIAD</li><li>Spilled!</li><li>Tall Trails</li><li>Vile: Exhumed</li></ul><h3>Southeast Asian Indie Game Award</h3><ul><li>Afterlove EP</li><li>Artis Impact</li><li>Glyphica: Typing Survival</li><li>SEDAP!
