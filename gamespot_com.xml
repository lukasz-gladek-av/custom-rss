                <p>Ubisoft is reportedly making a new battle royale game that's inspired by Apex Legends, so much so that the project once used the game as a thumbnail.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-ubisoft-is-developing-a-new-battle-royale-heavily-inspired-by-apex-legends/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft's new battle royale game is codenamed "Scout" and has been in development for a few years already. Its characters are said to be similar to Apex Legends' own Pathfinder, Wraith, and Lifeline, as well as others.</p><p>The company's higher-ups reportedly wants to take advantage of Apex Legends' dwindling player base. As a result, they are said to think that there's now an opportunity to launch another battle royale game. This is despite Ubisoft's internal research team indicating that engagement in battle royale games is on the decline.</p><p>Ubisoft has already entered the battle royale genre with Hyper Scape. However, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-scape-servers-are-shutting-down-april-28-ubisoft-says/1100-6500039/" data-ref-id="1100-6500039">servers were shut down back in April 2022</a>. Ubisoft was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-making-a-hero-shooter-battle-royale/1100-6502182/" data-ref-id="1100-6502182">reportedly making another battle royale game, codenamed Pathfinder</a> (unrelated to the Apex Legends character), but it's unknown whether its related to project Scout in any way.</p><p>Ubisoft attempted to replicate Call of Duty's success with xDefiant, but the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutting down in June</a>. Ubisoft has recently created a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/" data-ref-id="1100-6530434">new dedicated subsidiary</a> focusing on its three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cy, and Rainbow Six. Ubisoft is reportedly working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-rainbow-six-tactics-game-is-reportedly-in-development/1100-6530655/" data-ref-id="1100-6530655">tactics game set in the Rainbow Six universe</a>.</p><p>As for Apex Legends, EA has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-teases-a-bigger-newer-apex-legends-2-0/1100-6529289/" data-ref-id="1100-6529289">teased some sort of "Apex Legends 2.0,"</a> but it still seems a while away.</p>

This price adjustment will enable us to continue bringing high-quality games and benefits to your PlayStation Plus subscription service."</p><p>Unfortunately, Sony isn't offering any new perks for PS Plus to help offset the price increases. Still, players will have access to the PS Plus Catalog and free monthly games by subscribing to the service. It's unclear what impact tariffs may be having on these price increases, but experts have suggested that tariff-related increases won't be limited to US pricing.</p><p>The new prices in Canadian dollars are as follows:</p><ul><li>PlayStation Plus Essential 12-month subscription — $110 (previously $95)</li><li>PlayStation Plus Extra 12-month subscription — $190 (previously $155)</li><li>PlayStation Plus Premium 12-month subscription — $225 (previously $190)</li></ul><p>Sony already announced that it would be raising <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/ps-plus-price-hikes-strike-even-more-countries" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS Plus prices in other countries starting today such as South America and Australia</a>.

NetEase hasn't provided more details, only that players can "head to the store, grab your unlock, and dive into the look that fits your vibe."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-2-update-adds-emma-frost-krakoa-map-and-cosmetic-gifting/1100-6530825/" data-ref-id="1100-6530825">Marvel Rivals Season 2</a> launched earlier this month, introducing the mutant Emma Frost as a new playable <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard</a> hero to mix up the game's meta with her powerful frontline defenses and potent damage-dealing combos.

                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>
