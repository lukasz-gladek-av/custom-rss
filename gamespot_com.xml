                <p>Bethesda has <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1KRRsVdu4nMcnUWMCqBsXS/season-20-glow-of-the-ghoul?linkId=100000345226123" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> what's next for Fallout 76, and the next major update for the online game is coming soon. Fallout 76 Season 20: Glow of the Ghoul arrives March 18 as part of the Ghoul Within update. This long-awaited update allows players to become ghouls for the first time.</p><p>"Glow of the Ghoul is all about the Ghouls. This theme is for the mutated, the irradiated, the glowing and the feral of the wasteland," Bethesda said in its announcement.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">allowing players to become a ghoul</a>, the new update adds a variety of toxic-waste-themed items for players to use to deck out their C.A.M.P.s. This includes the "Unfortunate End" nuclear waste tank, the "Mini Nuke Stein," and the "Goo-Tub."</p><p>You can see some of this new content in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfVn-bvQkc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uvfVn-bvQkc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bethesda announced in June 2024 that an update to Fallout 76 would allow them to become a ghoul. The Fallout TV show features Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and he became a fan-favorite.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a Ghoul, you have that natural resistance to radiation. In fact, you even benefit from radiation in a lot of different ways," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">Bethesda told GameSpot in an interview</a>. "So that on its own will open up a number of different play styles. So if I benefit from radiation and a lot of players wear power armor to stave off radiation, as a Ghoul, I want to absorb it."</p><p>Bethesda also published a roadmap for Fallout 76's next few months, showing off what's coming in terms of seasonal events and double-XP opportunities. The next big update after Glow of the Ghoul doesn't have a name or any details yet, but it'll be released with Season 21 sometime in June.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680"></a><figcaption>Here's what's next for Fallout 76.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond ongoing support for Fallout 76, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>.
