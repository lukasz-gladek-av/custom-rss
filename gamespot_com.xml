Palace Heist is a standalone game that can be enjoyed solo or cooperatively with another player. The format makes it uniquely situated in the ever-expanding Lorcana TCG, as it's ideal for brand-new players as well as seasoned Lorcana enthusiasts looking for a change of pace. Palace Heist is only the second Illumineer's Quest standalone game in the TCG's nearly two-year history. It launched in early June alongside several other Reign of Jafar products, some of which are also discounted right now. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Collectors/dp/B0DDPM3PL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar's 24-pack Booster Box (288 cards)</a> is on sale for $114 (was $144).

This 2024 bundle comes with two single-player decks, six booster packs, and a Glimmer Foil  Mickey Mouse Pirate Captain promo card. The bundle originally sold for $45 and was thought to be out of print, so Amazon's restock is a nice surprise.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0DFW7N2D4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Palace Heist (Solo/Co-op Game)</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4mivMFZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Azurite Sea: Stitch Collector's Gift Set</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Inklands/dp/B0FD56QNZJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Inklands Bundle (New Restock)</a> -- $35 (<del>$45</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Collectors/dp/B0DDPM3PL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar: Booster Box</a> -- $114 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/45dk9cq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ursula's Return: Booster Box</a> -- $110 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/4miXlyV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Archazia's Island: Booster Box</a> -- $108 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/3ITlWMv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Azurite Sea: Booster Box</a> -- $103 (<del>$144</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Comprehensive/dp/B0DDPS635W?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reign of Jafar: Illumineer's Trove</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Comprehensive/dp/B0DDL55ND5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Archazia's Island: Illumineer's Trove</a> -- $40 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble (Solo/Co-op Game)</a> -- $55.36 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://amzn.to/478k3W9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Into the Inklands: Amber &amp;

Players place character and item cards from their deck on the game mat and square off against Jafar's 50-card deck. Your objective is to make it through the palace and secure the Reforged Crown. It's not a straightforward journey, however, as Supreme Sorcerer Jafar has plenty of tricks up his sleeve to impede your progress.</p><p>Palace Heist is a compelling variant on Lorcana that is especially great for those who don't always have someone around to battle. It's also a good tool to introduce new players to the game, since it's fully playable as a single-player experience as well as cooperatively with one other player. You can also use the cards in the standard Lorcana TCG.</p><p>Illumineerâ€™s Quest: Palace Heist includes the following:</p><ul><li>1 Jafar Scenario Deck (50 cards)</li><li>2 Player Decks (60 cards each)</li><li>1 Oversized Jafar Card</li><li>4 Battleground Cards</li><li>1 Reforged Crown Tile</li><li>1 Palace Heist Playmat</li><li>1 Jafar Draw Token</li><li>5 Lore Tracker Tokens</li><li>29 Damage Counters</li><li>1 Victory Card</li><li>Palace Heist Rules Sheet</li></ul><p>As mentioned, this is the second Illumineer's Quest game. The first, Deep Trouble, released as part of the Ursula's Return set in May 2024. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Illumineers/dp/B0CGXJ8244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Illumineer's Quest: Deep Trouble</a> still regularly sells for full price, though you can save a few bucks at Amazon. It's worth clarifying that Palace Heist and Deep Trouble are different games with unique scenarios and entirely separate decks of cards, so both games are worth checking out.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">These days, Baldur's Gate 3 is probably the first thing that comes to mind when people think "Dungeons &amp; Dragons video games," but there's a long history of D&amp;D video games stretching back to before Baldur's Gate 3--or even its predecessors like Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, Planescape Torment, and Neverwinter Nights--ever existed. Throughout the '80s and early '90s, there was a long list of titles like Eye of the Beholder, Pool of Radiance, and Champions of Krynn that adapted older D&amp;D editions into video game form--and many are still considered important classics that are worth revisiting today. If you've ever been curious about these beloved PC games, you'll want to check out Humble's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+30+Classic+D%26D+PC+Games+For+%2410&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-07-30+13%3A17%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-07-30+16%3A11%3A03&amp;fnarticle_id=6533569&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fgames%2Fdungeons-dragons-classics-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-30-classic-dd-pc-games-for-10%2F1100-6533569%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection</a> game bundle, which includes up to <strong>30 old-school D&amp;D PC RPGs, strategy, and action games, for just $10.</strong> But you'll want to act fast, as the bundle will <strong>only be available until August 7</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other Humble bundles, a portion of all Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection revenue is donated directly to charity. For this deal, Humble is donating proceeds to Covenant House, which provides food, shelter, and ongoing services to homeless and trafficked young people. If you want to donate more, you can increase your pledge beyond $10 and change the revenue split between Humble, the game publishers, and Covenant House before checkout.</p><p dir="ltr">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers two payment tiers, and the more you pay, the more games you get. The bundle's base $5 includes six games, four of which are standalone releases, including the top-down action-adventure game Al-Qadim: The Genie's Curse, the classic dragon-flying combat sim DragonStrike, the kingdom-building strategy sim D&amp;D - Stronghold: Kingdom Simulator, and DeathKeep, which is a fast-paced action-RPG with gameplay inspired by 90s first-person shooters. The other item in the bundle is Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection Three, which includes two classic D&amp;D dungeon-crawling CRPGs: the party-based "blobber" Menzoberranzan--which stars iconic D&amp;D character Drizzt Do'Urden--and the hardcore roguelike Dungeon Hack.</p><p dir="ltr">If you pay $10 or more, you'll unlock the full bundle, which includes everything from the previous tier. Most of the other items in this tier are multi-game collections with between two and eight titles each, totaling 30 games (a $109 value). There are several notable inclusions in this tier, but one of our favorites is the Forgotten Realms: The Archives Collection One, which bundles the Eye of the Beholder trilogy--often considered three of the best dungeon-crawling RPGs ever made--into a single title. If you've ever played the Legend of Grimrock games, you'll immediately recognize the gameplay style of Eye of the Beholder 1-3, which still holds up well today despite being over 30 years old.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540967"></a><figcaption>Humble's Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection PC game bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4540967-dndgamespchumble.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The full list of games in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Classic Collection offers a varied list of genres and worlds--including popular campaign settings like The Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, and Spelljammer, as well as more obscure worlds like Darksun and Ravenloft--making it a great source for classic D&amp;D lore and history.

For those who want a streamlined, easy-to-set-up version of the game, the upcoming Dungeons &amp; Dragons x Stranger Things: Welcome to The Hellfire Club looks to be a solid entry point for the TTRPG.

<section><p>Despite taking the character and series in a fresh direction, Bananza retains a surprising number of elements from Rare's Donkey Kong titles.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Donkey Kong may have been Nintendo's first breakout star, but for decades, the character was more commonly associated with other developers than he was with his creators. While numerous studios have put out Donkey Kong titles over the years, the simian really came into his own under the stewardship of Rare, who reinvented the character with 1994's seminal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-country/" data-ref-id="5000-2887">Donkey Kong Country</a>. Though it hasn't been involved with the series since the early 2000s, Rare's work was so beloved that it effectively defined Donkey Kong for the next two decades--and that influence can still be felt throughout the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza/" data-ref-id="5000-671287">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">It's surprising how much of Rare's DK survived in Bananza. Despite some visual references to past Donkey Kong titles, everything Nintendo had shown off leading up to the game's launch suggested it would be a complete reboot of the series. Even beyond the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-raises-the-possibility-of-a-dk-multiverse/1100-6532529/">lore implications</a> of Donkey Kong teaming up with an inexplicably young Pauline, Bananza's freewheeling, destructive gameplay and subterranean setting are a marked departure from the Donkey Kong Country of old, giving the game a flavor and identity that's wholly distinct from every DK title before it.</p><p dir="ltr">This first impression is not entirely off the mark; right from the outset, Bananza feels like a new direction not just for the character, but the series as a whole. While the game boasts plenty of platforming challenges to overcome, its core loop revolves around smashing your way through dense environments, using DK's mighty strength to carve up the terrain and unearth hidden collectibles. It makes for a decidedly different gameplay experience than previous Donkey Kong titles. And yet, despite this stark change in direction, Bananza still retains a number of elements that Rare's Donkey Kong games pioneered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540931"></a><figcaption>Some of Bananza's challenge stages are overt callbacks to iconic Donkey Kong Country levels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540931-img_7006.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can see vestiges of the studio's influence all over the game design. Many of the elements that have become hallmarks of Rare's Donkey Kong reappear in Bananza. Balloons, initially your life counter in the Donkey Kong Country series, return in a similar role, ferrying you back to safety when you plummet into a bottomless abyss. DKC mainstays like Cranky, Diddy, and Dixie Kong make recurring cameos throughout the adventure, cropping up in unexpected places as you make your way to the planet's core. Even the soundtrack pays homage to Rare's games, interspersing iconic songs like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPmW6eLX5fw&amp;list=PLbcFKfjvYToWpxtdblXwn7-Ct7_P5qr9i&amp;index=4">DK Island Swing</a> and the DK Rap amongst all the new tracks.</p><p dir="ltr">Rare's lingering influence is even more prominent in Bananza's challenge levels. Battle arenas, which task you with defeating a specific number of enemies against a time limit, take obvious inspiration from similar challenges in Donkey Kong 64, right down to their staging. Some of the platforming courses that DK encounters on his quest, like the fittingly named Nostalgia Country, are even more overt callbacks, playing out like traditional side-scrolling levels with iconic backdrops from DKC. These stages have the same impact as the 8-bit sections in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-odyssey/" data-ref-id="5000-458832">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, offering a pleasant, nostalgia-stirring surprise for longtime fans that lovingly harkens back to the series' roots.</p><p dir="ltr">Bananza shares many other similarities with Odyssey, having been developed by the same team, but both games' freeform structure was, in part, shaped by Rare. Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> established the template that other 3D platformers would follow, Rare built upon it in novel ways with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/banjo-kazooie/" data-ref-id="5000-481">Banjo-Kazooie</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/donkey-kong-64/" data-ref-id="5000-311">Donkey Kong 64</a>. Whereas Mario 64 divided up its courses into different "episodes" that each focused on a specific objective, the levels in Rare's games were proper sandboxes, with all of their collectibles available right from the outset. Not all of them were immediately obtainable; some could only be acquired after returning with the appropriate skill. But players had the freedom to explore a stage and pick up as many collectibles as they could without immediately being kicked back to the hub area, which fundamentally changed the experience--and became the approach Nintendo would eventually adopt with Odyssey and Bananza.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4540932"></a><figcaption>Even Bananza's fossils reference characters and enemies from Rare's Donkey Kong titles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4540932-img_7010.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Even ideas that initially seem unique to Bananza can be traced back to Rare's Donkey Kong games. Bananza's emphasis on music in particular owes a debt to Donkey Kong 64, which likewise incorporated music as a core component of its gameplay. Partway through the Nintendo 64 adventure, each Kong would add a different musical instrument to their repertoire of skills; DK, for instance, would get his (soon-to-be signature) pair of bongos, while Diddy would acquire an electric guitar. When the Kongs played these instruments in the appropriate spot, they'd send out a devastating shockwave attack that would destroy nearby enemies and activate something around the stage, often leading to a Golden Banana.</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to draw a throughline from DK64's instruments to Pauline's powerful vocal cords, which similarly serve multiple purposes in Bananza. On top of triggering the Bananza transformations, Pauline's singing can disperse Void seals, opening up new parts of the level to explore. She can also launch powerful vocal blasts in co-op mode, which will destroy any terrain and enemies in their path.</p><p dir="ltr">For all the ways Bananza charts a fresh new direction for the series, the game is very much indebted to its past. In reclaiming the character, Nintendo could very well have wiped the slate clean and cast aside all traces of Rare's Donkey Kong, making the character wholly its own. But by preserving so many hallmarks from Rare's DK games, Nintendo has tacitly acknowledged that Bananza would not feel like a proper Donkey Kong title without them--that many of the elements Rare introduced have since become core to Donkey Kong's identity.</p><p>With a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-movie-team-returns-for-a-donkey-kong-film-listing-reveals/1100-6533131/">rumored Donkey Kong movie</a> on the horizon, Nintendo will likely lean heavily on the series moving forward. But regardless of where DK goes from here, there will always be bits of Rare in his DNA.</p>
