                <p>The Molasses Flood, the CD Projekt Red-owned studio behind games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-flame-in-the-flood/" data-ref-id="5000-335328">The Flame in the Flood,</a> has fully merged with CD Projekt Red proper, losing its studio identity as it continues work on a multiplayer The Witcher game.</p><p>"We want to let you know that on April 1, 2025, The Molasses Flood LLC (“TMF”) merged with CD PROJEKT RED Inc. (“CDPR Inc.”), a company being a part of the CD PROJEKT Group," a statement on the studio's website reads. "As a result of the merger TMF, in its former legal state (of a separate legal entity) ceased its operations, while CDPR Inc. assumed the rights and obligations of TMF. The merger will not affect the availability or distribution of The Flame in The Flood and Drake Hollow video games, which will continue to be published by CD PROJEKT Group."</p><p>Studio co-founder Damian Isla is also leaving the studio, calling it "the end of the era" in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a LinkedIn post</a> that simultaneously argues that "this is a good and healthy thing for the studio, and it was long-expected." The Molasses Flood was first formed as an independent studio in 2014. In the years that followed, it released the roguelike survival game The Flame in the Flood and the cooperative creature-raising action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/drake-hollow/" data-ref-id="5000-504768">Drake Hollow</a>.</p><p>In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-announces-ambitious-game-coming-from-newly-acquired-studio/1100-6497318/" data-ref-id="1100-6497318">CD Projekt Red acquired the studio</a>, and we eventually learned that this happened because The Molasses Flood was working on a multiplayer The Witcher game currently referred to as Project Sirius. The studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-game-project-sirius-now-has-a-new-framework-dev-hit-with-layoffs/1100-6514111/" data-ref-id="1100-6514111">experienced layoffs in 2023</a> and is now being fully merged into the company that acquired it three years ago.</p><p>"It breaks down some organizational barriers, and better integrates the TMF team with the rest of the amazing CDPR org," Isla explains in his LinkedIn post. "Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka "the multiplayer Witcher game," of which I was the Design Director for three years). It's going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we've been working on."</p><p>Project Sirius has not yet been publicly unveiled and is separate from<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/"> The Witcher 4</a>. The latter is the first in a new trilogy, developed using Unreal Engine rather than CD Projekt Red's previous and proprietary engine</p>

                <p>One of the biggest talking points following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Direct</a> was how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> is priced at $80 USD. That's $10-$20 higher than most major AAA games, prompting people to voice their opinions about the price hike. Nintendo isn't charging $80 for all Switch 2 games, but why is it doing so for Mario Kart World?</p><p>Serkan Toto of Kantan Games told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-are-so-high-according-to-analysts-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Nintendo is doing this simply because they can, and any online "uproar" will blow over in time.</p><p>"I think they raised software prices across all these regions because they think they can," Toto said. "Nintendo already priced in the protest and uproar by part of the fan base, betting this will all blow off and gamers will come to accept a new normal eventually. And I think they will be correct about this."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="33628171" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

charging $700 for the PS5 Pro and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/"

Nintendo Direct. </a></p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said Nintendo looks at each game on a case-by-case basis when it comes to pricing, which is why Mario Kart World is $80 and some other Nintendo Switch 2 games might cost less.</p><p>"We'll look at varying prices and things like that for software based off of just how robust the experience is," Trinen said. "People will get to learn more about that game. And I think that as they start to learn more about that game, they're going to be pretty excited about the content that's offered there."</p><p>According to one retailer, video game prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">need to go up</a> to maintain the overall stability of the market.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch title</a>, arriving alongside the system on June 5. Mario Kart World is included with the Switch 2 in a $500 bundle, though some believe <a href="https://ase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the price might go up due to tariffs.</a></p>

However, one analyst believes that Nintendo won't increase Switch 2's $450 price before launching on June 5.</p><p>David Cole, the founder of the research firm DFC Intelligence, told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-likely-to-stick-with-switch-2s-450-launch-price-despite-trump-tariffs-says-analyst" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> that he expects Nintendo to maintain the $450 price initially, and added "we believe that price point was reached with the threat of tariffs already looming." Cole also said that if the 24% tariffs on goods from Japan remain in place, Switch 2's price could rise 20% within the next two years. He went on to suggest that Nintendo may limit the amount of Switch 2 consoles available at launch in response to the tariffs. Tariffs are even higher on goods coming from China and Vietnam, where Nintendo is manufacturing the system.</p><p>"There may be a supply issue if Nintendo chooses to limit production initially," noted Cole. "Nintendo is very conservative and they don't like to take big risks on having surplus inventory. So they may take a bit of a wait-and-see approach given some of the current unknowns."</p><p>DFC's projection for Switch 2's launch numbers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-sell-fewer-systems-than-previously-thought-analyst-says/1100-6530681/" data-ref-id="1100-6530681">were also revised downward</a> from 17 million to 15 million in 2025. Regardless, Cole remains bullish on Switch 2's potential to grab "an even larger [market] share than the original Switch."</p><p>The Entertainment Software Association has already warned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/esa-says-tariffs-will-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-entire-gaming-industry-not-just-nintendo/1100-6530636/" data-ref-id="1100-6530636">the tariffs may severely harm the video game industry</a> beyond Nintendo. Other analysts have said that video game publishers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tariffs-may-lead-publishers-to-abandon-physical-games-says-analyst/1100-6529858/" data-ref-id="1100-6529858">may abandon physical releases altogether</a> in order to avoid the tariffs.</p>

It appears it will indeed once again return, as an image that leaked from Nintendo Korea's website appears to tease Rainbow Road.</p><p>As spotted by<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-leak-confirms-iconic-tracks-return" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> Eurogamer</a>, the Nintendo Korea website for Mario Kart World posted--and swiftly removed--the image below.
