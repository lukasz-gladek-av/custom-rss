Despite Blizzard largely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-moba-heroes-of-the-storm-is-officially-on-life-support/1100-6505313/" data-ref-id="1100-6505313">ending development on Heroes of the Storm back in 2022</a>, Blizzard's Classic Games team (which now oversees the MOBA) is adding a new skin to the game for the first time in years to celebrate both Heroes of the Storm's anniversary and the recent Warcraft 30th anniversary. The skin, Gear Head Thrall, features a cel-shaded look, as if Thrall took a detour in Gearbox's Borderlands series.</p><p dir="ltr">Better yet, the blog states that the Classic Games team "is combing through the archives, searching for unreleased skins that would need some finishing touches for release," with the possibility of more skins in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all combined with a new <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24206703/heroes-of-the-storm-live-patch-notes-june-2-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">balance update</a> that's live now (something that while infrequent, has continued despite the game not receiving new content), one that fixes various bugs but more notably removes the minimum cast range from a number of abilities like Gazlowe's Grav-O-Bomb 3000, Murky's Pufferfish, Tychus' Frag Grenade, Hanzo's Sonic Arrow, and Brightwing's Arcane Flare.</p><p>Taken all together, it's at least something for fans of what is likely Blizzard's most underrated game. In other Heroes of the Storm news (there isn't much!), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-more-free-to-play-freebies-for-subscribers/1100-6530387/" data-ref-id="1100-6530387">Xbox Game Pass subscribers are now getting more perks in free-to-play games</a> via Game Pass, including access to 30 free heroes in Blizzard's MOBA by linking their <a href="http://battle.net/" rel="nofollow ">Battle.net</a> and Xbox accounts.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s upcoming expansion, The Edge of Fate, launches at an uncertain time in the long lifespan of Destiny 2. It follows the high-octane culmination of Destiny's first era, The Final Shape, and a series of transitional episodes that attempted to tie up some loose narrative threads. You'd be forgiven if you fell off of Destiny 2 after The Final Shape--after all, <em>final</em> is right there in the name. Developer Bungie seems to be trying to walk a tightrope with this new expansion: ideally, The Edge of Fate will be enough to bring back lapsed players, but it also needs to give Destiny 2 a shot in the arm that will keep avid superfans engaged for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to dig into The Edge of Fate at a preview event hosted by Bungie, and after around eight hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that the expansion's big changes bring new life to the game. Its campaign takes some big swings with its environmental puzzles and new methods of traversal, and it overhauls Destiny 2's core gameplay to make it significantly more streamlined and comprehensible. It remains to be seen if that's enough to revitalize Destiny 2 with the numbers it once had or reinforce the game's status as a live-service powerhouse, but it <em>is</em> enough to make me want to play more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Edge of Fate is headlined by a story campaign that takes players to Kepler, a new location located at the far edge of the solar system. Following the conclusion of the story of the battle between the Traveler and the Witness in The Final Shape, The Edge of Fate shifts narrative focus to The Nine, shadowy supernatural beings that predate the Traveler's arrival in the solar system. Instead of powers linked to Light and Darkness, which defined all of Destiny's previous expansions, The Edge of Fate introduces powers related to dark matter--which, in Destiny's universe, is a usable resource that permeates Kepler. The narrative that unfolds features new civilizations, enemies, and a bearded and hipster-glasses-wearing human with an enigmatic backstory and uncertain motives named Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">I spent my time exploring Kepler and engaging with the early part of the expansion's story, and while I found some of the narrative hooks intriguing, I was most impressed with Kepler's world design. The remote planetoid is distinct from Destiny 2's other locations: The dark matter appears as yellow-orange fungal growths that cover many of the surfaces, serving as organic ornamentation for red canyons and purple-green tunnels. The place is not <em>completely </em>alien, though--human architecture, vehicles, and objects are strewn throughout the world, bringing an eerie sense of familiarity to an otherwise foreign place. One of the most impactful scenes in the expansion comes right at the beginning of the opening mission, when you gaze out from a vista at a skybox dominated by a colossal aircraft carrier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397"></a><figcaption>Recognizable human objects are strewn throughout Kepler, contrasting with alien landscapes. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The dark matter diffused throughout Kepler powers the new abilities that you acquire throughout the campaign. In contrast to how Destiny's subclasses and associated skills have traditionally focused on combat, Kepler's "destination abilities" (meaning they are only usable while on Kepler) are geared toward navigating environments and finding secrets. While platforming and light puzzle-solving have always appeared in Destiny campaigns, The Edge of Fate leans more into environmental puzzles than previous expansions, drawing directly on Bungie's past experience with Dungeons and Raids. As such, the new abilities all provide ways of moving through or manipulating levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The first ability you receive is called Matterspark, and it transforms your character into a compact, glowing ball of energy. While you can damage enemies using sparks of energy jettisoned off of your new spherical form, the main purpose of Matterspark is to allow you to travel through tunnels, air ducts, and tight spaces, and to charge up locations throughout the world that open doors or chests. Another ability, called Matterform, similarly provides new means of traversal, allowing you to manipulate particular parts of the environment--such as sheets of metal or loose walls--into temporary bridges and ladders. Many missions that I played also heavily used the Relocator Cannon, an item you pick up at certain points that lets you create portals to move through otherwise inaccessible barriers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398" data-ratio="0.56459330143541" data-width="2926" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398"></a><figcaption>You'll use Matterspark to traverse narrow spaces, but not all tunnels are marked by fungal growths like this one.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These abilities are key to Bungie's goal of making The Edge of Fate play more like a metroidvania than a linear, first-person shooter. The developer has, in fact, invoked this genre multiple times in its discussions about the expansion; game director Tyson Green told me in an interview that the team was directly inspired by Metroid and Hollow Knight when designing the new campaign. In my time with the game, I found that these new abilities provided a welcome injection of new mechanics into the otherwise quite familiar Destiny 2 gameplay. Finding secrets and figuring out how to traverse through new areas is enjoyable, and the promise of being able to return to old areas to use upgraded abilities to unlock previously unattainable chests adds a fun reason to retread earlier paths and fully explore this new planet.</p><p dir="ltr">As is frequently the case with environmental puzzles in shooters, though, the line between enjoyably challenging and deeply frustrating is a thin one. There were several instances throughout my time on Kepler where I struggled to find the specific nooks and crannies that I needed to move my Matterspark ball into; some of these moments of fruitless searching literally doubled the length of what was otherwise a compact mission. I was playing an early build and Bungie is aware of some of the particularly opaque moments of Matterspark traversal, so these may be improved by launch. I am cautiously optimistic that the abilities will be a welcome change of pace, but Bungie is definitely taking risks in order to shake up Destiny's formula.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399" data-ratio="0.56122448979592" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399"></a><figcaption>The Exotic sniper rifle New Land Beyond returns from Destiny 1 in all of its iron-sights glory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In tandem with the new campaign that unfolds on Kepler, Bungie is also implementing significant revisions to the core Destiny 2 experience. While the changes are numerous, two of the most obvious and impactful are an overhaul of the game's UI--called the Portal--and the addition of a shooting range.</p><p dir="ltr">These may sound like marginal updates, but in a game as complex as Destiny 2, they make a huge difference. The Portal represents a fundamental break from Destiny's past, as Bungie is deprioritizing the familiar destinations map and implementing a streamlined menu-based system for selecting and customizing activities. The developer is attempting to throw out Destiny's fairly obfuscated rewards system and the multi-layered map that has often hidden activities away in far corners. It is supplanting them with a system that is meant to give immediate information about what activities are available, how difficult those activities are, what rewards you can expect upon completing them, and any highlighted events or modifiers they might include.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best examples of how the Portal aims to make Destiny 2 more digestible for all types of players is how it organizes activities on the basis of the way you want to play. As a person who plays almost exclusively solo, I have long been frustrated by the way that Destiny 2 hides or discourages activities that are good for playing alone. The Portal improves this by having "Solo Ops" as one of its four core categories of activities. In addition to curating a set of missions that are highly compatible for short play sessions, the interface also made it clear that I would not be punished with lesser rewards or slower progression for choosing to go solo. Other categories include Fireteam Ops, for Strikes and missions that are built for the classic three-person Destiny experience; Pinnacle Ops, for particularly challenging missions that reward the best loot; and Crucible Ops, for PvP gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402" data-ratio="0.561875" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402"></a><figcaption>The Portal makes rewards and tasks much more streamlined.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Portal's other transformative change is the inclusion of a much more extensive set of modifiers and options that you can use to customize a mission's difficulty to your liking. This is a <em>huge </em>change over Destiny's past, where missions generally have only a few difficulty settings and little granular control over the gameplay experience. Now, you can choose from dozens of different buffs and de-buffs, evocative of the way that finding Halo's collectible Skulls unlocked a series of options to tune particular elements of the game. These all affect scoring multipliers, which themselves affect how many rewards you are able to earn in a mission. In addition to allowing high-level players to create extreme challenges, it also lets you, for example, tune things to make a mission easier to complete in less time.</p><p dir="ltr">I found the Portal genuinely transformative to the Destiny 2 gameplay loop. While I have always generally liked the use of the destination map, the improvements to visibility and customizability that the Portal implements will make the game more enjoyable and replayable for many different types of players. I even ended up replaying quick missions multiple times during my preview, just because I was invested in seeing how different combinations of modifiers would affect my performance, enemy difficulty, and the rewards I got. It was exciting to try to push my limits, and that excitement was driven by the fact that I got to choose exactly how I was going to get challenged.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big change to the core Destiny 2 gameplay, the addition of a shooting range, is designed to benefit both beginner and expert players. Destiny 2's gear and stats system is extraordinarily complex, combining both intrinsic weapon and armor perks, user-selected mods, and upgrade mechanics. This has resulted in high-level play increasingly oriented around build-crafting, or the creation of combinations of gear and mods that are most suited to particular tasks. However, this process is more involved than, say, creating a loadout in Call of Duty. It can be extremely difficult to figure out exactly how armor and weapon perks interact, or how marginal increases in character stats impact one's performance. I have played Destiny 2 for hundreds of hours and I am still a relative beginner at build-crafting, as I have found comparing combinations of gear to generally be too difficult and time-consuming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403"></a><figcaption>Lodi, a human, just appeared one day on Kepler. What's he up to?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The shooting range is Bungie's attempt to encourage players to engage more deeply with builds. Located in a corner of the Tower, the shooting range lets players safely experiment with different weapons, gear, and mods to figure out exactly how they want to approach certain encounters or mission types. There are many buttons to hit to change the shooting range's setup (you literally shoot buttons to switch settings), including what enemy types are included, whether a champion spawns, and whether the enemies should engage in combat with you. There is even a big scoreboard that tells you exactly how much damage per second you have put on a target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a stat nerd's dream, but it is also a profoundly useful way of learning Destiny's more involved mechanics. Even in the short time I spent at the range, I found myself quickly picking up on gear complexities that I hadn't been willing to engage with in the past. I was able to carefully investigate how the perks on the new Exotic weapons worked, and I figured out how to match certain mods to significantly increase my combat effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens more additions and tweaks that Bungie is implementing with The Edge of Fate--including a simplification of the armor and power systems--that I generally found to make my gameplay experience more enjoyable. However, it is still unclear if Bungie has done enough to bring back the lapsed Destiny players who have fallen off at some point over the game's long history, or to entice new players who have never touched the game before. Destiny is a daunting game in many ways, and despite The Edge of Fate attempting to initiate a new, more welcoming phase, there is a lot of narrative and mechanical intricacy that has accumulated over the years. Bungie has to find a way to simultaneously signal that it's a good time to (re)join the Destiny community, while also giving its committed players both continuity and new treasures to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">In the absence of a truly clean break in the form of a new sequel, I don't think this challenge is getting any easier–and I'm not sure Kepler, the Portal, and the Shooting Range will fully solve it. Despite all that, I am optimistic about the swings that Bungie is taking with the expansion, especially those that overhaul the core game. You're likely to find me spending too much time fiddling with weapon mods at the shooting range when The Edge of Fate launches on July 19.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I love weird little guys. It's a truism about me that crosses games, genres, and mediums. It's the reason why, even if I didn't realize it at the time, Toad has been my main Mario Kart racer since I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet of my living room mere inches from the glow of Mario Kart 64. And it's one reason why Mario Kart World has me so excited: It's a veritable treasure trove of weird lil guys.</p><p dir="ltr">By now we all know about Cow, the breakout star from the Switch 2 reveal presentation. Everyone loved the outside-the-box approach of plucking a background creature from one stage of Mario Kart and including her as a racer. And to hear Nintendo tell it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">Cow was the eureka moment</a> of their whole approach to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/">racers in Mario Kart World</a>. Once you've thrown Cow into the mix, nothing is off-limits.</p><p dir="ltr">I enjoy the novelty of Cow, but I've never gravitated toward heavy racers. Mario Kart has always felt best to me when I'm behind the wheel of someone light and zippy with a tight turn radius. So I can <em>respect</em> Cow even if I don't expect to actually race as Cow very often. But the philosophy behind Cow has enabled a smorgasbord of other, equally unconventional racers, and I spent a recent extended hands-on session trying all that I could find. I may have even found a new main. (Sorry Toad.)</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with Penguin, another unassuming background character. Penguins are just adorable in general, and this one has a checkered history with Mario in particular. I played as Penguin hoping to get the opportunity to knock Mario off a ledge this time, so I could cackle with righteous fury as I did. <em>Now</em> who's getting thrown off a cliff, plumber? But alas, the stars did not align, and I was never close to Mario to perform such a stunt. Something to anticipate in the final game, I suppose.</p><p dir="ltr">But Penguin was far from the only oddball racer. I tried Chargin Chuck--putting aside my reservations about heavy racers, I enjoyed his grunting meathead persona behind the wheel. I played as Swoop, the little purple bat enemy you forgot about from Super Mario World. I played as Monty Mole, an adorably portly little fellow who looks like he should be having afternoon tea with a badger in a storybook. The list goes on and on.</p><p dir="ltr">But my favorite of all was Para-Biddybud. The little ladybug-like creature looks like a Poke Ball grew eyes and wings. He's lightweight, making him a great match for my preferred racing style. And he's just so gosh darned cute.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the racers has a little personality animation they display when you hit the weapon button without a weapon equipped. Para-Biddybud turns toward the camera and smiles with his eyes--he <em>smizes</em>--and makes a little trilling squeak. All of the racers I could find also had some themed kart they could equip, and Para-Biddybud rides in style in a little rounded kart that has the same ladybug pattern as his body. After only 15 minutes, I got viscerally angry when other racers would hurt my dear sweet Biddybud. He's just a wee fella! What is wrong with you?!</p><p dir="ltr">The one drawback of this expanded roster is that not everyone gets a series of costume changes. The core Mario cast does, which means mostly humanoid-type characters or established racers like King Boo. There are no costumes, as far as I can tell, for Cow or Swoop or Para-Biddybud. That also means that lunch bags don't change you to a random costume; they just give you a speed boost.</p><p dir="ltr">But hey, they have to save something for the DLC, right?</p>

                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2's launch this week</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reflected on the first Switch console in a new video. As Huang explained, Nintendo had an ambitious goal to create a gaming device that was "powerful enough" to run first-party games at home and still be small enough to be used while on the go.</p><p>"We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade, drawn together by a shared belief that technology should serve creativity, and that joy is worth engineering for," Huang said in a Nintendo Creator's Voice video, while also reflecting on late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's vision for the system.</p><p>"I still remember the day Iwata shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day."</p><p>According to Huang, the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip for the Switch took over "500 engineer years" to develop, and the company had to "reinvent everything" for the Switch 2. Huang added that it achieved three major breakthroughs on the Switch 2: full-hardware ray tracing, dedicated AI processors, and "ultra low power" through optimized semiconductor process technology for high performance. The Nvidia CEO claims that this has led to the most advanced graphics ever seen in a portable device.</p><p>The Switch 2 represents a major step forward for Nintendo in terms of graphics, as the hybrid console is capable of rendering games at up to 4K resolution and 60fps when docked. This means that some good-looking games will be coming to the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">like Cyberpunk 2077</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Witcher 4 - Unreal Engine 5 Tech Walkthrough | State Of Unreal 2025</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">From there, The Witcher 4 protagonist walks along a path before meeting up with her buddy, Kelpie. She saddles the horse and takes off at a gallop. CD Projekt Red uses this moment to demonstrate the black mare's muscle movement and fluidity with Unreal Engine 5. The developer transitions from this fauna to highlight <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine" rel="nofollow ">nanite foliage</a> in the open-world game.</p><p dir="ltr">Meeting back up with Ciri (and Kelpie), The Witcher 4 tech demo introduces the port town of Valdrest. After jumping off her horse, Ciri takes down her hood to walk around the market. CD Projekt Red is proud of how when she bumps into a person carrying a crate of apples, the fallen fruit leads to a boy and pigs running toward the food organically.</p><div tabindex="0"

<p>Saruhashi notes that although making sequels is the easier and safer option, NIS does things differently. "In our case, we’re more driven by whether our fans want a sequel. If there’s demand for it, we’ll make it.”</p><p>In regards to making new IP, he said that it's imperative for a mid-sized company to dare to do things big companies can't risk in order to survive. He added, "If we were to stop taking on new challenges, we would be like a fish out of water--I think we’d die.”</p><p>These new and experimental titles are however being given limited budgets, which means developers need to come up with creative solutions. But in the interview, Mizokami commented that she prefers the thrill of problem-solving within a tight budget, saying that she'd "probably get bored halfway through" if suddenly given a multi-million budget. Saruhashi and Mizokami instead liken NIS's approach to "speedrun/real-time attack-style game development.”</p><p>NIS nonetheless still has some notable franchises it continues to release, including the Disgaea series, while its Western counterpart NIS America publishes the international release of the Trails series.</p>
