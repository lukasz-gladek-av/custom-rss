The movement is fast-paced and sweaty this year, so you'll want to make sure you have the best perks and Wildcards to suit your playstyle. Here we provide you with some recommendations for your next match of multiplayer.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</a><ul><li><a href="#Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</a></li><li><a href="#Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</a></li><li><a href="#Specialty_bonuses">Specialty bonuses</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_perks_for_multiplayer">Best perks for multiplayer</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_1_slot">Perk 1 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Reduced weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving. Take less fall damage.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a perk you might've overlooked in recent years, but it's a top choice for Black Ops 6. This perk is best suited for you if you plan on making the most of the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6s-action-hero-movement-changes-call-of-duty-for-the-better-with-some-risks/1100-6526239/"> game's omnimovement</a>. The benefits work really well to help you keep more control for gunfights while sliding, diving, and jumping around.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ghost:</strong> Undetectable by enemy Scout Pulse and UAV while moving, planting, defusing, or controlling.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk for staying off the radar if you're a player who wants to go for stealthy plays. It's also a great choice to use for laying low with a sniper class.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Ninja:</strong> Move more quietly</p><p dir="ltr">Like Ghost, this perk can be used for stealthy plays. It's also one of the best picks for non-respawn modes like Search and Destroy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390640"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 perks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390640-blackops6perks.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_2_slot">Perk 2 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Fast Hands:</strong> Swap weapons faster and extend fuses when throwing back grenades.</p><p dir="ltr">Movement and speed are so important in a fast-paced game like Black Ops 6. Having the faster weapon swap can really save you when your primary runs out of ammo.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Assassin:</strong> Enemies on a kill streak get a unique minimap marker and drop bounty packs when killed. Pick up the packs for more score.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dispatcher:</strong> Reduced score cost for non-lethal streaks. Stacks with Bankroll.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fast Hands and Assassin are going to be more popular picks for aggressive players, Dispatcher is a great pick if you like to lean into a support role. It's also great for leveling up faster, as you'll get your UAVs and other support streaks faster, equalling to more score opportunities.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perk_3_slot">Perk 3 slot</h3><p dir="ltr"><strong>Double Time:</strong> Greatly increased duration of Tactical Sprint.</p><p dir="ltr">This is going to be a popular pick for aggressive playstyles. This is the perk you want to run when you're the player rushing to capture hardpoints or just the run-and-gun playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Bankroll:</strong> Start each life with +150 score towards scorestreaks.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a great perk to pair with Dispatcher because it stacks. This is a great pick for getting your support streaks even faster, and together these perks should give you more opportunities to earn XP and level up fast.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cold-Blooded:</strong> It's always good to have at least one loadout equipped and labeled as your Cold-Blooded class. This makes it easy to switch and save yourself, if you find you're in a match where you're getting hammered by lethal enemy streaks.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_Wildcard_picks">Best Wildcard picks</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390641"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Wildcards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390641-wildcards.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6 brings back Treyarch's Wildcard system. Each loadout can be equipped with one Wildcard to help you further customize your loadout to your preferred playstyle. Here are some recommended options:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Overkill:</strong> Equip and non-melee weapon in Primary and Secondary slots.</p><p dir="ltr">Overkill is not a perk this year. If you want to run an additional primary weapon, you'll need to equip this wildcard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Gunfighter:</strong> Get three extra attachments for your primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">If you can't decide on just five attachments for your gun, Gunfighter lets you add three more for a very powerful weapon build.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Perk Greed:</strong> Equip an extra perk.</p><p dir="ltr">It's always handy to have an extra perk, especially with so many good perks being stacked in the Tier 1 slot. This will let you equip Ghost and Ninja together for added stealth, and this is also a good combo for Search and Destroy players.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Specialty_bonuses">Specialty bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390642"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6 Combat Specialist</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390642-combatspecialist.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that perks are all labeled using three different categories: Enforcer (red), Recon (blue), and Strategist (green). If you fill your loadout with three perks from the same category, you'll get an additional bonus.</p><p dir="ltr">This won't always be the best route to take, but one combo that does work well and gives you decent perks with a helpful bonus is equipping <strong>Dexterity</strong>, <strong>Assassin</strong>, and <strong>Double Time</strong> for an aggressive playstyle. <strong>This earns you the Enforcer bonus</strong>, which grants you a temporary buff to movement speed and health regen rate.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for Black Ops 6 weapon builds to pair with your perks, we have several <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-weapon-loadouts/2900-5892/#1">recommended builds to try in your next match of multiplayer</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're on console, we have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-settings/1100-6526279/">recommended settings guide</a> for getting the most out of Black Ops 6 on PlayStation or Xbox consoles.</p>

                <p>8BitDo has officially revealed its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first dedicated mobile controller</a> in the vein of the <a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi V2</a>. The cradle design coupled with the signature features of the manufacturer's stellar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate controllers for PC and Nintendo Switch</a> makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> an eye-catching option, especially since it's priced at only $50. Available to preorder now at Amazon, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> variants starting November 29.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg"></figure><p>Like its high-end controllers, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller features triggers and joysticks with Hall Effect sensors, which prevents stick drift and generally offers a smoother feel. It also has two customizable rear triggers, a dedicated turbo button, and it'll fit any phone between 3.93 inches (100mm) to 6.69 inches (170mm) in length. That covers the vast majority of modern phones. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest phone, is 6.42 inches in length. The controller's design of this looks quite comfortable as well, as it adds a more traditional gaming profile to a phone.</p><p>It also supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, an easy-to-use customization suite that lets you remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and more.</p><p>The main, and fairly substantial, caveat here: It's only confirmed to support Android, but other 8BitDo controllers listed with Android-only mobile support have worked on iOS just fine. GameSpot has reached out to 8BitDo to see if official support for iOS is planned and whether it will work in some capacity with iPhones at launch.</p><p>Since the controller syncs via Bluetooth, not via USB-C like the Backbone, we would be surprised if it didn't support iOS. 8BitDo's other controllers do work with Apple devices via Bluetooth, and its Ultimate Software app is available through the iOS Store.</p><p>If it works at all--and again, we are speculating here--the Ultimate Software app is the key feature that could be missing on iOS. If 8BitDo doesn't or isn't able to add the controller to the list of devices that sync with the app on iOS, iPhone users wouldn't be able to remap inputs or make other adjustments--unless they also have an Android device or the controller is capable of syncing with the PC app to make changes. Remapped inputs and other adjustments are typically saved to the controller, so if you own an Android tablet or an old Android phone with 9.0 firmware or higher, you could theoretically make those changes on that device before using it on iPhone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589" data-ratio="0.6041095890411" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller has two ergonomically designed rear triggers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png"></figure><p>We'll update this article if and when we hear from 8BitDo about iPhone compatibility. Considering Apple has made a push into AAA gaming on iOS with titles such as Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller and its myriad customization features would be a boon for iPhone users.</p><p>Nevertheless, Android users have an exciting new controller option to look forward to. 8BitDo's controllers almost always punch above their price, so the 8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller should be on your radar. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Joystick-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CPY7H952?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Wireless 2.4GHz Wireless</a> is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controller in 2024</a>, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth Wireless Controller</a> is our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">favorite third-party controller for Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>At $50, 8BitDo's mobile controller is half the price of the Backbone One, the leading cradle-style mobile controller. Backbone One costs $100 and doesn't have rear triggers or Hall Effect sticks/triggers. It does offer dedicated support for iPhone and Android via USB-C (or Lightning), including a handy app that collects your games in one console-style launcher. The USB-C connection also mitigates latency concerns, whereas Bluetooth can add a bit of latency. 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers typically work great via Bluetooth, but it's worth mentioning here.</p><p><strong>8BitDo:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (White)</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (Black)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p><strong>Backbone One:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_WCopub4HusdMMWHmtP?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2TJW4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lighting, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>In related news, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is also available to preorder</a><span> now for $40 at Amazon.
