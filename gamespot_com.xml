          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the second crossover, it's with indie sensation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a>. A Balatro-inspired trinket for Naoe and an amulet for Yasuke, both called "Winning Hand," have been added via the update. The items sport a legendary perk that has a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders. Ubisoft, however, isn't simply giving aways the new item. The patch notes state players will need to "work together to figure out how to get it" but doesn't offer any other clues, so let the hunt begin.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side of things, update 1.0.5 brings some welcome improvements to the Assassin's Creed Shadows' parkour. A new vertical jump option has been added, allowing players to jump up to nearby ledges or awnings without having to wall-run. Other additions include the option to make it so sprint no longer disengages when parkouring up or down, as well as enhanced distance and height for back and side ejects, making it easier for Naoe to keep to the rooftops.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from bug fixes, the other major additions via update 1.0.5 are new photo mode features (like the ability to change the time of day and toggle headgear on or off). Assassin's Creed Shadows' preorder quest, Thrown to the Dogs, is now also unlocked for all players, and revolves around helping a loyal canine companion avenge his master. Completing the quest unlocks the Tsuki-maru pet that can be placed in the game's hideout. The full Assassin's Creed Shadows patch notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.0.5 is just the latest addition to Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft having already detailed what's next for the open-world RPG as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>. An Assassin's Creed Shadows update earlier this month added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-assassins-creed-shadows-update-announced-adds-new-story-mission-and-fixes-a-deer-problem/1100-6531312/" data-ref-id="1100-6531312">new story pack</a>, with updates planned for later this year set to introduce new game plus, additional free story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h2>PATCH SIZES:</h2><ul><li>PS5: ~3.31 GB</li><li>XBS: ~19 GB</li><li>MAC: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~13 GB</li><li>Steam: ~4.3 GB</li></ul><h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h2>"Thrown to the Dogs" Quest Unlocked</h2><p>With this update, all players will receive access to the pre-order bonus quest, "Thrown to the Dogs". Help a loyal dog avenge his late master and unlock Tsuki-maru as a pet to place in your Hideout.</p><p>The quest is available in early game, once you have completed "From Spark to Flame". It can be found at the Tennoji Temple, outside of Osaka.</p><h2>SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS</h2><h2>Dead By Daylight Event</h2><p>We're excited to unveil our first special collaboration with this new Dead by Daylight event coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p><em>As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat...</em></p><p>This event comes with a new free quest that you can access from the Hideout upon unlocking Yasuke as a playable character. Once the event is completed, you will obtain a free trinket and banner.</p><p>You will also be able to further personalize your two characters with a Dead by Daylight-inspired pack in the store, featuring outfits, weapons, trinkets, and the chance to ride off into the shadows with none other than the loyal steed, Maurice.</p><h3>Balatro Trinket</h3><p>We are also adding a new trinket for Naoe, and an amulet for Yasuke called "Winning Hand" -- directly inspired by Balatro. These new items come with a legendary perk that gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders.</p><p>Now... you will need to work together to figure out how to get it!</p><h2>PARKOUR IMPROVEMENTS</h2><p>The team has prepared a bunch of improvements to enhance the parkour mechanics. We want to give a big thank you to all our dedicated parkour players for their ongoing feedback since launch.</p><p>Here are the main changes:</p><h3>New Vertical Jump</h3><p>We're adding a brand-new parkour interaction allowing both Naoe and Yasuke to jump and grab any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall-runs. To trigger it, simply press the jump button as you approach low overhangs, and your character will make the jump.</p><h3>Sprint Toggle Lock</h3><p>As long as the directional inputs are maintained, sprint no longer disengages when using Parkour Up or Parkour Down.</p><h2>Enhanced Back and Side Ejects</h2><p>We've also enhanced the distance and height of side &amp; back ejects, favoring foot landings over hand landings. This includes new animations for Naoe when performing height-gaining side ejects, extending her capacity to remain high-up during parkour.</p><h2>NEW PHOTO MODE FEATURES</h2><p>Photo Mode is receiving its biggest update for an Assassin's Creed game, with the addition of new features to better customize your shots and make the most out of capturing the beauty of Feudal Japan.</p><p>These include the following options:</p><ul><li>Change the time of day</li><li>Play around with numerous poses and facial expressions</li><li>Toggle headgear on/off</li><li>Play music while editing your shots</li><li>Sticker colorization</li><li>New customization frames</li><li>Save Custom Filters</li><li>Reset only one parameter</li><li>Tweak camera speed</li><li>Improved preview mode</li><li>Fullscreen (PC only)</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoy these new customization options! Don't hesitate to share your new Photo Mode shots online using #ACPhotoMode for a chance to be featured on our social media channels (@AssassinsCreed).</p><h2>LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed the issue where players had a persistent New Item notification in their inventory. <em>We did it!</em></li><li>Addressed an issue where some players were given a new save file at level 60, with gear and all objectives uncovered.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the desynchronization warning for 'killing civilians' would appear without any reason.</li><li>Fixed an issue where romancing Lady Oichi before romancing Rin could cause a breakup.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h3>Balancing</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Samurai Daisho and Ronin occasionally gave an extremely high amount of Mon regardless of their level, disincentivizing other methods of gaining Mon.</li><li>We have also partially rebalanced the Mon economy to encourage more world exploration and gameplay activities to earn Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources instead of purchasing them through merchants.</li><li>In pursuit of this, we've bumped up the cost of Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources sold by Merchants and lowered the quantity available each season for each Merchant.</li><li>If you still want to purchase them, we've increased the amount of Mon acquired from completing contracts.</li></ul><h3>World</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Yagoro would become trapped in a Kofun and not return to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could remain stuck inside the construction site at Osaka Castle.</li></ul><h3>Quests</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not exit the quest "Vision of Realms" if they selected 'Quit to Memories' and loaded their progress from the Animus Memories menu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where quitting during the "Nobutsuna Sensei" quest caused Yasuke to become stuck in the flashback.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yaya doesn't join "The League" after being successfully recruited.</li><li>Fixed progress issues in the "Showdown in Sakamoto" quest that happened if Katsuhime previously died.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wake Up Call" quest where the "troublemaker" couldn't be hunted down.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Find Local Dishes" quest where Narezushi could not be obtained from merchants.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wolves and Foxes" quest where players were not able to speak with Hattori Hanzo. <em>I guess we'll let you talk to him now.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in "A Peculiar Guest".</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Missing Missive" quest due to being unable to retrieve the letter.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would crash during the "Temple of the Horseman (An Eye for an Eye)" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest where Katsuhime's letter would sometimes disappear. <em>You got mail!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where the game incorrectly believed Katsuhime was dead and players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Naoe and Katsuhime being attached to surrounding water. <em>They just wanted to go on a little swim!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Katsuhime dropping into the water and swimming to shore.</li></ul><h3>Stealth</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Shinobi Bell effect was blocked by line of sight from NPCs.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><ul><li>Adjusted an issue where the +600% affliction buildup engravings was a text error.

Players took it as a sign that MK1 wouldn't be getting any more updates, and bombarded NetherRealm for continued DLC support. Now, NetherRealm has confirmed that Mortal Kombat 1's reign is coming to a close.</p><p>"We are hearing players' requests for continued game support of Mortal Kombat 1," noted the game's official account on <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020816879206810" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>. "And, while we will continue to support Mortal Kombat 1 through balance adjustments and fixes, there will not be additional DLC characters or story chapters released from this point on."</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/MortalKombat/status/1926020818363924598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a later message</a>, NetherRealm acknowledged that fans may be disappointed by the news, before adding that the devs need "to shift focus to the next project in order to make it as great as we possibly can."</p><p>NetherRealm hasn't officially announced which game is coming next from the studio, but the most likely choice would be Mortal Kombat 2. DC fighting game fans would probably also like to see NeatherRealm get around to Injustice 3, since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/injustice-2-review/1900-6416680/" data-ref-id="1900-6416680">Injustice 2</a> was released eight years ago without getting a proper sequel.</p><p>Earlier this year, NetherRealm added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-adds-a-secret-fight-against-pink-floyd-kind-of/1100-6528939/" data-ref-id="1100-6528939">a pink ninja named Floyd</a> as a hidden battle in Mortal Kombat 1, which may be the final piece of bonus content in the game. Warner Bros. has also recently released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-2-johnny-cage-is-a-list-material-in-new-images/1100-6530158/" data-ref-id="1100-6530158">new images from the Mortal Kombat 2 movie</a>, which will hit theaters on October 24.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Most notably, both the Light and Heavy Bowguns are receiving some substantial buffs, as are the Hammer and Hunting Horn. For the bowguns, various ammo types are seeing a damage increase, as well as an increase to the number of hits when using Dragon Ammo. There are other smaller adjustments too, with the only nerf to come out of the Bowgun changes being a decrease to Elemental Ammo damage.</p><p dir="ltr">For the Hammer and Hunting Horn, both blunt weapons are seeing some major improvements. Hammer is having the "overall" power of its attacks increased, as well as improvements to responsiveness when charging an attack. The hitbox has also been increased for Upswing and sneak attacks. Hunting Horn has seen the damage of some of its key attacks (Echo Bubble, Performance, and Focus Strike: Reverb) increased, as well as a "significant" increase to Encore damage. Capcom has also toned down the visual effects of Echo Bubbles in order to help improve visibility during hunts.</p><p dir="ltr">Those caught up in Monster Hunter Wilds' endgame grind will find more to do soon, as the latest patch makes it so higher-difficulty quests should now appear more frequently as a player's Hunter Rank increases. As detailed in the patch notes, that translates to increased spawn rates for quests with multiple monsters and increased Tempered monster spawn rates. As for monster balance changes, the main change is that monsters resistant to paralysis with now gain more resistance to the ailment each time it's triggered on them, which should make it harder to keep monsters locked down.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the more frequent Tempered monster spawns are five additional Tempered monsters for players to hunt. At Hunter Rank 41 and higher, players can encounter eight star versions of Tempered Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad.</p><p dir="ltr">Fashion Hunters will have more to do as well, with new Hunter and Palico armor sets, outfits for Alma, and additional gestures, pendants, and stickers. Other additions in the patch include the addition of Mandarin Chinese as a language option, the ability to use the rest feature while in tents in Suja and the Grand Hub, and a whole lot of bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes below.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds has proven to be a huge success for Capcom. It's currently the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">best-selling game of 2025 so far</a>, having sold more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hits-a-massive-milestone-free-item-pack-coming-to-celebrate/1100-6530490/" data-ref-id="1100-6530490">10 million copies in its first month</a>, and has helped cement Monster Hunter as one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/capcoms-best-selling-game-franchises-of-all-time-and-whats-next-for-each/2900-6294/" data-ref-id="2900-6294">Capcom's best-selling game franchises</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds Patch 1.011.00.00 Notes</h2><h3>Major Additions and Changes</h3><ul><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration is now available.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration side missions have been added.</li><li>– Street Fighter 6 Special Collaboration Arena Quests have been added.</li><li>– Akuma has been added as an NPC.</li><li>– Akuma-only actions have been added, which can also deal damage to monsters.</li><li>– Five more Tempered Monsters (8★) have been added to the game.
