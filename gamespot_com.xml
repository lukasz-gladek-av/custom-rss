                <p dir="ltr">Vampire Survivors studio Poncle is getting into game publishing, and its first such game is Berserk or Die. Nao Shibata, a solo developer from Japan who makes games under the name Nao Games, revealed the project--an action game with a unique control scheme--is out now.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed during the PC Gaming Show, Berserk or Die uses a keyboard and mouse as a controller--but not in the traditional sense. Players will smack the left and right sides of their keyboard in order to move and attack in that direction--with attack power dependent on how many keys are pressed with each slap--while shaking the mouse will activate the player character's special ability. Accessibility options--including a controller-based control scheme--will also be available.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507611-berserk.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507611-berserk.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507611"></a><figcaption>Berserk or Die</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507611-berserk.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When not in battle, players will shop at nighttime peddlers in order to heal and restore magic, and they can also visit the training grounds to learn new abilities for the next fight. Berserk or Die will feature unique pixel art from Nao Games and music from Vampire Survivors composer Filippo Vicarelli.</p><p dir="ltr">Berserk or Die is the first published game from Poncle, which burst onto the gaming scene in 2023 with its roguelike action game Vampire Survivors. The studio says Berserk or Die is "the first of more projects from Poncle this year, as the studio takes its first steps in the world of publishing."</p><p dir="ltr">Berserk or Die is available now on PC.</p>
