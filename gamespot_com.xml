                <p>MindsEye launched earlier this month but didn't come out of the gate in a great state, with players encountering a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/" data-ref-id="1100-6532343">range of problems, bugs, and other issues</a>. Actor Alex Hernandez, who plays main character Jake Diaz, has now commented on the game's buggy release, offering up his take on what might have happened.</p><p>Speaking to Check It TV, Hernandez he believes developer Build a Rocket Boy decided to launch MindsEye with issues with a plan to fix them after launch.</p><p>"It's not a lack of QA. I met the QA testers and they seemed competent at their job. But for whatever reason, the company decided to release something that has these issues and then taking care of it post-release... obviously we were not the first game to do that," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxfAyV7XBTo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QxfAyV7XBTo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Hernandez said Cyberpunk 2077 is an example of another game that launched in a rough state and was then improved over time with updates.</p><p>Hernandez went on to say that he "doesn't love" the model of a developer selling a game for full price with issues at launch and then fixing it over time.</p><p>"I don't love that model," he said. "I'm not a business person. I have no idea why that decision gets made. I will just say that from a consumer perspective, and I am sure a lot of people feel this way, I think it does more long-term harm than good to your reputation to release something that feels like it is in a state of less-than 100%, and then charge 100% of the price."</p><p>Additionally, Hernandez said he would rather see developers embrace an early-access model where the developer is up-front with players about issues so that fans know what they are signing up for.</p><p>Just ahead of the release of MindsEye, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/" data-ref-id="1100-6532123">pair of senior executives left the developer</a>, while Build a Rocket Boy is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/" data-ref-id="1100-6532630">said to be cutting staff following the game's release.</a> The game was published by Hitman studio IO Interactive.</p><p>Build a Rocket Boy is headed up by Leslie Benzies, the former Rockstar Games veteran. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> scored the game a 3/10. "Impressive visuals can't compensate for a lack of substance, whether that comes from its pointless world, tedious combat, or any number of other egregious shortcomings. If you're looking for quality, cast your mind's eye elsewhere," reviewer Richard Wakeling said.</p>

                <p>In 2022, Epic Games agreed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-finalizes-order-making-fortnite-dev-pay-245-million-in-refunds/1100-6510151/" data-ref-id="1100-6510151">a massive $520 million settlement</a> with the Federal Trade Commission over allegations that Fortnite violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) by collecting info about players under the age of 13 without their parents' permission, as well as allegations that Epic "tricked" players into making unintended in-game purchases. The signup period for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-your-chunk-of-the-245-million-fortnite-ftc-settlement/1100-6517854/" data-ref-id="1100-6517854">the initial distribution of funds</a> ended in February 2024. But now, the FTC is once again opening the opportunity for players to claim their piece of the Fortnite settlement.</p><p>If players already claimed and received a payment from the FTC during the previous dispersal round, then they won't be eligible for any further claims. Everyone else has until July 9, 2025 to to file their claim with the FTC at <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/refunds/fortnite-refunds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the agency's official site</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/FTC/status/1937890559374291285" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">FTC sends $126 million in refunds to Fortnite players who were charged for unwanted items, reopens claims process.

However, this refund is limited to US citizens. Players under 18 will need their parent or guardian to fill out the paperwork, but anyone older doesn't need any special permission to fill out the form. Domestic players can qualify for the refund if any of the following descriptions applies to them.</p><ul><li>You were charged in-game currency for items you didn’t want between January 2017 and September 2022</li><li>Your child made charges to your credit card without your knowledge between January 2017 and November 2018</li><li>Your account was locked between January 2017 and September 2022 after you complained to your credit card company about wrongful charges</li></ul><p>Outside of this settlement, Epic Games has done quite well for itself in legal conflicts.

In this week alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-wins-legal-judgment-against-fortnite-cheater/1100-6532743/" data-ref-id="1100-6532743">Epic announced a very big judgment against a player</a> who sold illegal Fortnite software. Earlier this month, Fortnite launched a separate lawsuit against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-is-suing-fortnite-cheat-makers-and-distributors/1100-6532371/" data-ref-id="1100-6532371">a cheat maker and several associates</a>. In other Fortnite news, it appears that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/it-looks-like-fortnite-blitz-royale-is-sticking-around/1100-6532735/" data-ref-id="1100-6532735"> Fortnite Blitz Royale will be remaining</a> through the winter, at least. There's even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-squid-game-crossover-skins-and-potential-prices-revealed/1100-6532679/" data-ref-id="1100-6532679">a Fortnite x Squid Game collaboration</a> launching on June 27.</p>
