From there, those looking to play together on different platforms will need to add each other's Larian account name to their in-game friend's list. Players will then be able to create a cross-play multiplayer lobby and invite people accordingly. One interesting wrinkle noted by Larian is that if the person hosting the lobby is playing on PC and joined by those playing on consoles or Mac, the lobby host will need to have less than 100 mods installed and only include mods accepted on consoles and Mac.</p><p dir="ltr">The real draw of the update, however, is the new subclasses. The full list of additions can be found below. Larian will be hosting a livestream on April 16 to go over all the new subclasses in more detail.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">College of Glamour Bard</li><li dir="ltr">Path of Giants Barbarian</li><li dir="ltr">Death Domain Cleric</li><li dir="ltr">Circle of The Stars Druid</li><li dir="ltr">Oath of the Crown Paladin</li><li dir="ltr">Arcane Archer Fighter</li><li dir="ltr">Drunken Master Monk</li><li dir="ltr">Swarmkeeper Ranger</li><li dir="ltr">Swashbuckler Rogue</li><li dir="ltr">Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li><li dir="ltr">Hexblade Warlock</li><li dir="ltr">Bladesinging Wizard</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Baldur's Gate 3's previous content update, Patch 7, arrived in September 2024 and added an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-an-official-modding-toolkit-in-upcoming-patch-7/1100-6523885/" data-ref-id="1100-6523885">official mod toolkit</a> and in-game mod manager, as well as "evil" endings, UI updates, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Those waiting to hear more about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-fans-wont-have-long-to-wait-to-find-out-the-future-of-the-franchise/1100-6530188/" data-ref-id="1100-6530188">future of the Baldur's Gate franchise seemingly won't have to wait long</a>, as a Hasbro executive said it's currently working on plans for what's next and will have more to talk about in "pretty short order." Whatever comes next for the series, it won't be from Larian. The developer has already stated its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>, won't be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Baldur's Gate 4</a> but rather something new.</p>
