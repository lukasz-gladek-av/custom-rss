                <p>Between the giant creatures, multiple on-screen characters, and a large map to explore, there's no question that Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-played-monster-hunter-wilds-and-so-far-it-rules/1100-6526070/" data-ref-id="1100-6526070">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is going to demand a lot of power from PCs. Now, less than a month away from the game's release, Capcom has shared a PC benchmark tool to show players how their computer measures up to the system specs.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds benchmark</a> is on Steam's site, and it requires players to have Steam installed and room to download the benchmark itself. The benchmark can rate the performance of your machine and give it a score up to 20,000. Any computer that hits 10,250 and up on the benchmark will be able to play the game. Everything that comes in underneath may take some changes in order to properly enjoy the experience.</p><p>The game's minimum <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/benchmark/#systemrequirements" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">system requirements</a> have also been released and can be seen below:</p><ul><li><dl><dt>Resolution</dt><dd>1080p（FHD）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Frame Rate</dt><dd>60fps (with Frame Generation enabled)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>OS</dt><dd>Windows®10(64-bit Required)/Windows®11(64-bit Required)</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Processor</dt><dd>Intel Core i5-10400<br>Intel Core i3-12100<br>AMD Ryzen 5 3600</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Memory</dt><dd>16GB</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Graphics</dt><dd>GeForce RTX 2060 Super（VRAM 8GB）<br>Radeon RX 6600（VRAM 8GB）</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>VRAM</dt><dd>8GB or more required.</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Storage</dt><dd>75GB　SSD</dd></dl></li><li><dl><dt>Note</dt><dd>SSD required. This game is expected to run at 1080p (Upscaled) / 60 fps (with Frame Generation enabled) under the "Medium" graphics setting. DirectStorage supported.</dd></dl></li></ul><p>Capcom also debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/monster-hunter-wilds-6th-trailer-into-the-iceshard-cliffs/2300-6465662/" data-ref-id="2300-6465662">a new Monster Hunters Wilds trailer</a> that introduces the Iceshard Cliffs and the deadly monsters that dwell there. Once you see that, you'll understand why this game needs so much processing power.</p><p>Players who want to get an early taste of what's to come can join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-another-cross-platform-beta-next-month/1100-6528691/" data-ref-id="1100-6528691">the second open beta test for Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, which will take place on two consecutive weeks: February 6-9 and February 13-16. Most of the content in the second beta will be identical to the first one that was held last November, as players will be able to get their hands on the character-creation tools as well as a story trial, and a Doshagma hunt. In the second beta, the Doshagma hunt is now the jumping-off point for further adventures that can pit players against the Gypceros and Arkveld. Everyone who plays the second beta will be given a Felyne pendant or Seikret, as well as a bonus item pack that will carry over to the main game upon its release.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will arrive on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28. But if players want to get some bonus items ahead of time, all they have to do is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-bonus-monster-hunter-wilds-items-by-playing-monster-hunter-now/1100-6528784/" data-ref-id="1100-6528784">play the mobile game Monster Hunter Now</a>.</p>

Also known as the White Wraith, the Arkveld is a quadruped monster with grayish white scales, fur, and armor.</p><p>The training area will also be accessible, and players will be able to create a private lobby in order to hunt with specific people. The online single player mode will be available as well, which lets players go solo without joining a lobby. While the open beta test does not support PS5 Pro-enhanced features, there will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-console-details-revealed-ps5-pro-support-will-be-in-day-one-patch/1100-6528576/" data-ref-id="1100-6528576">dayone patch to implement PS5 Pro support</a>.</p><p>Characters created in the open beta tests will be carried over to the full version of the game once it comes out on February 28, 2025 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Fans of Wicked certainly felt a stirring when the film finally got to the musical's best-known song, Defying Gravity, but they probably didn't notice the subtle Fortnite sound effect during its final sequence. That's right: Some of the sounds of Elphaba flying in the final sequence are straight from your nephew's favorite battle royale game.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-cant-believe-this-is-true-but-wickeds-biggest-song-features-a-hidden-fortnite-cameo" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, you can see this unlikely detail in a video from the Rough Cut that features Wicked editor Myron Kerstein breaking down the complex final scene of the film, which features a wild mix of visual effects along with the music. At around the 7:20 mark in the video, you can see "All Skydiving Fly Sounds (Fortnite) - Sound effects for editing" right in the middle of the editing timeline.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBAv0Ld38Lk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fBAv0Ld38Lk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This is the sound effect that plays when you jump out of the Battle Bus and shoot towards the ground. Fortnite developer Epic Games released the sound as a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnGwhm9e6fM">royalty-free library sample</a>, and it seems that Kerstein used it to full effect. The Rough Cut video is quite an interesting watch if you're interested in film production or just curious about the amount of work that goes into even a relatively short scene in a big film like Wicked.</p><p dir="ltr">Artists aren't shy about using samples, whether that's in video games, movies, or even music, and you can find lengthy YouTube videos that investigate the origin of these audio clips. For example, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGt57ndBrpU">25-minute video</a> exploring the sources for the music of the Spyro series. In other Wicked news, the hit film <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wicked-film-adaptation-gets-lego-sets-new-book-box-sets-and-more-merch/2900-5759/">got a Lego set</a> and other merch that's definitely worth checking out.</p>
