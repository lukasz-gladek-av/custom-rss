                <p>Horizon fans are eating well this year with impressive remasters and spin-offs, but for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Cyber Monday</a>, you can get them coolest gift of all: the elusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q46YHKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Horizon Forbidden West Tallneck set</a>. Amazon normally sells the 1,222-piece Horizon Tallneck for $105, but you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Q46YHKB?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">snag it for only $63</a>. We expect this deal to sell out <em>fast</em>.</p><h2>Horizon Forbidden West: Tallneck Lego Set (1,222 Pieces)</h2><p><strong>$63 (<del>$105</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405074-lego-tallneck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405074" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405074-lego-tallneck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405074"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Tallneck</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4405074-lego-tallneck.jpg"></figure><p>The Tallneck Lego set has been retired for a while now, and it's not available at any other major retailers. Amazon restocked it relatively recently, but the strange thing is the retailer started selling it for above the original $90 list price. For the past few months if you wanted to build this very cool display model, you would have had to spend $100 or more. This $63 deal price isn't the lowest ever, but it's not far off.</p><p>And considering it's retired, this might be your last chance to get the Tallneck Lego set for anywhere close to this price.</p><p>The Tallneck is a lovely diorama featuring the titular mech, a smaller watcher robot, and a minifigure of Aloy on a decorative base. The finished build is a sight to behold, as it measures 15 inches in height.</p><p>Lego recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-adventures-will-soon-be-an-actual-lego-set-and-its-surprisingly-cheap/1100-6527819/" data-ref-id="1100-6527819">unveiled a 768-piece playse</a>t based on the recently released Lego Horizon Adventures video game. Releasing March 1, this playset features minifigures of Varl and Aloy, as well as the parts to build fearsome Shell-Walker and Sawtooth robots. The Lego Horizon Adventures set is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DHLHC8WN?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder for $45</a>.</p><p>If you still need to add Horizon Forbidden West to your collection, the <a href="https://howl.link/0u35joihznr1w?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17331276525946?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Complete Edition for PS5 is on sale for $40</a> as part of PlayStation's Holiday Deals. <a href="https://howl.link/u42dj5xo4oaj9?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17331276224995?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy also has digital copies for PC for $40.19</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Tablet devices have come a long way over the last decade, but if you're looking for a quality screen, you're going to have to fork out some big cash for it. Fortunately, this Cyber Monday deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMPSWMJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 tablet</a> is a tempting one, as you can pick up a budget tablet for just $140, a 30% discount when compared to its regular $200 asking price.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lenovo M11 Tablet</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>$140 (<del>$200</del>)</strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4407478"></a><figcaption>Lenovo M11</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4407478-lenovo-m11-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lenovo M11 is an 11-inch tablet with a 1920 x 1200 90Hz screen. Specs-wise, it has 4GB of RAM, and an internal SSD storage capacity of 64GB that can be expanded with an SD card. While there are certainly more powerful tablets on the market, this is a great choice for standard, every-day use, especially if you're looking for something to handle simple functions like web browsing, video streaming. It's also a nice option for kids who might be too old for one of Amazon's Kindle tablets, as it comes with a pen that can be used to take notes and create art, similar to the iPad and the Apple Pencil.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">If you need something more durable, Amazon is also selling a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMGKBK9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">version of this tablet for $160 that comes with a folio case</a>, so for the extra cash, you're getting a nice layer of protection with your purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Another affordable tablet you can check out during Cyber Monday is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ for $149</a> (was $220). It has a sharp 11-inch screen 64GB of internal storage capacity that can also be expanded through its MicroSD card slot, and it has a long-lasting battery. Don't expect resource-intensive apps to run smoothly on this, but again, if you're looking to browse the web, stream some TV shows, and do some social media scrolling, this is a budget-friendly tablet that can handle those tasks easily.In case the 64GB model doesn't offer enough room for all the files you want to use on it, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF2DNMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab a 128GB model for $199</a> (was $270). If you own a Samsung smartphone, you can link these devices up to quickly transfer files and photos using the company's app. </p><p dir="ltr">For a little bit more powerful, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-processor-throughout/dp/B0C1MYYFBW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon's Fire Max is another good tablet to consider</a>. This is easily one of the biggest discounts we've seen to date for it, as you can grab 64GB model tablet with a keyboard case and a stylus for just $225 (was $355), or for the tablet on its own, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get it at a 39% discount for $140</a>. The 11-inch screen has a resolution of 2000 x 1200, the battery offers up to 14 hours of use from a full charge, and the included keyboard makes it a good back-up device for when you need to do some work away from home. </p><p dir="ltr">We've listed a few more tablet deals available in Amazon's Cyber Monday sale below. We're also rounding up all the best discounts on video games, electronics, and more at our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Cyber Monday deals hub</a>, so be sure to check that out if you're looking for more savings.</p><h2 dir="ltr">More Cyber Monday Tablet Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMPSWMJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 (64GB)</a> -- $140 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQMGKBK9?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo M11 with folio case</a> -- $160 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF3VPMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (64GB)</a> -- $149 (<del>$220</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLF2DNMV?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ (128GB)</a> -- $200 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-productivity-octa-core-processor-throughout/dp/B0C1MYYFBW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire Max Tablet bundle (64GB)</a> -- $225 (<del>$355</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Fire Max Tablet (64GB)</a> -- $140 (<del>$230</del>)</li></ul><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-collectors-edition-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6524003/">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle Collector's Edition Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-dark-souls-board-game-for-only-51-and-roleplaying-sourcebook-for-30/1100-6527696/">Get Dark Souls Board Game For Only $51 And Roleplaying Sourcebook For $30</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-disc-drive-is-sold-out-at-most-retailers-but-walmart-has-it-for-now/1100-6526391/">PS5 Pro Disc Drive Is Sold Out At Most Retailers, But Walmart Has It (For Now)</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-preorders-live-at-amazon-walmart-and-best-buy/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Is Available Now And Eligible For One-Day Delivery At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-is-on-sale-for-a-great-price/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom Is Already On Sale For 25% Off</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition In Stock On Launch Day For PS5 And Xbox</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-gets-huge-cyber-monday-discount/1100-6525229/">Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Gets Huge Cyber Monday Discount</a></li>   </ul> </div>
