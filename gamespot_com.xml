                <p>Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann recently made headlines when he told fans to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dont-bet-on-there-being-a-last-of-us-part-3-neil-druckmann-says/1100-6529927/" data-ref-id="1100-6529927">not bet on the developer making The Last of Us 3</a>. Now, he's clarified those comments, saying "so many stars have to align" for any given project to come to market, so he can't guarantee anything as it relates to future Last of Us projects.</p><p>Speaking to CTV's Etalk, Druckmann said, "Every project I work on I treat it like it could be my last. I just pour everything into it and leave nothing on the table."</p><p>He added: "When we did the first Last of Us game, that's how I treated it--I wasn't sure I could ever get to make a sequel. It had to have a definitive ending. Likewise when I worked on Uncharted 4--same thing. [Same for] when I worked on The Last of Us 2--I was like, 'I don't know if I'll ever get to do this again.' It had this definitive ending."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcvIqzhEkNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YcvIqzhEkNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The ending in The Last of Us: Part II is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-has-an-ending-in-mind-for-the-last-of-us-tv-series/1100-6530415/" data-ref-id="1100-6530415">what Druckmann is working toward for the overall series</a>, whether it ends with the TV show or another game, he said.</p><p>"For there to be another [game], another thing, another project. So many stars have to align, so I can't guarantee it. Right now, my focus is on this season; hopefully if HBO renews us, next season. And then I am working on a new game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. One project at a time," he said.</p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon.</p><p>The Last of Us Season 2 comes to HBO on Sunday, April 13, and there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-the-last-of-us-season-2-is-shorter-than-season-1/1100-6530337/" data-ref-id="1100-6530337">seven episodes in total</a>. The season covers some of the events of The Last of Us: Part II, but not all of them. In total, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-series-may-end-after-four-seasons-says-hbo-boss/1100-6529478/" data-ref-id="1100-6529478">there could be four seasons of the show</a>, HBO has said.</p>

                <p>The folks working on Balatro have let us know how to properly pronounce the game's title, even though there's no real "wrong" way to do so.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-to-say-balatro" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, publisher PlayStack's head of video marketing Naman Budhwar said, "'BAH-luh-trow' is how local folks say it, but it's kind of a 'gif' and 'jif' situation where [LocalThunk] doesn't really mind how people say it." Anyone can pronounce the word how they want, including variations like "Buh-LAH-trow" and "BAY-lah-trow."</p><p>Balatro recently go its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">fourth Friends of Jimbo pack</a>, which includes collaborations with Dead By Daylight and Assassin's Creed. Past Friends of Jimbo packs included crossovers with games like Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, and Stardew Valley.</p><p>Last month, Balatro had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-confusing-rating-finally-changed-leads-to-europe-changing-how-it-rates-gambling-games/1100-6529673/" data-ref-id="1100-6529673">European classification changed from PEGI 18 to PEGI 12</a> due to an appeal from the game's regional publisher, Sold Out Sales &amp; Marketing. PEGI concluded that even though Balatro taught poker hands, its more fantastical and mystical elements mitigated the gambling-gameplay aspects.</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.

                <p>Backyard Baseball pressed all the nostalgia buttons when it was revived last fall for PC as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-baseball/" data-ref-id="5000-4385">Backyard Baseball '97</a>, a pixel-for-pixel faithful remake of the original game--a challenging project given the revival team didn't have the game's original source code. As of today, March 27, it's available on platforms that didn't even exist when the game debuted: smartphones and tablets for both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/backyard-baseball-97/id6740349666" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">iOS</a> and <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2qZH_9nmCyxb_gYycCVhW6c_EkcZ7D4nV6wUaS0rLtlduYRXJlQEKO9VrtjxDjgkG7qOl0nm5osbFrVa6FRG2OJlnHemcvfzxPRwVOwnQGD_6ZuKpxnbHczwY_sefEb6hkEsB3MF8urEEvhIXgEf5uJtAkaJepkZ5khP36cvCJ-888oPviaCc0RxJYIuNjd08NMgMOBK9-o392kjvEQ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Android</a>.</p><p>Backyard Baseball '97 brings the same experience you might know from PC to smartphones and tablets, featuring touch controls and a few on-screen buttons that replace things like the ESC key that pauses the game on PC. Beyond those minor differences, this is the same experience PC players have access to. Like on PC, it also works with compatible controllers for those who may prefer that method. It's listed at $5.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465957"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465957-unnamed.jpg"></figure><p>The Backyard Sports series debuted with 1997's Backyard Baseball. In subsequent installments, the games tackled a variety of sports like football, soccer, basketball, hockey, and even skateboarding. Reboots of the series have occurred several times since then, first in the PS2 era with 3D takes on the formerly 2D series, and then again a few years later with a pair of Xbox 360 exclusives. A new game in the series hasn't been seen since 2015's pair of mobile-only sequels that were later removed from mobile stores.</p><p>Though Backyard Baseball '97 (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/backyard-soccer/" data-ref-id="5000-6785">Backyard Soccer '98</a>) doesn't feature real-life pro athletes, some later games did when they originally debuted, and Playground Productions has indicated at least some of these players will be returning to future revivals as they release.</p>
