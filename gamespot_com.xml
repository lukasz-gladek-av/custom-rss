                <p>One Ubisoft developer has explained why Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 will rely on Game Key Cards instead of standard cartridges, citing technical limitations of the consoleâ€™s physical media.</p><p>Responding to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry's John Linneman</a> on BlueSky, audio architect for the Snowdrop Engine at Ubisoft Rob Bantin explained that the game "relies heavily on disk-streaming for its open-world environments" and that Switch 2 cartridges simply did not give the performance needed for the game to hit its quality target. "I think if we'd designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different. As it was, we'd build a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cubusaddendum.bsky.social/post/3lxzukm3glk2e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bantin wrote</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars Outlaws Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Game Key Cards have already stirred controversy among Nintendo fans, as they serve as a download-key holder rather than containing the full game on the cart. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-wont-be-tied-to-your-account/1100-6530654/" data-ref-id="1100-6530654">While they can be resold and arenâ€™t console-locked</a>, critics have argued that they pose potential issues for long-term games preservation.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws looks like a respectable third-party game on the Switch 2, as gameplay footage of it so far has shown off a consistent 30fps performance. While it's naturally not as good-looking as the PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S versions, the fact that Ubisoft has managed to get the game running generally well on the Switch 2 bodes well for the system and potential upcoming releases from the company. In comparison, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-rings-switch-2-performance-isnt-that-great-reports-say/1100-6534171/">Elden Ring's Switch 2 performance isn't great at all</a>, according to reports.</p><p>Star Wars Outlaws launched for Switch 2 on September 4, a year after it was first released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. This version of the game includes both of its DLC expansions--Wild Card and A Pirate's Fortune--but the game might be a one-off considering that it wasn't a commercial hit for Ubisoft. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-blames-star-wars-brand-trouble-for-disappointing-outlaws-sales/1100-6533297/">Company CEO Yves Guillemot recently blamed the Star Wars brand</a> being in "choppy waters" as one of the reasons why the game didn't reach Ubisoft's sales expectations, although its worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-is-dropping-forced-stealth-so-you-can-start-blasting-your-way-out-of-trouble/1100-6527925/">reviewers and fans criticized the game</a> for its badly paced intro mission and various technical issues when it first launched.</p><p>Most of these issues have been addressed since then, and the post-launch expansions have been well-received.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Nintendo has just kicked off its Switch 2 era of gaming, but the company is also saying goodbye to its 3DS line of handheld gaming consoles. While Nintendo continued supporting the 3DS and its various models via a repair service in Japan, even after the systems were discontinued, Nintendo began to slowly wind down these operations over the years. The New Nintendo 2DS XL was the last console to be officially supported in this way, but the company has announced that this is coming to an end.</p><p>"As we have run out of parts needed for repairs, we have discontinued repair services for the New Nintendo 2DS XL as of September 4, 2025," Nintendo said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-ends-repair-support-for-new-2ds-xl-meaning-all-3ds-models-are-now-no-longer-supported/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Repairs for all other Nintendo 3DS series systems have also been discontinued."</p><p>This effectively brings the Nintendo 3DS era to a close, as Nintendo no longer has the parts necessary for it to perform repairs on units submitted to its Japanese facilities. The company ended support for the original 3DS handheld in August 2024, and it ran out of parts for the Nintendo 2DS not long after.</p><p>It's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-3ds-and-wii-u-eshop-stores-will-shut-down-march-2023/1100-6500734/">Nintendo closed the eShops for the 3DS and Wii U console back in 2023</a>, with repair support for the Wii U ending last year. While the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-is-is-the-last-week-your-3ds-and-wii-u-games-will-work-online/1100-6522326/">3DS doesn't have online-play functionality anymore either</a>, it's still home to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-3ds-games/2900-3935/">rich collection of games</a> that are available in a physical cartridge format.</p><p>The 3DS was a solid performer for Nintendo, as it went on to sell 75.9 million units worldwide during its run. The evolution of the best-selling Nintendo DS handheld offered an interesting 3D screen gimmick, but later models, renamed to 2DS, would drop this feature entirely. At one point, Nintendo even sold a 2DS that didn't have a clamshell design and was geared toward younger members of the family.</p><p>Meanwhile, it looks like the Switch 2 is off to a solid start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/">Sales of the Switch 2 are outpacing sales of the original Switch in the US</a> by a wide margin, with 2 million units sold as of August 27. Globally, the Switch 2 sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">more than 6 million units in the seven weeks after launch</a>, even with its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/">relatively high price</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
