It recently hit one million signees on its European Citizens' Initiative petition, the minimum amount it needs for the European Commission to officially respond to it. Now, the EU lobbying association Video Games Europe has offered its own statement arguing against the Stop Killing Games movement.</p><p dir="ltr">"We appreciate the passion of our community; however, the decision to discontinue online services is multi-faceted, never taken lightly and must be an option for companies when an online experience is no longer commercially viable," the statement reads on Video Games Europe's <a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/news/statement-on-stop-killing-games/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>. "We understand that it can be disappointing for players but, when it does happen, the industry ensures that players are given fair notice of the prospective changes in compliance with local consumer protection laws.</p>

                <p>After being announced last October, we finally have our first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-rising/news/">Destiny: Rising</a>, as well as a release date. The mobile-exclusive sci-fi RPG shooter set in Bungie's Destiny universe will be released for iOS and Android on August 28, surprising some players who theorized it would be Q1 2026 at the earliest.</p><p>The launch date was announced by Chinese development partner <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20250703/41118_1244957.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NetEase Games</a>, the company behind Marvel Rivals and Diablo Immortal, along with the game's first trailer featuring new gameplay. We catch a glimpse of missions, strikes, PvP battles, and PvE features that players can expect.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3JJKAc-C8Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M3JJKAc-C8Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Destiny: Rising will be set in an "alternate timeline before the events of the original game," meaning players who aren't familiar with the massive lore can jump in without needing to experience previous Destiny titles.</p><p>Players can choose to take on the role of a "fully customizable" Lightbearer named Wolf, but they can also select to play as legendary Destiny characters like Ikora Rey and Iron Lord Jolder. The game features include single, co-op, and competitive multiplayer modes,  Primary and Power Weapons, and the ability to share your loadout across different character arsenals.</p><p>NetEase is also adding a new Mythic-tier rarity for gear, as well as a whole new weapon type. The developer is promising "tons of exciting loot to gather for your characters."</p><p>To get players excited and ready for the game's release, NetEase is holding a <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pre-registration event</a> where people can unlock special bonuses when the game launches. This event unlocks more rewards with each player milestone, which is currently sitting at five million, with the final incentive at 10 million.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In September 2021, a massive leak at Nvidia revealed multiple then-unannounced projects, and as years have passed since the leak, all but one of the leaked titles associated with Square Enix has been officially confirmed. That one is a remake of Final Fantasy IX, which is celebrating its 25th anniversary today--and Square Enix has commemorated the milestone by fueling those remake rumors with a new anniversary video.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/remake-reports-persist-as-square-enix-releases-final-fantasy-9-anniversary-movie/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the minute-long video--set to the iconic song Melodies of Life from the FFIX soundtrack--runs through key moments from the ninth Final Fantasy adventure, with shots of main characters Zidane, Garnet, Vivi, and more peppered throughout. The video ends with new artwork of the team, with the words "Final Fantasy IX 25th Anniversary" included.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFDDlEaUXxw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFDDlEaUXxw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The video has intensified the rumors of a remake which began with the Nvidia leak, with many wondering if the project is still in development. Prominent leaker NateTheHate, in a <a href="https://x.com/Stealth40k/status/1942164160365703368" rel="nofollow ">comment on a ResetEra thread about the video</a>, mentioned that, perhaps, the remake may no longer be coming.</p><p dir="ltr">"As of last check it remains in development, to my knowledge," NateTheHate's <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/square-enix-launches-final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-news-page-on-the-final-fantasy-portal-site.1149465/page-31#post-142366968" rel="nofollow ">comment reads</a>, "but I need to do a fresh check and see what a more current status is--as I did hear a month or so ago that it was in trouble and possibly canceled. I only had one source on the cancellation possibility and need to verify the info further."</p><p dir="ltr">Square Enix has not commented on the rumored project since it was first mentioned in the Nvidia leak. However, of the eight Square Enix games featured in the leak, seven of them have since been announced or released--with the most recent confirmation being<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/"> Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> during the PlayStation State Of Play presentation last month.</p><p dir="ltr">The full list of eight Square Enix games that came from the Nvidia leak were as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Chrono Cross: The Radical Dreamer Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 9 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Kingdom Hearts IV</li><li dir="ltr">"New strategy game" (since revealed as The Diofield Chronicle)</li><li dir="ltr">Tactics Ogre: Reborn</li><li dir="ltr">"Unannounced Card Game 2" (since revealed as Voice Of Cards: The Forsaken Maiden)</li></ul>
