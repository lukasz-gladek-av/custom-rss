                <p>It may seem like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s battle royale is getting all the Star Wars love thanks to the first Star Wars season and battle pass, but this year's annual Fortnite x Star Wars party also has a ton to offer those who play Lego Fortnite--there's a new Lego Pass full of Star Wars builds and the Captain Phasma skin, a big Star Wars festival that's taken over the town in Brick Life, and on May 15, longtime Lego Fortnite players will have the chance to compete against each other in the new Rapid Survival Mode. That's not a <em>small</em> amount of content.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485822"></a><figcaption>Brick Bay is about to get a big makeover.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4485822-legofortnitestarwarsstuff.jpg"></figure><p>The main event here is definitely the Star Wars Festival in Brick Life, which will show up on Friday and stick around until June 7. There's all sorts of stuff to do, from getting a Bantha Burger at the new Durr Burger Cantina to playing space soccer and dueling with lightsabers--not to mention more chill activities like chilling with an adorable little porg.</p><p>To get started, you'll want to visit with the Apprentice Evie NPC, who will give you quests that will show you everything the festival has to offer. And even though the festival only lasts a month, it won't be static--more activities will be added as the festival goes on.</p><p>Over in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, the Star Wars island is returning for May 4th (Star Wars Day) in everyone's world, but that's not the main attraction here. Starting May 15, you'll have the chance to try out the new Rapid Survival mode, in which you compete against other players, via matchmaking, on a fresh, time-limited version of the Star Wars island. You only get four hours to do your thing, progress is dramatically accelerated, PvP is on, and if you're killed the session is over. Rapid Survival itself is also temporary--it's only sticking around until May 26.</p><p>And, of course, there's also the new First Order Lego Pass, which costs 1400 V-Bucks and is included with Fortnite Crew. The big prize here is the Captain Phasma skin, which has a standard version you can take into battle royale in addition to the Lego style. After that, there's a nice pile of new First Order-themed builds in the pass, as well as a jam track and an emote. The First Order Lego Pass is progressed by gaining XP in any Fortnite mode, and will be available until June 7.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Since 2020, Epic Games and Apple have been engaged in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-v-apple-trial-wrap-up-judge-makes-landmark-decision-in-massive-tech-case/1100-6490954/">legal battle</a> over Apple's use of the App Store. The initial ruling came in 2021, and after a bout of appeals, Apple declared "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-declares-resounding-victory-over-epic-games-following-appeals-court-ruling/1100-6513515/">resounding victory</a>" in April 2023. It seems that declaration may have been hasty, as the judge in the case has filed a major injunction against Apple due to "insubordination"--and in celebration, Epic Games has declared that Fortnite will return to iOS in the US next week.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25924283-epic-v-apple-contempt-order/" rel="nofollow ">ruling</a>--which was filed April 30 in a California district court--judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has ruled that Apple can no longer charge commission fees for purchases made outside of the App Store, nor can it block apps from giving users the option to pay outside of the App Store via a standard webpage. Gonzalez Rogers has also referred the case to a US criminal attorney for possible contempt charges, pending review.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"Effective immediately, Apple will no longer impede developers' ability to communicate with users," Gonzalez Rogers says in the ruling, "nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases." Gonzales Rogers also rebuked Apple's "willfully" choosing not to comply with the original 2021 ruling, saying "that [Apple] thought this Court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ruling was released, Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1917716512347152499" rel="nofollow ">announced that Fortnite would return to the US iOS App Store</a> "next week." He also offered Apple what he referred to as a "peace proposal," saying that "if Apple extends the court's friction-free, Apple-tax-free framework worldwide, [Epic will] return Fortnite to the App Store worldwide and drop current and future litigation on the topic."</p><p>Apple has said it will appeal the order in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659310/apple-confirms-it-will-appeal-the-app-store-order" rel="nofollow ">statement to The Verge</a>. "We strongly disagree with the decision," the statement reads. "We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal."</p>

This means an Xbox Series X will now retail for $600 (previously $500) and that select first-party games will start going for $80 this holiday season.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not just Xbox Series X, either. The cheaper Xbox Series S 512GB system will now start at $380 (previously $300), meaning the entry price to this generation is more expensive than when it began in 2020. "We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development," the Xbox support page says revealing the price increases. "Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players."</p><p dir="ltr">Below is a list of the Xbox consoles and accessories changing in price in the US. Microsoft hasn't detailed which games will cost $80 later this year, and Game Pass subscriptions are staying at their current retail price currently.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Xbox Series S 512GB - <strong>$380</strong> (previously $300)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Series S 1TB - <strong>$430</strong> (previously $350)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Series X Digital - <strong>$550</strong> (previously $450)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Series X - <strong>$600</strong> (previously $500)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition - <strong>$730</strong> (previously $600)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Wireless Controller Core - <strong>$65</strong> (previously $60)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Wireless Controller Color - <strong>$70</strong> (previously $65)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Wireless Controller Special Edition - <strong>$80</strong> (previously $70)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Wireless Controller Limited Edition - <strong>$90</strong> (previously $80)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 Core - <strong>$150</strong> (previously $130-$140)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 Full - <strong>$200</strong> (previously $180)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Stereo Headset - <strong>$65</strong> (same price)</li><li dir="ltr">Xbox Wireless Headset - <strong>$120</strong> (previously $110)</li></ul><p>Outside market conditions and development costs, Microsoft is staying rather vague about suddenly raising the prices for so many Xbox products.

Nintendo, however, has stuck to the original $450 price point, for now. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast">Microsoft just did reveal</a> a net income of $25.8 billion for its latest financial quarter, up 18% year over year.</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">surprise launch</a> of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered last week has us all feeling nostalgic about the classic game, including the team who created Oblivion back in 2006. In a new video, Bethesda reunited the original Oblivion team to watch a documentary about the game's creation almost two decades later.</p><p>"This is going to be really f**king awkward watching this," Todd Howard says, before a clip of his younger self plays admitting he was in the chess club in school. For the most part the video is wholesome, with the long-term Bethesda employees reminiscing about a time when the company only had around 40 people on staff--it has around 450 now.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A9oMOem2t4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4A9oMOem2t4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"I remember all the struggles we went through making it," one developer said of the old footage, while others on the team spoke about how ambitious the project was for its time. "I guess I didn't know it at the time, but looking back, we were doing impossible things," another developer added.</p><p>The Oblivion team also discuss how the game was something of a turning point for Bethesda. "It was the 2.0 version of the studio," one dev said. "It is the start of this group of people working together working together, making this great game."</p><p>"It was impossibly hard to do what we wanted to do," Howard adds. Oblivion went on to become a commercial and critical hit for the studio, winning numerous awards and setting the standard for fantasy RPGs for years to come. The recent surprise-release of Oblivion: Remastered has reignited that same fervor in fans, with nostalgia around the remaster running high. The remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-hits-100000-concurrent-players-on-steam-just-hours-after-launch/1100-6531026/" data-ref-id="1100-6531026">hit 100,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam just hours after release, and the numbers have stayed high in the week since.</p><p>Just getting into the remaster?

                <p>With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> set to usher the next big console launch this June, EA founder Trip Hawkins has commented on the future of gaming consoles.</p><p>In a <a href="https://medium.com/@TripHawkins/next-gen-game-platforms-e5d2c4e0c3d9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, Hawkins said he predicts cloud-enabled technologies to dominate going forward, predicting that the days of a "conventional" console selling 150 million units are over.</p><p>"As for the next generation of consoles, we're now in a glide plane where the cloud is everything and it will be far more convenient to have rack-mounted GPUs in data centers than to try to convince the public to buy more consoles, at higher prices, than they have in the past," he said. "We will never see another conventional console sell 150 million units, like the PlayStation 2 did."</p><p>Hawkins went on to say the "technical prowess" of PCs, along with existing current-generation consoles and newer smartphones, might be "good enough" for people.</p><p>"Even for Sony and Microsoft it will soon make more sense to focus on their game-streaming subscription services instead of losing money on hardware manufacturing and marketing," he said. "Brands like PlayStation and Xbox can be maintained yet will also be more easily available on PCs and billions of smart devices, for a win-win among the cloud providers, game brands and players."</p><p>The original Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sold more than 150 million units</a>, and that number is going to climb higher when Nintendo releases its next earnings report this month.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, Hawkins said he expects it to clear 100 million lifetime sales, but given his earlier comments, he doesn't anticipate it reaching the heights of the original Switch.</p><p>Microsoft is working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">next-generation console</a> that could also included a handheld, while Sony is believed to be working on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-powered-by-familiar-chipmaker-report/1100-6526499/" data-ref-id="1100-6526499">PS6</a>. Release dates for both, however, remain unknown.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft is already heavily invested in game-streaming technologies, while Sony allows users to stream games as well. Microsoft has said that game-streaming is just one possible way forward; it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-stresses-that-streaming-won/1100-6479243/" data-ref-id="1100-6479243">continue to release dedicated gaming consoles, too</a>.</p><p>Hawkins left EA all the way back in 1991. Among other things, he was instrumental at EA in signing John Madden to a development deal for what would become the juggernaut Madden football series. A Madden movie is in the works, with John Mulaney set to play Hawkins. The veteran executive recently discussed the film, saying director David O. Russell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-founder-says-madden-moviemakers-had-no-interest-in-involving-him/1100-6531230/" data-ref-id="1100-6531230">declined to work with him.</a></p><p>After EA, Hawkins founded 3DO to create a new gaming console, but it never took off. </p>
