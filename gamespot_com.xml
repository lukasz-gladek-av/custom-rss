                <p>This year marks the 20th anniversary of MLB The Show, and to celebrate, MLB The Show 25 has three players on its cover for the first time--Pirates pitcher Paul Skenes, Reds shortstop Elly De La Cruz, and Orioles shortstop Gunnar Henderson.

                <p>MLB The Show 25 will be out this March, and as the first game in years to not release on day one for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mlb-the-show-25-launches-in-march-but-wont-be-on-game-pass-this-year/1100-6529072/" data-ref-id="1100-6529072">Game Pass</a>, Sony's San Diego Studio had to make the case for you to spend your money at launch. New features coming to the game this year might just do that, with the sometimes-stagnant Road to the Show mode getting a big upgrade and Diamond Dynasty ditching a system players took issue with.</p><p>Rather than complete a simple combine exercise before getting drafted by an MLB team, this year's Road to the Show mode will let you begin your career as a high-school player before making the jump to college and the pros.</p><p>Authentic amateur-level audio has been included specifically for this, such as the loud "ping" of aluminum bats and the distinct crash of a player hitting a chain-link fence. Elsewhere, "hundreds" of new gameplay animations have been added, along with a new G.O.A.T. difficulty setting and an "ambush hitting" system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G33itOzDkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0G33itOzDkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Road to the Show's progression system has also been overhauled, which Sony says gives you "more control over your player's development, including crafting Perks to your liking." With any luck, it should help your players from falling too neatly into one of a few different archetypes, as they could in years past.</p><p>Diamond Dynasty has also gotten some big changes. The Sets and Seasons system, which limited the players you could take into an online ranked match, have been removed. A new tabletop-like Diamond Quest mode and the multiplayer Weekend Classic have also been added, giving you another way to earn rewards.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, MLB The Show 25 sees the return of Storylines with The Negro Leagues Season 3. Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick is back to showcase some of the greatest baseball players of all time in an educational mode that always features some unique game situations.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 releases on March 18 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch. Preorders are live now.</p>

                <p>The lead writer of the beloved RPG Fallout: New Vegas has returned to Obsidian, but those who are hoping to see a hypothetical New Vegas 2 are going to be disappointed. On his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrgonzalez/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn profile</a>, John Gonzalez posted that he's returned to Obsidian Entertainment in a new role as creative director. Under the entry for this job, he wrote the following: "Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)"</p><p dir="ltr">Gonzalez is arguably best-known as one of the lead writers of New Vegas, but he's contributed to a number of other projects. As his LinkedIn shows, he served as narrative director on Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West at Guerrilla Games. He also worked on Tom Clancy's EndWar at Ubisoft and contributed lead narrative to Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Gonzalez is also working on a novel titled "God Mode: Single Player," which he describes as "the ultimate video game novel."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's unclear what Gonzalez is working on at Obsidian, the studio has two currently announced projects. One is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to one of the studio's biggest games, known for its signature sense of humor. The other is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-avowed-is-like-skyrim-plus-one-of-the-last-decades-best-sci-fi-movies/1100-6526088/" data-ref-id="1100-6526088">Avowed</a>, a new RPG set in the world of the studio's previous Pillars of Eternity games. Avowed releases on February 18, 2025, while The Outer Worlds 2 is set to come out sometime in 2025.</p>
