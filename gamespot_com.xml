                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/schedule-i/" data-ref-id="5000-640596">Schedule 1</a> is one of this year's biggest surprise hits among the indie crowd, especially since it's a life-sim game about building up your own drug empire. But if the game's subject matter kept it from being sold on Steam, Schedule 1 creator Tyler was going to pivot and make into a farming sim.</p><p>"Early during development, I had a plan where, if Steam wouldn't take it for whatever reason, I could just pivot it to be a farming game," Tyler told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/creator-of-drug-lord-hit-schedule-1-had-a-backup-plan-so-that-if-steam-wouldnt-take-it-for-whatever-reason-i-could-just-pivot-it-to-be-a-farming-game-and-strip-all-the-drug-stuff-out/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "Just strip all the drug stuff out, make it a farming game--but thankfully, it was all right."</p><p>Tyler went on to note that a few other countries "don't love it," including his native Australia.</p><p>"We were effectively banned in Australia, which kind of sucked, but we got it there in the end," recalled Tyler.</p><p>Schedule 1 may remind some players of Breaking Bad, as the main character moves into a new city and slowly begins to expand their drug dealing operations. Players can grow cannabis in the game, but only in support of selling and distributing it. It's also possible to cook meth while avoiding unwanted attention from the police and rival dealers.</p><p>Although the game is still in early access, Schedule 1 recently added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-schedule-1-update-adds-rival-cartel-wars/1100-6534328/" data-ref-id="1100-6534328">cartel wars</a> to its features. TVGS has also invited players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vote-now-to-choose-schedule-1s-next-big-feature/1100-6534499/" data-ref-id="1100-6534499">vote about which feature</a> will be added to the game next.</p><p>The impact of not getting Steam approval was recently shown when the developers of Horses shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-indie-game-has-been-banned-on-steam-before-its-even-released/1100-6536488/" data-ref-id="1100-6536488">message about the studio's potential closure</a> because of that decision and their inability to make an appeal to Valve.</p>

                <p>After previously working with Bandai Namco's studio in Singapore on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splatoon-3/" data-ref-id="5000-527230">Splatoon 3</a>, Nintendo has revealed that a deal has been struck to bring that developer in-house.</p><p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/251127.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made the announcement</a> online, which notes that it will own 80% of Bandai Namco Studios Singapore by April 2026 per its agreement with Bandai Namco. The remaining 20% the Singapore studio will be purchased at a later date, "once the subsidiary's operations have stabilized."</p><p>The new name of the studio will be Nintendo Studios Singapore. Nintendo also noted that the studio was chosen for acquisition because it "has an ongoing business relationship with Nintendo" and the publisher wanted to "strengthen" its internal development structure.</p><p>Bandai Namco Studios Singapore's collaborations with Nintendo included Mario Sports Superstars and New Pokemon Snap. It's also rumored to have been involved with Bandai Namco's version of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4</a>, before the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/" data-ref-id="1100-6464593">completely redeveloped by Retro Studios</a> in 2019.</p><p>This deal doesn't appear to mean Bandai Namco is putting itself up for sale. Earlier this year, Bandai Namco struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">a $463 million deal with Sony</a> for approximately 2.5% of the company. Bandai Namco retains some of the biggest franchises in gaming, including Elden Ring, Tekken, and Pac-Man. However, the company has disclosed that a former employee allegedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-former-bandai-namco-employee-allegedly-embezzled-so-much-money-execs-had-to-take-a-pay-cut/1100-6533562/" data-ref-id="1100-6533562">embezzled so much money from Bandai Namco</a> that its executives have taken a pay cut.</p>

Out of all of Lego's gaming system sets, Pac-Man Arcade is probably the most impressive from a design perspective. And it's definitely the coolest when it comes to interactive features. It has a movable four-way joystick, and you can press the two dome buttons. The crank on the side of the cabinet moves Pac-Man through the mechanical maze while Blinky and Clyde chase him.</p><p>The coin slot uses a light brick that makes it look like the real thing. In addition to the cabinet itself, it comes with buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures that attach to a stand that connects to the top of the cabinet.</p><p>Rounding out the set is a minifigure-scale '80s arcade scene, complete with a tiny brick-built Pac-Man cabinet and a gamer minifigure wearing vintage clothes. You can store the scene inside the cabinet by removing the back panel. This also allows you to watch the mechanical components in motion while turning the crank.</p></div>                      </div><h2>Amazon Black Friday Sale: Best Lego Deals (Nov. 28)</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DRW6VY43?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Battle Droid with STAP (1,088 pieces)</a> -- $90 (<del>$140</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Anniversary-Collectible/dp/B0CGYH4VG8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Tantive IV (654 pieces)</a> -- $40 (<del>$80</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Star-Wars-Collectible-Anniversary/dp/B0CGY4QJTC?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Star Wars: Boarding the Tantive IV (502 pieces)</a> -- $38.49 (<del>$55</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 pieces)</a> -- $189 (<del>$270</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Technic-Champions-McLaren-Exciting/dp/B0CX2Z2Z4K?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Technic &amp;
