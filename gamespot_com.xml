There's also an upcoming Black Ops Tribute event that lets you unlock a new operator skin hilariously called John Black Ops. Here's how you can get this new free operator skin for Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch is paying tribute to the Black Ops series with a new event that launches next month. The Black Ops Tribute event runs from April 17 to May 1, and it includes 17 rewards themed around the series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4466846-bo6-season-03-announcement-047b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466846" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4466846-bo6-season-03-announcement-047b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4466846"></a><figcaption>John Black Ops operator skin</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4466846-bo6-season-03-announcement-047b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of these event rewards is an operator skin for someone who is mysteriously dressed in an all-gray jumpsuit with tactical goggles and a helmet, as seen in the image above. This operator is simply named John Black Ops, and Activision describes this new character as "Anonymous. Unassuming. Deadly."</p><p dir="ltr">The Black Ops Tribute event is one of Call of Duty's XP-based events, so you'll just need to play and grind XP in order to unlock John and all the other rewards. This XP can be earned by playing any modes across multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">For more news, make sure to check out all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-season-3-adds-iconic-mp-map-new-zombies-plus-jay-and-silent-bob/2900-6380/#1">highlights for Season 3 of Black Ops 6</a>, which showcase the new Shattered Veil Zombies map, new multiplayer maps, and Jay and Silent Bob operator bundles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-season-3-roadmap-highlights-verdansk-event-omnimovement-changes-and-bots/2900-6375/">Warzone's Season 3 content is showcased here</a>, including the classic features and vehicles returning with Verdansk. </p><p dir="ltr">Verdansk was rebuilt from the ground up with new technology, and Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-warzone-heres-what-verdansk-looks-like-for-season-3/2900-6376/" data-ref-id="2900-6376">side-by-side comparison of Verdansk's map changes</a> can be viewed in the images below.

                <p>System Shock 3 has been in development hell since 2015, but Nightdive Studio is hoping to give fans some news about the game soon.</p><p>At GDC, Nightdive director of business development Larry Kuperman said that the situation surrounding System Shock 3 is complicated and that he didn't have any updates yet. "Not as yet, not as yet. I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year," he explained (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "It could be, or it could take longer. That said, what I can say is that we have visions of what we can do within what we control."</p><p>He also said that while System Shock 2's remaster is releasing soon, that doesn't mean that Nightdive won't do a remake. While it's unclear what the franchise's future holds after the release of the System Shock 2 remaster, he said that there were other actions the studio could take with both the first and second games. After all, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-tv-show-in-the-works/1100-6497025/" data-ref-id="1100-6497025">System Shock TV show</a> is currently in the works.</p><p>System Shock 3 was last in development over at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-3s-future-remains-vague-as-otherside-/1100-6476246/" data-ref-id="1100-6476246">OtherSide</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-3-is-moving-forward-with-tencents-inv/1100-6477539/" data-ref-id="1100-6477539">Tencent took over</a> its development as well as the entire franchise in 2020. Nightdive still has the rights to the first two System Shock games.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-2s-long-awaited-nightdive-studios-remaster-has-a-new-name/1100-6529509/" data-ref-id="1100-6529509">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> is set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on June 26. It features newly enhanced character and weapon models, adjustable field of view, and widescreen support.</p>

                <p>Amazon Luna+, the game-streaming platform run by the online retail giant, is adding a trio of high-profile games from Electronic Arts. Amazon has <a href="https://amazonluna.blog/amazon-luna-signs-multi-year-content-deal-with-electronic-arts-and-expands-to-sweden-portugal-152881cdd355" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that it's reached a multi-year deal with EA to bring "many" of its games to Luna+, and this begins with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and 2023's Dead Space. These three games join Luna today, while more are coming to Luna "soon."</p><p>EA executive David Tinson said it partnered with Amazon in part to help its games reach an even bigger audience. Amazon teased that some of the upcoming EA titles to join the Luna catalog will include EA Sports games, though no titles were named outright.</p><p>Luna+ is not part of Amazon Prime but is instead an additional $10/month subscription (after a free seven-day trial). The subscription service has more than 100 games in the catalog already, including Batman: Arkham Knight, Sonic Frontiers, Resident Evil 2, Control, Alien: Isolation, and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga. These games are playable over the cloud on a variety of devices, including Amazon's own TVs and tablets, as well as smartphones and PC.</p><p>Luna is one of many cloud-streaming services in gaming today, sitting alongside Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming and Nvidia's GeForce Now. Some EA games are also streaming on Xbox Cloud Gaming, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-adds-cfb-25-today-but-only-for-ultimate-subscribers/1100-6530430/" data-ref-id="1100-6530430">including College Football 25. </a></p><p>The appeal of such services is that users do not need a beefy PC or high-end console because games are streamed. However, a good cloud-gaming experience requires a consistent and powerful connection.</p><p>Amazon created its own Luna controller, too, and it's on sale now for $45 (down from $70). Luna is also compatible with a controller you may already own, including Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch controllers.</p><p>Amazon also confirmed that Luna is now available in more places, including Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg. This brings the total number of supported countries to 14 worldwide. The other supported countries for Luna are the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Poland, and the Netherlands.</p>
