                <p>Robert Francis Prevost, who just became Pope Leo XIV, is just like you and me: He plays video games.</p><p>His brother, John Prevost, told NBC Chicago that he and Robert recently played games like Wordle and Words with Friends to help take his mind off the decision about whether or not he would be elected the new pope. He didn't have to wait long, though, as Prevost was named the new pope on the second day of the conclave.</p><p>John also revealed that his brother just recently watched the 2024 movie Conclave, which tells the story of the appointment of a new pope.</p><p>"I wanted to take his mind off of it--laugh about something--because this is now an awesome responsibility," John said of his brother becoming the new pope.</p><p>Robert Prevost didn't play any video games during conclave, however, as all cardinals had to surrender their phones before voting at the Sistine Chapel earlier this week for who would become the new pope.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbnZ8zz9_og" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tbnZ8zz9_og" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pope Francis passed away on Easter Monday this year at the age of 88. He had been pope since 2013.

He was born in Chicago and is a White Sox fan, even <a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/2025/05/08/pope-leo-xiv-robert-prevost-st-rita-high-school-chicago" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">attending the World Series in 2005.</a></p>

                <p>The item shop in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a> will look significantly different the next time you log in to Valve's third-person MOBA. The developer has overhauled the shop, adding new items, icons, costs, and more. Despite the patch notes saying that the major update is "coming soon," it's already live in-game.</p><p>Item slots were previously tied to specific tree types, but they will now be universal. Item-specific slots being replaced with universal slots removes the problem of some heroes feeling weaker due to needing up to six items of a particular kind to efficiently launch a counterattack after falling behind. Formerly, you had the ability to unlock four flex slots which served the same purpose. With the total slot count being reduced from 16 to 12, we can assume these flex slots are no longer available for unlock.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4491115-deadlockshopreworkfirstlook%21%21newitems%2Cbuilds%2Cheroredesigns%2Candmore%210-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491115" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4491115-deadlockshopreworkfirstlook%21%21newitems%2Cbuilds%2Cheroredesigns%2Candmore%210-41screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491115"></a><figcaption>The new item shop interface</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4491115-deadlockshopreworkfirstlook%21%21newitems%2Cbuilds%2Cheroredesigns%2Candmore%210-41screenshot.png"></figure><p>There are "many" new items being added to the store according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422450/view/524216645064852902" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, and all item icons have got new artwork which makes the items and their purpose more easily identifiable.</p><p>Tier bonuses will also see a rework and will no longer be based on each item you buy. Instead, bonuses are based on your total spend in that item tree. It's important to note that bonuses are not linear though, so fully completing one tree isn't optimal in terms of the bonuses you'll receive.</p><p>If you're curious about whether you can or can't buy a specific upgrade, those items will now glow if an upgrade is available.</p><p>While it's well-known that the closed alpha test is invite only, it was recently discovered that there's an even more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valves-deadlock-has-a-super-secret-invite-only-alpha-different-from-the-known-invite-only-alpha/1100-6531294/" data-ref-id="1100-6531294">hidden test version</a>, as a streamer accidentally launched the wrong version of the game in front of his viewers.</p>
