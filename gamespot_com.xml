                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A small update has arrived to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a> And <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking. Now, any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time. Accounts that fail to complete this step will be locked from use on the PC platform until the security check is completed.

This includes the white-screen bug that prevented some players from completing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/shattered-veil-story-easter-egg-guide-for-call-of-duty-black-ops-6/2900-6418/">main story quest for Shattered Veil</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For Warzone, the update makes changes to the game's ground loot. The DM-10 marksman rifle, Tsarkov marksman rifle, and the SVD sniper rifle are removed from supply boxes and ground loot.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for both <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><h2>GLOBAL</h2><h3>Ricochet Anti-Cheat</h3><p>We’ve rolled out changes to account linking as described <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">in a blog from #TeamRicochet</a> ahead of Season 03.</p><p>These changes will provide additional security to players with multiple platforms linked to their ATVI ID.</p><p>Account Linking Update</p><ul><li>Any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time.</li><li>Not completing this verification check will lock the account from use on the PC platform only until completed.</li><li>Read more <a href="http://callofduty.com/blog/2025/03/call-of-duty-ricochet-black-ops-6-warzone-season-three-anti-cheat-update#linking" rel="nofollow ">about this policy change here</a>, and visit <a href="https://support.activision.com/articles/keeping-your-activision-account-secure" rel="nofollow ">Keeping your Activision Account Secure</a> periodically for account security best practices.</li></ul><p>From the Ricochet Blog on 3/28:</p><p>Account Linking Changes</p><p>In a proactive effort to protect our players, we’re adjusting account linking shortly after the launch of Season 03. Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform. Players will see an in-game notification if this occurs, locking gameplay on the new platform until the authentication has been completed.</p><p>If you receive an email notification about a platform link or login attempt you did not initiate, visit CallofDuty.com to login and immediately unlink the account and update your password.</p><p>Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites. Reusing passwords on other apps or websites in connection with your email can open the door to your account being stolen or hijacked.

"[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys.
