                <p>The next WoW Remix event is coming, and this time it's fan-favorite expansion Legion in the spotlight. The upcoming Legion Remix event had already been teased by Blizzard, but it was officially announced at the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2454299911?t=7h16m54s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evolving Azeroth panel</a> at PAX East over the weekend.</p><p>World of Warcraft associate game director Jeremy Feasel officially announced the new Remix event, as picked up by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/legion-remix-officially-announced-at-pax-east-mythic-and-shattered-timeline-376808?utm_source=discord-webhook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, and shared some insight into the ongoing process of remixing Legion.</p><p>"Legion has a lot of content--way more content than Mists of Pandaria--and it has a huge amount of different systems," he reminded fans. "The team is currently hard at work delving deep into 'how we are going to integrate all these systems in a remixed way. Which systems are we gonna remix? Which systems are we gonna remix and add new things to?'"</p><p>The extra complexity in Legion means we don't have many details or even a release date for Legion Remix yet, but Feasel did share a few tidbits on what fans can expect. First in line to get the Remix treatment are Mythic Keystones, which were first introduced to WoW in the Legion expansion.</p><p>"Hey, wouldn't it be cool if you could do Mythic Keystones with the wild item scaling of Remix, and see how high you can go? We think that would be cool. We're really excited about folks getting a chance to do that and just figuring out how to completely break that game," Feasel said, adding that he fully expects players to break the game with the remixed Mythics--and have a lot of fun doing it.</p><p>The second feature of Legion Remix that Feasel announced on the panel was the addition of a new increased-difficulty world tier called the Shattered Timeline. "It's a timeline where everything went worse, and everybody is significantly more difficult," Feasel explained, adding that the addition of world tiers was heavily inspired by the Diablo team.</p><p>WoW's first Remix event was Mists of Pandaria, which dropped around this time last year. The event, which saw players power-levelling through Pandaria and picking up powerful new gear and items, was a hit with fans, leaving players speculating what other expansions would be up for the Remix treatment next.</p>
