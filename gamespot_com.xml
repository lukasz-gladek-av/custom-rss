                <p>Road to the Show is one of the most popular game modes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mlb-the-show-25/" data-ref-id="5000-660215">MLB The Show 25</a>. The mode allows you to create your own player and ascend the ranks of Major League Baseball to eventually reach the big leagues and make a true name for yourself. There are plenty of different factors that go into making it to the Show, and your player's batting stance can be one of them.</p><p>While it might not sound like a major factor, some players die on the hill that your batting stance can make a huge difference at the plate. Whether it's due to timing, the look of the swing, or the starting position of the bat, a particular batting stance can be considered "better" than others.</p><p>To help you narrow down your choices from the hundreds of batting stances in MLB The Show 25, we've listed our top seven stances and why you should use them. <strong>The list is in no particular order</strong>.</p><h2>Yordan Alvarez (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461472"></a><figcaption>Yordan Alvarez</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461472-img_6467.jpg"></figure><p>We're starting with one of the more famous batting stances from the past few years in MLB The Show. Yordan Alvarez of the Houston Astros has become one of the best hitters in baseball and many Road to the Show players have stood by his batting stance since he started to mash balls all over the league. Alvarez's stance puts the bat on your left shoulder and keeps your elbows fairly even. However, if you want to take the stance to the next level, you can customize the "Forward Foot Offset" to the following:</p><ul><li>Offset Z: 0</li><li>Offset X: 0</li></ul><p>These settings make your right foot extend way out away from your body, placing more weight on your back foot. While the stance might look a little funky, it delivers a huge leg kick and some true power behind each swing.</p><h2>Shawn Green (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461473"></a><figcaption>Shawn Green</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461473-img_6466.jpg"></figure><p>We can't take credit for this entry, as the stance and its settings <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MLBTheShow/comments/1e0eyhd/comment/lco7jhc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">come from a Redditor</a> on the MLB The Show subreddit. However, we felt it had to be included due to how many players have sung its praises over the years. The stance is for Shawn Green, foundational speaking, but it customizes a variety of settings to make it one-of-a-kind in Road to the Show.</p><p>Here are the custom stance settings you should use for Shawn Green:</p><ul><li>Hand Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 48</li><li>Offset Y: 70</li><li>Offset Z: 61</li></ul></li><li>Hand Rotation: 60</li><li>Hand Waggle Rotation: 80</li><li>Back Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Front Elbow Offset: 50</li><li>Hips Offset:  <ul><li>Offset X: 77</li><li>Offset Y: 65</li><li>Offset Z: 48</li></ul></li><li>Front Foot Offset:  <ul><li>Offset Z: 48</li><li>Offset X: 33</li></ul></li></ul><p>Using these custom settings, you create a balanced stance that many Road to the Show players simply call "the one."</p><h2>Mark McGwire (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461474"></a><figcaption>Mark McGwire</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461474-img_6465.jpg"></figure><p>Mark McGwire, with or without the steroids, is one of the best hitters the MLB has ever seen. McGwire utilized a couple of abnormal batting stances during his career, but the first one he utilized is one of the best available in Road to the Show. You can also use a second McGwire stance (1987) that features hands tighter to the batter's face.</p><p>The base McGwire stance is simple, doesn't have a lot of movement, and has feet that are fairly far apart from one another. It delivers great timing and has a fluid swing that works for both lefties and righties.</p><h2>Chipper Jones 2008 (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461475"></a><figcaption>Chipper Jones</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461475-img_6464.jpg"></figure><p>Chipper Jones is the most successful switch hitter of all time in the MLB, and his 2008 batting stance is highly recommended for any Road to the Show player who takes up the switch-hitting mantle. Chipper's swing also looks better on taller players, as it's relaxed and makes you stand almost fully upright. The bat is close to resting on your shoulder with little movement, the elbows are even with each other around the chest area, and both feet are pretty close together.</p><p>If you're a switch hitter or want a fully relaxed batting stance, take a look at Chipper Jones' stance.</p><h2>Yoan Moncada (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461476"></a><figcaption>Yoan Moncada</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461476-img_6463.jpg"></figure><p>Yoan Moncada's MLB career hasn't worked out like many thought it would, but his stance is great for power hitters. It looks similar to Chipper Jones' stance, but features hands closer to your face and looks a little more focused towards the pitcher. Many Road to the Show players have suggested messing with the custom settings to make Moncada's feet farther apart, but the upright look works well for the stance, in our opinion.</p><h2>Ken Griffey Jr. (former player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461477"></a><figcaption>Ken Griffey Jr.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461477-img_6462.jpg"></figure><p>Ken Griffey Jr. is one of the most recognizable baseball players in history and he was known to have arguably the smoothest swing of all time. That holds up in MLB The Show 25, as Griffey's default stance is great for both contact and power hitters as well as both sides of the plate. The stance looks pretty normal but the swing drives through the middle of the plate and the bat ends up right behind the batter with one hand up in the air.</p><h2>Freddie Freeman (current player)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4461479"></a><figcaption>Freddie Freeman</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4461479-img_6461.jpg"></figure><p>Rounding out the list is the current reigning World Series MVP, Freddie Freeman. Freeman has always had a smooth swing, but it's one that works best for lefties in MLB The Show 25. The stance is designed to pull the ball and pull-hitters usually hit from the left side of the plate.</p><p>It places the bat behind the batter's head with the back elbow up a little farther than the front one, which is close to the batter's face. The right knee is slightly bent to place a little more weight on the left leg so you can really drive the ball into right field. Even if you're a right-handed hitter, though, don't feel like you can't use Freeman's stance.</p><p>And that does it for our top batting stances in MLB The Show 25. Of course, these are just our suggestions, so you can try them to find your preference.</p>

                <p>After paying college athletes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">$600 to appear in College Football 25</a>, EA will pay players more than double that for this year's CFB 26. EA Sports confirmed to FBS players in an email today, obtained by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, stating that players will get $1,500 if they opt in to appear in this year's game. This is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">this information leaked earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Additionally, players will receive a Deluxe Edition copy of the game--this was also offered in 2025. EA will pay some athletes more for appearing as brand ambassadors, just like last year.</p><p>A spokesperson for EA said, "College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in College Football 26 and beyond."</p><p>More than 11,000 student-athletes appeared in CFB 25 through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals, with EA spending more than $6 million to cover that. A spokesperson told The Athletic that EA will double its payment to players to more than $16.5 million to help them feel recognized for the success of CFB 25. Of note, the $16.5 million figure reportedly does not include any further payments to certain players who have ambassador deals or for further payments to cover athletes. </p><p>That game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game of 2024 overall in the US</a>, only surpassed by Black Ops 6. CFB 25 was the <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/12/18/Unpacks/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-video-game-all-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">best-selling sports video game in US history based on dollar sales.</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/FOS/status/1902076294780624967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Front Office Sports</a>, EA is also potentially going to negotiate royalty-based payments for certain players on top of the $1,500 appearance fee.</p><p>CFB 26 is in the works now and is expected to launch in July. EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p>
