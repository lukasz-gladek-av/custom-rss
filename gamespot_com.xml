                <p>Sony's Inzone PC gaming collection is branching beyond headsets and monitors with its next batch of releases. Most notably, Sony is entering the gaming keyboard and mouse scene with competitive-focused options made in collaboration with esports team Fnatic. Like all products in the series so far, the Inzone KBD-H75 Wired Gaming Keyboard ($300) and the wireless Inzone Mouse-A ($150) are built with high-end components and carry premium prices.</p><p>Sony is also releasing a new flagship Inzone H9 II wireless gaming headset with ANC and audio drivers based on its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new WH-1000XM6 headphones</a>. Perhaps the most niche addition to the series is the Inzone E9, a pair of wired $150 earbuds. Preorders for all of the new Sony Inzone peripherals open today at Amazon, Best Buy, and Sony. Take a look at all of the upcoming gear below.

This time around, that's the recently released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM6-Headphones-Microphones-Studio-Quality/dp/B0F3PQHWTZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WH-1000XM6 headphones</a>, which retail for $450. Sony's Inzone H9 and the Inzone Buds have the best noise-canceling features we've tried in gaming-focused audio gear, and the H9 II should be even better with ANC while also offering improved positional audio. The leatherette ear cushions should also be similar to the XM6, just with a fuller form factor.</p><p>The H9 II has a detachable cardioid boom mic with ambient noise-filtering tech and a Super Wide Band mic. The H9 II supports 2.4GHz Wireless (USB-C adapter) and Bluetooth, including simultaneous connections on multiple devices, with up to 30 hours of battery life. The H9 II comes with a soft carrying pouch.</p><p>Another notable difference between the H9 II and its predecessor is the headband design, which looks similar to what SteelSeries does with its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova headsets</a>--the most comfortable gaming headsets around.</p><p>The Inzone H9 II will be available in white/black and an all-black color scheme at launch, matching the current lineup of Inzone headsets.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony Inzone E9 In-Ear Monitor (Wired Gaming Earbuds)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+E9+In-Ear+Monitor+%28Wired+Gaming+Earbuds%29&amp;crid=BE4XNWZMDJ2E&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+e9+in-ear+monitor+wired+gaming+earbuds+%2Caps%2C156&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Sony calls the Inzone E9 an In-Ear Monitor for gaming, but yes, that's just fancy wording for earbuds. The E9 comes with two different styles of eartips and multiple sizes for each. The foam eartips are designed to isolate noise, and then there are also more traditional silicone eartips.</p><p>Sony says the E9 earbuds are its first "fully enclosed structure," which is intended to help with isolating specific sounds. The earbuds support virtual 7.1 surround sound and Sony's 360 spatial sound. Each pair of E9 gaming earbuds comes with the carrying case shown above.</p><p>Since the E9 earbuds connect via 3.5mm audio, you could use them on basically all of your gaming platforms and devices, but the Inzone Hub customization suite only works on PC, as does some of Sony's audio features.</p><p>This isn't Sony's first pair of gaming earbuds. Sony previously released a pair of noise-canceling wireless earbuds for PC and PlayStation consoles called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJH6NV38?ie=UTF8&amp;smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone Buds</a>. We'd highly recommend the Inzone Buds for PC and PlayStation as well as mobile devices with USB-C--the Inzone Buds are limited to Bluetooth LE, so you need to use the dongle for most mobile devices. Sony raised the price of the Inzone Buds from $200 to $230 earlier this year, but you can grab a pair for $198 at Amazon. The Inzone Buds have ANC, whereas the E9 earbuds have noise isolation features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Sony Inzone Gaming Desk Mats</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Sony+Inzone+Desk+Mat&amp;crid=5M4LT083CEHY&amp;sprefix=sony+inzone+desk+mat%2Caps%2C99&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">Mat-F: $60 | Mat-D: $35</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>To go along with its new keyboard and mouse, Sony is adding a pair of mouse pads to its Inzone lineup.

                <p>This year, games that were previously Xbox-exclusive properties have been migrating to PS5, including the upcoming Gears of War remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War Reloaded</a>. Just under two decades ago, the original Gears of War was one of Xbox's signature titles. Now, the co-creator of the franchise, Cliff Bleszinski, has shared his thoughts about seeing Gears of War appear on a PlayStation console.</p><p>"It doesn't feel strange," said Bleszinski during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-grand-direct-unveiling-was-classic-sakurai-as-he-jokes-its-not-another-mario-kart-clone" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>Bleszinski also noted that he's interested in returning to the series as a consultant, but "crickets" has been the response from the devs. Although Bleszinski left the Gears franchise years ago, he has shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-needs-a-god-of-war-like-reboot-creator-says/1100-6518779/" data-ref-id="1100-6518779">his belief that the franchise should be rebooted</a>. Bleszinski has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-creator-discusses-his-alien-game-pitch-and-what-went-wrong/1100-6518780/" data-ref-id="1100-6518780">he pitched an Alien game</a> prior to Disney's purchase of Fox.</p><p>Gears of War Reloaded is the second remaster of the original game from 2006. All of the post-launch content from the game's first remaster, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, will be included. Microsoft has sent free upgrades for Reloaded to anyone who already has Gears of War: Ultimate Edition.</p><p>Microsoft will drop Gears of War Reloaded on August 28 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Cross-platform play and cross-progression will be supported. It will be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-august-include-gears-of-war-remaster-and-chaotic-goats/2900-6892/" data-ref-id="2900-6892">Game Pass</a> at launch. Microsoft has yet to confirm that the next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, will be cross-platform when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">launches in 2026 as part of Xbox's 25th anniversary.</a></p>

                <p>DC games haven't had the best of times in recent years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301">marked by a string of missteps</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">canceled projects</a>. While titles like the Batman: Arkham series found success, much of the broader DC gaming output has lacked consistency. This is something James Gunn wants to remedy as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dc-studios-announces-10-new-movies-and-tv-shows-prepare-for-chapter-1-gods-monsters/1100-6511036/" data-ref-id="1100-6511036">10-year plan as co-head of DC Studios</a>.</p><p>When the rebooted DCU launched in 2023, Gunn emphasized cross-platform storytelling, noting that actors would portray their characters "across all forms of media--including video games." While there has been little public movement since then, Gunn recently confirmed that there is "slight movement on different things." That could mean we're headed toward a future where David Corenswet voices Superman in both film and other media, although Gunn didn't discuss specifics concerning Corenswet or anyone else.</p><p>“We have a couple of little DC games coming out. But we also have talked about--and in early stages of planning--some bigger things," Gunn told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/dc-tv-shows/after-years-of-silence-dc-boss-james-gunn-teases-dcus-gaming-plans-theres-one-thing-in-particular-im-excited-about-but-it-does-take-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>. "One thing in particular I'm excited about, but it does take time."</p><p>Both Gunn and Peter Safran are taking a proactive role in shaping DC's gaming future. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-dc-universe-game-wont-be-revealed-soon-but-some-really-interesting-projects-are-coming/1100-6529678/" data-ref-id="1100-6529678">Back in February</a>, Safran gave an outlook on how they're trying to course-correct the situation and give fans must-play games again.</p><p>"James and I sit with literally the guys that run the studios…whether it's NetherRealm or whether it's Rocksteady, sit with them and talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in," Safran shared.</p><p>Gunn also admitted then that any major release is "at least a couple of years" away, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-batman-and-game-of-thrones-games-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6529314/">Rocksteady is said to be returning to its single-player Batman roots for its next project</a>, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warner-bros-boss-says-it-has-the-best-cookies-talks-about-milking-them/1100-6526460/">WB Games is now focusing its efforts and resources on its biggest franchises</a>.</p>
