                <p dir="ltr">1047 Games gave players another peek at its upcoming free-to-play FPS, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate-2/">Splitgate 2</a>, at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The new gameplay trailer provides a closer look at the lightning-paced shooter's maps and environments, which have a bit more stylistic flair than their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/splitgate/">original Splitgate</a> predecessors. Players can be seen portal-ing their way through a variety of environments during the one-minute trailer, from frozen snowscapes and sci-fi sports arenas to suburban streets dotted with sakura trees.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zncj59QzZIM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zncj59QzZIM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Splitgate 2 takes place in a future where everyone's favorite sport is, well, Splitgate. Players pick from a roster of characters who live for the game and have exclusive abilities, battling it out to bring glory to one of three factions: Aeros, Meridian, or Sabrask.</p><p dir="ltr">Though brief, the new gameplay footage does include a little treat for eagle-eyed players. Near the trailer's conclusion, a shot of a snowy map with a holographic "Zone Active" sign can be seen. Moments later, members of the Aeros faction can be seen proudly planting their flag on a mountaintop. According to the game's developers, this blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment is a nod to a new mode that will be revealed during the Splitgate 2's next alpha test, which is scheduled for early 2025.</p><p>1047 Games has yet to announce an official release date for Splitgate 2, but have confirmed that it will launch on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, and PC sometime in 2025. Splitgate 2 is currently available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/" rel="nofollow ">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>
