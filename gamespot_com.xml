                <p>Saints Row developer Volition, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/" data-ref-id="1100-6517393">which shuttered in 2023</a>, was developing a Harry Potter game, or at least a pitch for one, and now the first details and images from the project have emerged.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-zillion-years-before-hogwarts-legacy-pre-saints-row-volition-was-making-a-baldurs-gate-style-harry-potter-rpg-and-its-never-been-seen-by-the-public-before/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> learned about the game and saw images of it at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York recently. The report said developers at Volition, having been big fans of the books, assembled a demo for a Harry Potter game in 1999. This was before the first movie came out in 2001, so the developers created their own ideas for what some of the characters might look like. It's also worth mentioning that Volition at the time was known as Parallax Software Corporation.</p><p>The demo included a sequence where Hagrid and Harry Potter are walking around a cobblestone area, with players able to switch between both characters in a top-down RPG setup. The demo doesn't include much in the way of activities, and that's because, Strong Museum's Andrew Borman said, Volition made it in a couple of weeks to pitch to the rights-holders. You can <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-zillion-years-before-hogwarts-legacy-pre-saints-row-volition-was-making-a-baldurs-gate-style-harry-potter-rpg-and-its-never-been-seen-by-the-public-before/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">see images of the game at GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Borman said executives from the game developer and publisher attended a pitch meeting in which at least some of the top bosses "came dressed in robes and had owls with them" in an apparent bid to help win the rights.</p><p>Volition's pitch was not successful, and Electronic Arts ultimately won the Harry Potter gaming rights, releasing numerous movie tie-ins over the years.</p><p>The newest Harry Potter game is Hogwarts Legacy, which launched in 2023 to great success. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-20-best-selling-games-of-2023-in-the-us/2900-4951/" data-ref-id="2900-4951">the year's best-selling game overall</a>, even outselling the new Call of Duty game that year. 2024's Quidditch Champions game was less successful, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-gets-unexpected-update-connection-to-upcoming-show/1100-6527589/" data-ref-id="1100-6527589">a Hogwarts Legacy sequel is now on the way.</a></p><p>The Harry Potter universe was created by author J.K. Rowling, who remains involved in the franchise. As such, her <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">comments on the trans community</a> continue to hang over the magical series.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">At PAX East 2025, Digital Extremes hosted its 188th devstream, revealing details about its upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warframe/" data-ref-id="5000-145693">Warframe</a> update and progress on its second multiplayer RPG, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/soulframe/" data-ref-id="5000-601272">Soulframe</a>. We then had the pleasure of participating at a press panel with Soulframe creative director Geoff Crookes, Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, community director Megan Everett, and Warframe principal writer Kat Kingsley to talk about development on the two games.</p><p dir="ltr">Warframe highlights included a new narrative chapter coming in June, the 61st Warframe Oraxia (aka Spiderframe), and a Primed version of the existing Warframe, Yareli. However, Soulframe is the big focus right now--the game is entering its 10th playtest, which heavily focuses on weapon customization.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Soulframe: Preludes - Gameplay Spotlight Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Gotta catch ‘em all</h2><p dir="ltr">The latest Soulframe gameplay reveal includes an upgrade system that Sinclair claims is "not at all like Pokemon." In the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/soulframe-preludes-gameplay-spotlight-trailer/2300-6465971/">Soulframe: Preludes trailer,</a> you can see an example of a creature you can equip that looks like a googly-eyed spider (similar to the dust creatures in Spirited Away). The trailer also introduces sidearms, which are meant to be used alongside a primary weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">Right now, Soulframe is in its 10th "Prelude"--its version of alpha testing. When asked about the focus of P10, Sinclair said, "It's really about weapon customization."</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still early in the game. We're changing a lot of things in the game, and I think we spent a lot more time than we expected to on fundamentals, where the game is one-third the speed of Warframe and it's a ton of melee focus, and that really took us a lot longer."</p><p dir="ltr">Creatures and sidearms further expand the loadout possibilities, so it isn't just a plug-and-play kind of game. It seems to require some critical thinking and encourages the player to get more creative beyond just hacking or shooting at an enemy to defeat it.</p><p dir="ltr">"For P10, you're going to have what is somewhere between a living monster and a mod, if you know Warframe," Sinclair said of the creature-collecting system. "So, you'll be collecting these [creatures] and that will give you a lot of different ways that your sword [could be] different [from] my sword. As you rank it up, it's going to have more things that you can upgrade and you'll be hunting around for these little guys and trying to capture them and put them into your weapons."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495493"></a><figcaption>You can't have too many pets.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495493-gflx_ffwsaat90o.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's similar to the modding system in Warframe, which the team heavily drew inspiration from. However, in the same way Warframe doesn't want to repeat itself and make another time-travel story right away, Soulframe doesn't want to just copy and paste the mod system without thinking it through clearly. DE has already done something similar with its Soulframe Preludes, modifying existing features like factions in Warframe and recreating a similar but different version in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">As Crookes put it, "Warframe is just adrenaline. And [Soulframe's] slower, which fits with this pastoral romanticism, right? So we resisted having a secondary for a long time."</p><p dir="ltr">Its "pastoral romanticism" ties in with other Soulframe inspirations like Princess Mononoke, which was mentioned briefly in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soulframe-is-heavily-inspired-by-princess-mononoke-studio-ghibli-and-ico/1100-6517404/">our Soulframe interview from 2023</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I can't really get distinct with gameplay stuff," Crookes said about Mononoke-related inspirations, "but the animation reference is a big thing that we looked at. You know, like the corruption on [Prince Ashitaka's] arm and the violence that that created, and there's a contrast between those things."</p><p dir="ltr">He brought up pacts, Soulframe's equivalent of Warframe's frames, which also drew inspiration from Mononoke. "Pacts are the thing you equip, and it gives you your power set and your class. So we're always kind of thinking about how that theme and that dynamic kind of is specific to the world that it comes from and what the contrast is with that."</p><p dir="ltr">In that sense, it's hard to pinpoint the exact idea of pacts from the overall theme of Mononoke's emphasis on the might of nature. "So there's nothing really kind of like that we can rip out from one another. You destroy pollution. You heal the land. Save animals," he said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495494"></a><figcaption>Soulframe drops the futuristic frames for the more fantastical pacts.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495494-gejrikzxuaa_ncz.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Forever alone gamers</h2><p dir="ltr">Digital Extremes hasn't announced the specifics when it comes to the social features in Soulframe, but Crookes did confirm that they aimed to make the game enjoyable for both solo and co-op players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Yeah, the co-op is a huge part of it, but I don't think we're going to make it mandatory," he said. "We're putting out a community event now that will encourage collaboration with the community, but a lot of people in the studio call themselves forever-alone gamers. When they play online, they're like...Together alone."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Sinclair, about 25% of Warframe's players exclusively play solo and they let them do as they please, so they are taking the same approach with Soulframe. That said, the team encourages players to try co-op when they can. One of these co-op features takes advantage of the theme of ancestry in Soulframe.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're trying something really soft [to] push people into the co-op who normally shy away from it. We want to encourage [people to see the] benefits of meeting players in the world," Crookes said. "We have this theme of ancestry in the game that we have in there right now as a light foundation that we want to build on, so that if you have a family history with another player in the game world, there might be certain benefits to share from each other when you play together."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492" data-ratio="0.56230747689723" data-width="3571" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495492"></a><figcaption>The best of friends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4495492-gifb4mgw4aaebdt.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">He also mentions adding message boards in the game, though they realize it's a "brave" thing to do because they need to trust players to give them full freedom over their messages (instead of, for example, pre-set messages). As for other cooperative gameplay features, Soulframe has factions called "enclaves" and hubs that you can join to socialize with people who are in a similar guild.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to try to reinforce people helping each other out in the game by leaving hints or suggestions or things that help people in certain zones in the overworld," Crookes said.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Lessons learned</h2><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is far from finished, but Digital Extremes has been very open about its development. It credits a lot of the progress it's made on Soulframe so far to the early players that spent hours on the game and gave in-depth feedback on what to improve.</p><p dir="ltr">"When we started this game, a lot of people said this can't work again," said Sinclair. "Like the world's different, you can't do Warframe again--[you can't] release a small game, get a community, [and] focus on community rather than focus on having 500 hours of content, and we said, 'No, we think that can work again.'"</p><p dir="ltr">"We tend to be more insecure about our product than we should be," he admitted. "So I think, when we were talking about making the intro to Soulframe, we were thinking, 'Okay, we've got to make a two-hour single-player quest to introduce them to the world and get people to understand the setting and the conflicts, and then open the gates for them.'"</p><p dir="ltr">However, when the team was actually getting the game live, they realized that this approach wouldn't work. "We [were] like, 'No, we're going to hurt the game if we do this, and we need to kind of embrace what we're doing right with Warframe, but just kind of think about the new player experience a bit more.'"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495" data-ratio="0.56253776435045" data-width="1655" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495495"></a><figcaption>Soulframe is more than a little different from Warframe.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4495495-gqxzx9nwyaaklkr.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is a much different game than Warframe, so it wasn't always possible to create a rewarding experience by following the same path, like the adjustments they needed to make to game speed early in development. That adjustment continues to be a struggle years later. Sinclair mentions a time last year where they were "torn to shreds" because of a faulty Soulframe demo and decided that they should slow down development considerably to focus on perfecting the fundamentals. Because of that, they've just started to flesh out things like weapon customization and build crafting. The creatures shown in the latest trailer are a part of that.</p><p dir="ltr">"Warframe is a huge power fantasy, whereas [in] Soulframe, the time to kill one enemy is dramatically different, which means you can really look at every frame of the animation--the foot clipping in the ground--and I think that's what really bummed me out about last year's TennoCon," said Sinclair.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was very proud of what we showed. It's a smaller team, [and they] made it very quickly. The Nimrod, Verminia, all that shit, the dynamic weather things that happen, [all of that] really, really cool stuff… But one enemy slipped through a wall, and it was like, 'This game is jank, right?' It took us a few months to recover from that. Just in terms of headspace and morale."</p><p dir="ltr">One of the goals DE has for itself is committing to a structured schedule for Soulframe like it already has for Warframe. As Sinclair said, "We really got a bit of a bad habit last year with our Prelude's updates where we keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it. You see what Warframe is doing and how fast it's going."</p><p dir="ltr">"It's like, okay, remember, we're still DE. We still have to really make sure we're not biting off too much and getting interesting work."</p><p dir="ltr">Soulframe is currently in development for PC. Digital Extremes hints at more to come during TennoCon 2025 in July.</p>

                <p>Today marks the official launch of Nubs!: Arena, a chaotic arena brawler developed by Glowfish Interactive and Rangatang. Anywhere from four to 20 players can battle each other or team up in the game. And the devs are so eager to introduce players to Nubs!: Arena that they are giving it away for free for the next 24 hours.</p><p>Players who want to give Nubs!: Arena a shot only need to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337860/Nubs_Arena/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit its Steam page</a> and claim it before the free promotion ends tomorrow, May 16. The launch trailer for Nubs!: Arena has also been released to give everyone a taste of the party-style brawl that awaits them.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCsUuBaMdQo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bCsUuBaMdQo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This game supports local co-op with up to four players, while 20 players is the limit online. There are numerous traps and power-ups in the arena, and knocked-out player-characters are actually transformed into stars. The players can still run while turned into a star, and they're going to have to put their legs to the test. Because if any of the other players capture the stars before they respawn as their regular character, then the corresponding player is eliminated from the game.</p><p>Nubs!: Arena includes a number of strange and absurd weapons and power-ups, and players will be able to extensively customize their characters. The game also features roguelite progression and each match is fast-paced to keep the action moving for casual gamers.</p><p>In other free-game news, PlayStation Plus subscribers can now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">grab their free games for May</a>, including Ark: Survival Evolved.

                <p>Death Stranding was a polarizing game when it was first released, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">but for the upcoming sequel</a>, previews and early reviews for the game have largely been positive. In a recent interview, game director Hideo Kojima explained how he was happy to see test audiences react more favorably to Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, but he also explained how this had left him feeling conflicted.</p><p>"Sony is pleased, of course, but I do wish I was a bit more controversial," Kojima said to Edge Magazine (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/test-death-stranding-2-reviews/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "Blockbuster films need an 80% approval rating--I don't want to make games like that. I'm not interested in appealing to the mass market or selling millions of copies. That’s not what I'm aiming for."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Death Stranding 2 - On The Beach Trailer Full Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima did acknowledge the paradox of this approach, as while he may not be aiming to appeal to the broader gaming market, Death Stranding 2 still needs to sell a sizable number of units if he wants to keep the lights on at Kojima Productions and pay his staff. The other benefit to reviews being divided over a game is that it allows a developer like Kojima to receive constructive criticism and implement improvements, both in the base game and a potential sequel. At the same time, Kojima says that he won't alter themes or story based on feedback from players.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-directors-cut-review-the-limits-of-the-dead/1900-6417746/" data-ref-id="1900-6417746">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</a> is a good example of this approach, as it added new content and quality-of-life improvements to the game while keeping the story intact. Death Stranding 2 also appears to have taken a considerable amount of feedback into account, as the game is aiming to appeal to a broader range of players with a more action-focused direction.</p><p>"Once I retrained myself to play it as a stealth-action game, it greatly improved my enjoyment and I started looking forward to camps of enemies," Dan Ryckert wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/i-played-30-hours-of-death-stranding-2-and-i-cant-wait-to-do-it-all-again/1100-6531384/">Death Stranding 2 preview</a>. "Like the first game, it can be meditative in the quiet moments as you traverse the environment.

                <p>Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-team-hard-at-work-on-kingdom-hearts-4/1100-6531532/#:~:text=Official%20Kingdom%20Hearts%20Missing%20Link,looking%20forward%20to%20the%20release.%22" data-ref-id="1100-6531532">cancellation of Kingdom Hearts Missing Link</a>, the team behind the critically acclaimed series has taken to <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436/photo/1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) to share new images of the next mainline entry in the franchise: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-562450">Kingdom Hearts IV</a>. Presented as a collage and without any context, it's hard to interpret too much from the images. However, the forth image in the set seems to indicate that none other than King Mickey himself will be a playable character in the game's next chapter.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">To our Kingdom Hearts community,<br>We’re currently working hard on Kingdom Hearts IV and will continue pouring ourselves into the game’s development. We’re dedicated to making this an experience that lives up to your expectations! [1/2] <a href="https://t.co/4lbg6l2ErZ" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4lbg6l2ErZ</a></p>  — KINGDOM HEARTS (@KINGDOMHEARTS) <a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1922819231965696436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Aside from the picture our chandelier-swinging monarch, the folks at Square Enix didn't give us much to mull over with these images. That said, the sheer look of the game--particularly in images four, six, and seven--has left us even more eager to get our hands on it.</p><p>Kingdom Hearts IV does not currently have a release window, though Square Enix has assured fans that it is "currently working hard" on the title. Following Missing Link's cancellation, it is now the next Kingdom Hearts title scheduled to release.</p><p>Prior to its cancelation, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-hearts-missing-link/" data-ref-id="5000-562451">Missing Link</a> was meant to help ease the waiting period between 2019's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-184192">Kingdom Hearts III</a> and the next chapter of Sora's story. The mobile game was described as a "GPS-based action RPG," and was said to connect to the events of Kingdom Hearts IV. As for why Square Enix cancelled the project, the team offered the following explanation:</p><p>"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players, we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p><p>With Summer Game Fest 2025 just around the corner, here's hoping we hear a bit more about what the Kingdom Hearts team has cooking soon.</p>
