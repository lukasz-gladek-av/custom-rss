                <p>Lovecraftian survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sinking-city-2/">The Sinking City 2</a> has been delayed to 2026, as Frogwares says that the ongoing war in Ukraine and its ambitious design goals for the sequel will have necessitated more development time. While a concrete release date hasn't been set yet, the studio says it is aiming to have the game out in the first half of 2026.</p><p>"Developing a game during a war isnâ€™t something you can ever really prepare for, but something you need to keep adapting to," Frogwares head of publishing Sergiy Oganesyan said in a press release. "At one point, we were losing power for days as drones and missiles hit our power grid. When that tactic stopped working, it became mass drone swarms every other night, going from midnight until dawn. You work all day, then spend the sleepless night listening for explosions, and somehow still need to function the next morning."</p><p>Lead game designer Alexander Gresko also added that The Sinking City's 2 shift toward a full-fledged survival-horror direction has also slowed the team down, as it has to learn a "completely different kind of design thinking" for the game. To make up for the delay, the studio revealed 13 new screenshots for The Sinking City 2, showing off more of the game's setting and enemies that players will encounter. Frogwares also plans to reveal a fresh look at the game soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

                <p>A new report has shed light on Electronic Arts' use of AI, revealing a company that's implementing the technology in everything from game development to performance reviews. EA's position? Employees should view AI as a "thought partner."</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the report from Business Insider</a>, EA's top brass over the past year has urged its nearly 15,000 workers to use AI for everything from coding and concept art to scripting conversations around performance reviews and promotions. Internal documents Business Insider obtained showed some workers are not just expected to take multiple AI training courses, but also use AI daily to expedite work, with the idea that the tech is a "thought partner."</p><p>The company's in-house chatbot, ReefGPT, is one of the tools EA is pushing onto its workers. However, people Business Insider spoke to on the condition of anonymity said this chatbot produces flawed code and other hallucinations, creating more work that clogs production. Other people Business Insider spoke to said EA is expecting creative staff to train AI on their work, instilling a fear that the company may then facilitate a downsizing that could cut talent such as artists and level designers.</p><p>A laid-off Respawn Entertainment senior quality-assurance designer told Business Insider that AI basically did his job--reviewing and summarizing playtesters' feedback--which is why he believes he was cut from EA this spring, along with nearly 100 others.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ea-warn-of-reputational-risks-involving-ai/1100-6531814/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f/" data-ref-id="1100-6531814">EA warned of "legal and reputational" risks</a> around the industry's mass adoption of AI, saying consumers could "lose confidence in our business and brands" if the technology isn't managed appropriately.</p><p>The company was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">purchased (pending regulatory approval) by a consortium including Saudi Arabia and Trump's son-in-law</a> for $55 billion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">one of the largest sales in the business sector</a> that--much like EA's AI use--raises some ethical questions.</p>

                <p>Silent Hill has once again cemented itself as one of the biggest survival-horror franchises, thanks to critically acclaimed releases like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 remake in 2024 and the recent launch of Silent Hill F. Both games--and an interactive streaming series called Silent Hill Townfall--were first announced in a 2022 livestream, and series producer Motoi Okamoto recently spoke about how this was a deliberate move on Konami's part to show fans of the franchise that it was committed to reviving Silent Hill.</p><p>"Three years ago, in 2022, we announced three titles--Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill F, and Silent Hill: Townfall," Okamoto said in a <a href="https://x.com/obakemogura/status/1979174851308032466" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a> (via an <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/silent-hill-series-producer-says-publishers-cant-expect-players-to-get-serious-about-an-ip-with-just-remakes/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> translation). "We didn't want to just announce a single remake to 'test the waters.' We wanted people to feel how serious we were about reviving the series. Developing a remake and a new title simultaneously naturally involves risks, but we wanted to convey our commitment first and foremost. Only when a new game is announced can the future of a series be seen."</p>
