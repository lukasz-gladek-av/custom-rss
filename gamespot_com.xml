The update added a new protection for disconnects that previously caused players to lose all of their progress in the mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's Endgame works much like the high-risk/high-reward structure of extraction-style shooters. Players grind matches of Endgame to level up their characters' abilities and combat rating, and failing to successfully extract from the map means they lose everything. Unfortunately, players were losing everything to random disconnects and game crashes as well.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Treyarch said it heard the feedback from players, and the new update adds a disconnect protection. Now when players drop into matches of Endgame, the game snapshots the player's Combat Rating at the start of the match. This means players will keep their progress that was snapshotted at the start of the match even if a disconnect or crash occurs.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're exploring additional and more robust forms of disconnect protection and will look to share more in the future," the developer said.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">This update arrives ahead of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-adds-more-maps-weapons-and-warzone-integration/2900-7281/#2">Call of Duty Season 1</a>, which adds new world events to Endgame. Treyarch has confirmed the zombie T-Rex from Black Ops 6 and the giant Origins robot from Black Ops 2 Zombies as new boss battles for Endgame.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1 of Black Ops 7 and Warzone arrives on December 4. The update is packed with new content, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-black-ops-7-and-warzone-season-1-weapons-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-7284/#1">seven new weapons</a> to unlock, more maps, seasonal events, and Black Ops 7's integration into Warzone.</p><h2>CO-OP CAMPAIGN / ENDGAME</h2><h3>Disconnect Protection</h3><p>We’re thrilled with the response to Endgame so far and have enjoyed watching new players deploy to Avalon to explore, complete quests, and begin the journey toward the Genesis Mastery Camo. We’ve also seen the feedback: disconnect / crash protections are needed to help protect your Combat Rating.</p><p>So, now when you deploy to Avalon, we'll snapshot your Combat Rating at the start of the match. Earn progress and extract to grow your Combat Rating; fall in combat or fail to escape, and you'll lose it all. However, in the event that a disconnect does occur, you'll now begin your next match at the Combat Rating that you entered your previous match in to continue back on your path of reaching CR 60.</p><p>We’re exploring additional and more robust forms of disconnect protection and will look to share more in the future. Until then, keep growing your Combat Rating and get ready for World Events coming in Season 01.</p><ul><li>A new Disconnect Protection mechanic has been added to Endgame.  <ul><li>Players who deploy to Avalon in Endgame will have their initial Combat Rating snapshotted at the start of the match. Players who disconnect will be able to start their next match at that previous Combat Rating.</li></ul></li></ul>

                <p>Recently, actor Charlie Cox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-star-reacts-to-tga-nomination-says-he-doesnt-deserve-all-the-credit/1100-6536464/" data-ref-id="1100-6536464">reacted to his nomination for Best Performance in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> by saying the credit should also be shared with the performance-capture actor, Maxence Cazoria. Now, Cazoria has <a href="https://x.com/maxence_cazorla/status/1993339680608465405?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he's receiving an outpouring of support after Cox spoke up, saying what Cox said about him was "incredibly generous."</p><p>"Thank you for all the messages these past few days. Charlie's words were incredibly generous, and I'm truly grateful," Cazoria said. "Bringing Gustave to life was a team effort, and I'm honored to have played my part in it. Thank you all so much for the love and support. Tomorrow comes."</p><p>Cox said he was "thrilled" to be nominated, adding that Cazoria should get the credit. "I believe the performance of that character is really down to him and my voice was just a part of that process," he said.</p><p>Cox was nominated for Best Performance alongside two other Expedition 33 actors, including Ben Starr and Jennifer English. Erika Ishii was nominated for Ghost of Yotei, Konatsu Kato for Silent Hill f, and Troy Baker for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p>The Best Performance award is not just for voice-acting, as it also includes motion- and/or performance-capture. Given that, it would appear that Cazoria would have been eligible, too.</p><p>Expedition 33 led all others this year with 12 total nominations, including a nod for Game of the Year. With 12 nominations, that makes it the most-nominated game in the history of The Game Awards.</p><p>The Game Awards take place on Thursday, December 11, but it's expected there there will be teases ahead of that, so keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>
