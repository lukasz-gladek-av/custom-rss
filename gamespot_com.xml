                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solasta-crown-of-the-magister/" data-ref-id="5000-499355">Solasta: Crown of the Magister</a>, a D&amp;D-inspired game that closely follows the rules of the tabletop game's fifth edition, evidently released too soon. The 2021 RPG released to favorable reviews but didn't break into the mainstream. But now we live in a post-<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> world, which rocked the gaming industry (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2023/1100-6519739/" data-ref-id="1100-6519739">GameSpot named it our Game of the Year in 2023</a>), and dice-based games are getting a spotlight they previously didn't have. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/solasta-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-654962">Solasta II</a> is launching into a far more favorable position than its predecessor, and feels like it could be a great game for folks who enjoyed Baldur's Gate 3 but now want a game that more closely aligns with the experience of playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p dir="ltr">I played about an hour of Solasta II and the most striking part of the demo was how closely the game more strictly sticks to the parameters of D&amp;D 5e in comparison to a game like Baldur's Gate 3. You can't, for example, drink a health potion and melee attack on the same turn. Baldur's Gate 3 adopts the commonly homebrewed rule (and now official rule in the latest edition of D&amp;D) that considers drinking a health potion to be a bonus action and not an action, so you could reserve your action to attack and then use your bonus action to heal on the same turn. That's not how it works in the rules for D&amp;D 5e, so that's not how it works in Solasta II. This parallel seems to extend across Solasta II and although I appreciate the accuracy, it does highlight some of the problems with D&amp;D 5e that games like Baldur's Gate 3 have already circumnavigated by outright changing how they work.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448454"></a><figcaption>Different members of the party will want to solve problems differently and sometimes have unique skill checks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448454-ss_a2f5cc428942714e8b9c11bfd4bd30c225755257.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Ignoring the comparisons to Baldur's Gate 3, the combat otherwise feels great. Figuring out when to use my Rogue's unique cunning action ability to bonus action dash so I can save her main action to attack an enemy being flanked by the Fighter (a scenario that lets me add sneak attack damage!) felt awesome. I was repeatedly rewarded for thinking things through before engaging a target. Knowing when and how to use resources is paramount as Solasta II tracks ammunition (so I had to keep count of how many arrows my short bow-wielding sorcerer had on him, for example), and there even seems to be a risk-versus-reward consideration tied to the rest mechanic, as the first time I tried to camp to regain health and recharge the party's abilities, one of the members of the party cryptically warned that doing so might cause enough time to pass, meaning I'd potentially miss out on future storylines. That added a sense of urgency to what seemed to be an optional quest in the demo, but I'm curious to see if this same feeling is applied to portions of the main storyline as well and how often resting might cause a player to miss out on a quest.</p><p dir="ltr">The critical path sees you take control of four adventurers--a dwarf, elf, human, and gnome--who are adoptive siblings. These brothers and sisters are traveling together as part of some sort of quest connected to their adopted family name and the legacy they've all inherited, which brings them into conflict with an ancient threat. It all seems like your traditional fantasy affair, but I only saw a snippet of this plot play out in the demo. The voice acting sounds great, and though face models sometimes descend into the uncanny valley, they're more often expressive and help bring added emotion to the scene that you, as a player, can pick up even if the four protagonists all failed their Insight checks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448456"></a><figcaption>Combat in Solasta II follows D&amp;D 5's rules.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448456-ss_ab26a62f7b0b78fd46dfe698474191e75b2191f8.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm most curious to see how the full game will handle the roleplaying side of things. Unlike other RPGs in which you build a party of characters with different strengths and weaknesses, but only one member of the team talks during conversations, all four members of the adventuring party in Solasta II are fully voiced and contribute to every conversation. The game lists all the available dialogue options for each party member and which bonuses each one adds to the dice roll--you can see how the dwarf Paladin's high Persuasion makes him more adept at convincing someone to help you while the human Fighter's high Insight lets her be the better choice to tell whether the person you're talking to is lying.</p><p dir="ltr">That's really cool and feels like it has the potential to replicate the essence of being a group, as opposed to a talented spokesperson at the head of a squad, like Mass Effect's Shepard or Baldur's Gate 3's Tav. The demo didn't offer an opportunity to see how the effects of conversations could steamroll into consequences, stopping me from definitively proclaiming that this is the type of squad-focused, choice-driven dialogue I've wanted in my fantasy RPGs. But I see the potential vision and I'm excited to see how it pans out in the full game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448457"></a><figcaption>The facial animations in Solasta II look pretty good!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4448457-ss_1877caf6cd5a36481af522878835d1418fd12204.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each of the four characters can also be controlled as a group or independently with the keyboard instead of mouse clicks outside of battle, making it easier to guide them in comparison to similar RPGs. This makes stealth and thievery a viable strategy, which is rare in games like this, as the more precise movements ensure getting around enemy vision cones isn't a frustrating ordeal.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still undecided on Solasta II. On one hand, it follows D&amp;D 5e's original rules to the letter, a 2014 tabletop system that has been iterated, expanded, and improved upon in the past 10 years. And keeping to rules without taking steps to change it might make for a game that is ultimately frustrating for players who have appreciated the efforts made by other developers in recent years. But the game takes strides in areas outside of combat that feel like vast improvements, like giving the player more precise control over how the protagonists move and bringing the full party into each conversation instead of having only one hero be the go-to voice. This is certainly a game I want to play more of, but I'll need more time with it before deciding where I land on it.</p><p dir="ltr">Solasta II is set to launch for PC. No release window has been announced but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free demo on Steam</a> if you want to try it out for yourself.</p>

                <p>Pokemon fans are known to be passionate, especially as Pokemania nears its 30th anniversary in 2026. Sometimes, fans are even willing to pay shockingly high prices for unofficial Pokemon items, including--of all things--a Flamin' Hot Cheeto that bears more than a little resemblance to Charizard. "Cheetozard" recently went up for auction, and the highest bid has already cleared four figures.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/culture/526839/cheeto-charizard-auction-pokemon-collectibles" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, this Charizard-shaped Cheeto is currently available to anyone with a large amount of expendable income <a href="https://goldin.co/item/cheetozard-pokemon-charizard-shaped-cheeto-370g3p?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiOTEzN2RlNjJiOWFiM2Y0ZmFjNzQxODkyYzFkZmI1ZWMiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjd9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Goldin auctions</a>. At press time, the highest bid is $2,100, and there are still eight more days before the auction comes to a close.</p><p>According to the auction description, Cheetozard was "discovered and preserved sometime between 2018-2022 by 1st &amp; Goal Collectibles." It comes with a custom-made Cheetozard card inside of a clear storage box. It's a very amusing novelty item, but probably not for everyone.</p><p>Next week, The Pokemon Company will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-presents-livestream-announced-for-february-27/1100-6529609/" data-ref-id="1100-6529609">be hosting a Pokemon Presents Livestream</a>, and fans have already speculated that the franchise's next Switch title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, will be featured. Meanwhile, Pokemon Go developer Niantic is reportedly in negotiations <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">to sell its gaming division to Saudi Arabia's Scopely</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">I've long appreciated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay/" data-ref-id="5000-151353">State of Decay</a> as the exciting middle ground between an approachable zombie game like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dead-rising/" data-ref-id="5000-24405">Dead Rising</a>, and unforgiving survival sims like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/" data-ref-id="5000-146913">DayZ</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/project-zomboid/" data-ref-id="5000-115308">Project Zomboid</a>. No series or game that I know of has found that same middle ground--<em>harsh</em>, but <em>digestible</em>. But maybe that's no longer true. While I impatiently await more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/state-of-decay-3/" data-ref-id="5000-516152">news for State of Decay 3</a> from Undead Labs and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/into-the-dead-our-darkest-days/" data-ref-id="5000-578185">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days</a> is giving me a similar experience with some welcome twists on the formula.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead might be a name-brand undead devotees already know. Previous to now, it's been the name of a first-person auto-runner series on mobile. They're neat games, but they really aren't trying to do too much other than being a gritty, scary, first-person take on something like a Jetpack Joyride--a fun, albeit one-note, time-filler for bus rides or lunch breaks. Our Darkest Days is far from that and more in line with what a console or PC player might expect of a zombie game.</p><p dir="ltr">Presented in a 2.5D art style, Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days is essentially a side-scrolling State of Decay, and if that series isn't already unforgiving enough, it seems like Our Darkest Days also looked to This War of Mine for inspiration. I recently checked out a demo for the upcoming game on PC--<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/" rel="nofollow ">a demo you can now play yourself</a>, by the way--and the best thing I can say about it is that I was so impressed that I actually stopped playing at a point when I could've gone further, because I want to preserve as much of the experience as I can for when the game is out and my save data will carry over. But I saw enough to know this game is worth that deeper look.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448326"></a><figcaption>Stealth is key because just a zombie or two could be your undoing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448326-ss_a3a0f3647102f317d59fb790c90d3353bcde3023.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Each game starts with you picking a pair of characters chosen as a duo. There's a white-haired high school coach and one of his student-athletes looking for his family, an unexpected couple--an animal rights activist and the rodeo man she once meant to protest--with an even more unexpected baby on the way, a therapist and her anger-managing patient, and more. This surely sounds a lot like State of Decay if you know that series. It, too, gives you a few groups of characters to choose as your starters, albeit a trio in that case.</p><p dir="ltr">The comparison goes beyond that. Like in Undead Labs' excellent series, each character has stats--in Our Darkest Days, they get two passive buffs and a debuff--for you to consider before starting a new game. Also like State of Decay, permadeath is an everpresent threat, and more than just a single zombie or two can spell certain doom for a novice player or a character who may be overtired, injured, or starving.</p><p dir="ltr">In order to keep your earliest characters alive, you'll need to manage your time and their wellbeing. For example, the day-night cycle dictates that you'll assign characters to tasks, then advance time to have them unfold. If you have a very tired character, you should send them to bed while the other may be called upon to head out into levels that seem to be procedurally generated to a degree, as loot drops and zombie density tend to vary. It only took me a few nights before both my characters weren't at their best. Darrel, the coach, was a lousy cook, but Leo was too tired to do the cooking himself, so I chose to send Leo to bed while Darrel went on a scavenging run at less than 100%. That was my first mistake.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448327"></a><figcaption>Set in the eighties in the U.S., the environments reject the drab look of The Walking Dead in favor of some style and flair.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448327-ss_dc729b639f6b51b5e86d0fd3fb7e219a3793af3d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In a level, the goal is to explore as much as you want within its horizontal limitations and then get home safely. You could spend a while filling your pockets to their maximum capacity, or you could ditch the deathtrap in a hurry after you've found that one particular healing, cooking, or crafting item you hoped to find. But whatever you choose to do with your time in the danger zone, it's much easier said than done, especially when your character isn't at their best. Weapons degrade quickly, and if you don't pull off a stealth kill, combat is loud enough to probably stir any other undead lingering nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">You can find other survivors in your travels too, though you don't necessarily have to help them. Like the games that clearly inspired this one, another unlucky survivor is another mouth to feed. Each stranded person becomes a cold cost-benefit analysis. Can you spare the resources needed to maintain another member of your community? Then again, having an extra pair of hands to cook, build, or stab a few squishy zombie skulls might be exactly what you need when folks back home are hanging by a thread as it is.</p><p dir="ltr">In the pre-alpha demo I played anyway, it seems that discovered (and explicitly invited) survivors make it back home even if you don't. I know this because, after Darrel found a new lost soul, Rahul, he later died before getting back to base himself. Though I didn't know Darrel long, I felt the effects of his death back at the base, as those who mourned him, Leo and Rahul, suffered a grief debuff for having experienced the loss. Things were only going to get harder in the days to come for my wounded stragglers in a land the dead had taken like a horrific coup of throat bites and flesh tears.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448328"></a><figcaption>Splitting the game into both home and away sections gives every decision weight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4448328-ss_a18287a7d975ab53c7f4328712cef2d7e46bc326.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My initial reaction when I first saw Our Darkest Days was one of wishing it were more expansive, but after trying the demo, I've found there's a ton of hidden depth for me to explore in what is shaping up to be a familiar--and yet still fresh--zombie saga. Though I generally favor a 3D open-world setting to the more restrictive 2.5D perspective seen here, I also find that, in a world that is already expected to get State of Decay 3 <em>eventually</em>, this different take on many similar ideas is a welcome alternative in the meantime.</p><p dir="ltr">Into The Dead: Our Darkest Days feels like it may have all the pieces in place to be a strong emergent story generator, and in my zombie-obsessed opinion, that's the connective thread that brings all of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-zombie-games-of-all-time/2900-4873/">best zombie games </a>together. Whether it's State of Decay, DayZ, or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>, the all-time greats tend to offer systems that give me the latitude to tell stories of despair or heroism, community or chaos.</p><p dir="ltr">The full game is due out later this year. As of now, only a PC launch has been confirmed, but I suspect that may change in the future.</p>
