                <p>EA's newly launched Skate game is out now for free on PlayStation and Xbox consoles--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-skate-coming-to-switch-2-what-the-devs-have-said/1100-6534816/" data-ref-id="1100-6534816">there is no Switch 2 version</a>. In addition to the other existing skateboarding games on Switch 2, another game has now been confirmed for release on Nintendo's hybrid console.</p><p>Skate Story, an independent game developed by Sam Eng and published by Devolver, is coming to Switch 2 later this year. The game has a rad art style and story setup. You play as a demon in the underworld, and your body is made out of "glass and pain." The devil gave you a skateboard and your goal is to skate to the Moon and swallow it to escape hell.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51U0Wwcmf7A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/51U0Wwcmf7A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savor the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>Skate Story was announced earlier this year and is also headed to the PlayStation 5 and PC. An Xbox version has not been announced, however.</p><p>Skate Story will join the other skateboarding games on Switch and Switch 2, including Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 and 3+4, as well as Skate Bird, Skater XL, Session, and OlliOlli World.</p><p>As for EA's Skate, the game looks like a success with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-passes-2-million-players-as-dev-fixes-a-major-issue/1100-6534849/" data-ref-id="1100-6534849">two million people playing in the first 24 hours.</a> The game is available in early access and will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-to-remain-in-early-access-for-a-year-will-stay-free/1100-6534814/" data-ref-id="1100-6534814">remain in that state for about a year. </a></p><p>If you're just getting started with the new Skate, check out the gallery below, which covers a few things you need to know before dropping in.</p>

                <p>The Nintendo Classics catalog available through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack is getting a couple notable additions to its Game Boy Advance collection. Two third-party titles are joining the lineup.</p><p>Side-scrolling adventure Klonoa: Empire of Dreams and puzzle game Mr. Driller 2, both from Namco (now Bandai Namco), will be playable with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription beginning September 25. All 25 GBA games currently on Nintendo Classics are Nintendo-published titles, making this pair of Namco classics the first third-party additions to the GBA library.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX3DG9XMG4s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vX3DG9XMG4s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/klonoa-empire-of-dreams-review/1900-2817998/" data-ref-id="1900-2817998">Klonoa: Empire of Dreams was released initially in 2001</a>, starring Namco mascot Klonoa and following his adventure taking down four monsters after dreaming becomes outlawed. The game's action consists of Klonoa defeating enemies with his Wind Ring, solving puzzles, and collecting stars. The Klonoa series has been largely dormant in recent years, with its last proper installment coming out in 2008 for the Wii (a remake of the first game) and remasters of the first two titles releasing in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mr-driller-2-review/1900-6123345/" data-ref-id="1900-6123345">Namco's 2000 title Mr. Driller 2</a> is a follow-up to the arcade puzzle game Mr. Driller. Players must drill and dig through multicolored blocks as they attempt to reach the goal and preserve their air supply. Both Mr. Driller 2 and Klonoa: Empire of Dreams were part of the Wii U's Virtual Console, so this isn't the first time either game has been re-released.</p><p>The announcement comes less than a week after Nintendo's last Direct presentation, which featured some shocking news about Nintendo Classics: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/" data-ref-id="1100-6534695">Virtual Boy games are coming</a> to the service. All 14 games in the Virtual Boy library are arriving on February 17, 2026, and they'll require an accessory to play.</p>
