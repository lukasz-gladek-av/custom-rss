                <p dir="ltr">In 2021, Atari launched the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-VCS-800-Black-Walnut-Linux/dp/B08JPKKHCV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS</a>, an interesting gaming console-PC hybrid capable of playing classic Atari titles and modern games. It also supported game and video streaming, internet browsing, and other general PC tasks thanks to its Linux-based OS. You can even customize the hardware thanks to an open M.2 SSD slot, upgradeable RAM, and support for different operating systems, including Windows.</p><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS is admittedly a niche device that never really caught on, but if you're an Atari enthusiast or simply like tinkering with hardware, the Atari VCS is a cool throwback system with more versatility than your average mini-console. If you're interested in the console, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-VCS-800-Black-Walnut-Linux/dp/B08JPKKHCV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pick up the Atari VCS All-In Bundle that's on sale for just $200 at Amazon</a></strong>, which saves you 50% off its original $400 price tag. This is the lowest price ever at Amazon; the VCS typically sells for around $300. The bundle includes the console, classic joystick wireless controller, and a modern-style wireless controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391733" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391733"></a><figcaption>Atari VCS All-in-One Bundle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4391733-atarivcshero.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Out of the box, the Atari VCS runs the Linux-based Atari OS, which includes 100 pre-installed Atari games and support for the Antstream retro gaming cloud streaming service. You can also stream games on Xbox Cloud Gaming, GeForce Now, Luna, and other game streaming services. Atari OS also supports video streaming apps like Netflix, Disney+, Plex, Twitch, and YouTube, plus the Chrome web browser.</p><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS' AMD chipset is capable of decent game performance, especially for retro games and indies. However, if you want to expand the machine's usability, it can also run Windows, Linux Debian, and numerous other custom operating systems via a thumb drive, which you can use to download games and use apps that aren't native to the VCS. Atari sells a <a href="https://atari.com/products/usb-port?srsltid=AfmBOooG8mEm7qyt02arWKOIyNz2iVFmCL58Yj3rFRMAeTExjwAnWEaJ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preconfigured flash drive</a> for Linux for $30. You can upgrade the console's 32GB flash storage via external USB drives and/or the open M.2 SSD slot. The VCS comes with 8GB RAM (two 4GB sticks), but you can upgrade it up to 32GB.</p><p dir="ltr">The VCS All-In includes a wireless joystick controller that's based on the classic Atari paddles, plus a standard wireless controller that resembles an Xbox controller. However, if you plan to play multiplayer games, you may want to grab an additional controller (or two). Both controllers are available for $40 at Amazon.</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-Wireless-Modern-Controller-PC/dp/B08JPJGDWQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS - Wireless Modern Controller</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atari-Wireless-Classic-Joystick-PC/dp/B08JPPTTF8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari VCS - Classic Wireless Controller</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><hr><h2 dir="ltr">Recent Atari Hardware</h2><p dir="ltr">The Atari VCS isn't the only new, official Atari hardware that has been released recently.
