                <p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said that Activision offered world-famous skateboarder Tony Hawk $300k to lend his name and likeness to the first Tony Hawk's Pro Skater game--an offer that came at a low point for him financially.</p><p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit podcast</a>, Kotick claimed that Hawk was living in his car at the time, going through his second divorce. Kotick said that Hawk was desperate for money, so they signed him up with an additional 1.5% royalty rate that they renegotiated further as time went on.</p><p>"We made Pro Skater, did well, but Pro Skater 2, that was an awesome game. And that was the explosion of the business in some ways," Kotick explained.</p><p>In 2019, Hawk said that Activision offered him a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tony-hawk-activision-offered-him-500000-in-royalties-but-he-said-no.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$500k buyout for any future royalties</a>, but he turned that down. Hawk's decision paid off, as he revealed that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/bk8osb/til_tony_hawk_got_4_million_dollars_on_one_of_his/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he received four million in royalty checks</a> after Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 was released.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was released in 1999 for the original PlayStation. It was then later remade for modern platforms in 2020 as Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2. The last mainline entry in the series was 2015's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-hes-no-longer-working-with-activisi/1100-6457017/" data-ref-id="1100-6457017">marking the end of Hawk's contract with Activision</a>.</p><p>While remakes of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/" data-ref-id="1100-6523189">reportedly not in the works</a>, Hawk <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">confirmed that the series will continue on</a>.</p>

                <p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has commented on the long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI </a>and spoke out against the idea that artificial intelligence technologies will surpass the "creative genius" that is only possible from humans. In an interview, Zelnick said the wait for GTA 6 has been so long in part because developer Rockstar Games is seeking "perfection."</p><p>"What Rockstar Games puts into all of their titles is a desire for creative perfection, which is why it takes a long time and why it's complex. We don't claim success until it occurs," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2POQ_toFtgc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNBC</a>.</p><p>GTA 5 was released all the way back in 2013 and has been released across three generations of console platforms, in addition to PC. In total, it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">sold more than 210 million copies</a>. Zelnick said GTA 5 has been the "standard bearer" at Take-Two and the video game industry overall in terms of sales success.</p><p>"Grand Theft Auto 6? What can I say? There is enormous anticipation inside our company and in the marketplace as a whole. We couldn't be more excited," he said.</p><p>After years of development, GTA 6 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">set for release in Fall 2025 across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Zelnick recently admitted the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">could be delayed</a>, but for now, it remains on track for release this year. Before this, Zelnick said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-gta-6-news-is-frustrating-fans-take-two-boss-admits/1100-6528571/" data-ref-id="1100-6528571">understands that fans are frustrated over the long wait for GTA 6. </a></p><p>As for his comments on AI, Zelnick said Take-Two's teams have been using digital tools since the earliest days of video game development, going on to say that the video game industry is known to be an innovator in this area. He said he expects that to continue with new AI technologies, but he also made it clear that AI cannot replace a human when it comes to creativity.</p><p>"The genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human," he said. "We believe in protecting and paying human beings. We believe we ought to pay for their work if it's replicated by AI after the work is done. We don't think it's the right thing to do to ask someone to perform once, use their work over and over again, and not pay for it. We don't think that's right."</p><p>Before this, Zelnick said artificial intelligence as a term makes no sense because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-boss-discusses-ai-and-how-machines-dont-learn/1100-6529316/" data-ref-id="1100-6529316">machines do not learn--humans do.</a> "Those are convenient ways to explain to human beings what looks like magic. The bottom line is that these are digital tools and we've used digital tools forever," he said. "I have no doubt that what is considered AI today will help make our business more efficient and help us do better work, but it won't reduce employment."</p><p>In other news, Zelnick recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-launch-could-help-improve-console-sales-significantly-take-two-boss-says/1100-6529348/" data-ref-id="1100-6529348">a big game like GTA 6 could help lift console sales. </a></p>

                <p>In 2016, Universal and Activision Blizzard brought World of Warcraft to the big screen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warcraft-movie-review/1100-6440592/" data-ref-id="1100-6440592">Warcraft</a>. The film only earned $47.4 million in the United States, but its worldwide total was $439.1 million. Regardless, Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, recently shared his belief that Warcraft was not only one of the worst movies he's ever seen, he also cited it as one of the reasons why World of Warcraft veteran designer Chris Metzen left Blizzard in 2016.</p><p>While appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Grit podcast</a>, Kotick explained that Metzen became burned out during the production of the Warcraft movie. Kotick added that he felt it was "a terrible idea" to make the film, but the deal was already in place before Activision merged with Blizzard. He also went on to say that Warcraft proved to be a major distraction for Blizzard that took the company's focus off of the games.</p><p>"It took a lot of resources and distracted [Blizzard]," recalled Kotick. "You think about all these people who make video games for a living and now they have the chance to like make a movie and they're like helping with the casting and they're on the set and it's just a huge distraction. Our expansions were late, you know patches weren't getting done on time and... it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen."</p><p>Kotick added that he begged Metzen to return to Blizzard, which he finally did in 2022. Since Metzen's comeback, Kotick noted that they have hardly spoken, before asking rhetorically, "What am I going to tell Chris Metzen about game design?"</p><p>Despite Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, it was recently reaffirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-world-of-warcraft-is-not-coming-to-game-pass/1100-6529082/" data-ref-id="1100-6529082">World of Warcraft is not coming to Game Pass</a>. World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-at-20-is-the-same-and-increasingly-unrecognizable-and-thats-by-design/1100-6527983/" data-ref-id="1100-6527983">celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2024</a>, and there's no end in sight for the game.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Compulsion Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/south-of-midnight/" data-ref-id="5000-590939">South of Midnight</a> seems to be exactly what I expected: an action-adventure game featuring platforming and combat that feels reminiscent of the genre during the PlayStation 2 era. Having now played the game for about 90 minutes, the gameplay doesn't wow me. That said, South of Midnight doesn't feel like a game that needs to deliver a never-before-seen gameplay experience. The focal point of the game is clearly its celebration of the myths, sounds, culture, and language of the American South, and in that respect, South of Midnight feels like it's going to exceed those expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Hazel in South of Midnight, desperate to find her mother after their home washes away in a hurricane. Early into her journey, she learns to be a weaver, a person who can both unravel the corrupting forces influencing a community and knit together constructs to glide or leap across dangerous swampland. As Hazel searches for her mom, her abilities and skills as a weaver continue to develop and she comes across numerous legendary monsters, beings who were once humans or animals and have since been twisted into mythical larger-than-life creatures by the trauma and tragedy that surrounded them in life. As a weaver, Hazel's job is to put these legends to rest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625"></a><figcaption>Hazel can use her weaver abilities to glide, grapple, double jump, and wall-run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My time with the game saw me step in during an early chapter, which immediately precedes the level and boss battle I saw during my trip to Compulsion Games last year. The chapter starts with Hazel having only recently become a weaver and making the acquaintance of Catfish, who promises to help her find her mother if she first frees him from the grip of a colossal tree that resembles a scared and sad-looking man. The level then establishes the gameplay loop that South of Midnight will presumably follow for the rest of the story: Hazel platforms through largely linear levels, encountering and fighting groups of enemies who guard the memories that detail the truth behind a local legend.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not sold on South of Midnight's platforming or combat. Admittedly, this demo made me <em>very </em>motion-sick (I assume it was the stop-motion-inspired animation style, even though stop-motion has never been a problem for me before), so I was a tad cranky by the time I finished up. Still, South of Midnight isn't an especially rewarding gameplay experience. You <em>can </em>mess up the platforming and miss a jump, but the section I played through had their platforms so close together and Hazel is so acrobatic that I never did, with the exception of one early moment when I purposely jumped into the swamp water to see whether Hazel can swim. Spoiler: she cannot. The mistake cost me a portion of Hazel's health, but since there are no enemies to contend with during the platforming sections, this setback didn't create any tension like what's seen in platformers that do something similar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608"></a><figcaption>Catfish acts as a guide and teacher to Hazel after she saves him.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the chapter I played through felt extremely early into Hazel's adventure, very much like a bike-with-training-wheels section. So the platforming could become more challenging and subsequently more fulfilling to clear later on. From what I've seen so far, however, Hazel's double-jumping, gliding, and wall-running through the bayou doesn't add any excitement to the process of moving from point A to B. The most disappointing part of the demo was a chase sequence right at the end, in which all Hazel had to do was jump back and forth between opposing walls she was running along. There was no floor, and the crescendo in the music curated a sense of tension and suspense, but when all I was doing was jumping back and forth between walls to avoid easy-to-spot gaps, it trivialized what felt like should have been this incredibly suspenseful run for Hazel's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also feels somewhat trivial in service to the narrative. As a weaver, I expected Hazel to possess abilities and movements that reflected the act of suturing, knitting, or tearing, an assumption strengthened by Hazel wielding a spindle and weaving hooks as weapons in combat. Instead, Hazel uses her tools more like twin daggers, needing to dodge out of the way of enemy attacks and slash them enough times so that a prompt pops to unweave them, which Hazel does with a cinematic flourish. She possesses some abilities to augment her tools, like a stun and telekinetic shove, that use a cooldown to keep you from spamming them, and a skill tree lets you unlock additional moves for Hazel, like a ground-pound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535"></a><figcaption>Sometimes bottling up your feelings takes a literal bottle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Altogether it's fine. South of Midnight certainly doesn't quite reach the acrobatic triumphs of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunset-overdrive/" data-ref-id="5000-183908">Sunset Overdrive</a>, nor does Hazel have a block or counter (in what I played, at least--maybe she gets one later), which are necessary mechanics for a more strategic and tactile combat experience on par with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/" data-ref-id="5000-580957">Hi-Fi Rush</a>. Since Hazel isn't all that nimble during combat, the enemies can't be all that fast and because Hazel cannot block or counter, the enemies' attack patterns can't be all that complex. What's left is a gameplay experience in which you have Hazel dodge out of the way of an enemy's clearly telegraphed attacks, wail on them with melee attacks and abilities, and repeat. Since Hazel typically takes on at least three or four enemies at a time, there's a challenge in needing to keep track of where combatants' placements are, but no enemy I fought had a particular weakness or counter to one of Hazel's moves, so the strategy of wildly slashing worked on everything. And, of course, once you thin the herd a bit and kill one or two enemies, the remaining enemies don't have the numbers to pose a rewarding challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense that combat isn't supposed to be all that hard, though, or at least not be a roadblock in the player's path. Each enemy encounter I faced had a pick-up within the combat arena that I could go and interact with to replenish Hazel's health, trivializing each fight further by ensuring I was never close to death.</p><p dir="ltr">The one big exception I could see to this is the boss battles. When Hazel faces these local legends, the encounter can play out in a few different ways. When I went to Compulsion Games' office and saw the chapter that immediately follows this demo, it concluded with Hazel taking on the colossal Two-Toed Tom. It looked incredible, with Hazel facing Tom through multiple phases of increasing difficulty, but I didn't get a chance to play it myself. In the chapter I played for this demo, the "final battle" was climbing a tree along a clearly marked path. It was quite cinematic and the slow build-up of the music made the experience feel suitably epic, but it lacked the gravitas of the Two-Toed Tom boss fight I've seen (as well as the brief look at Huggin' Molly's boss fight during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgw-To1rqc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight trailer</a> that debuted during 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">Xbox Developer Direct</a>). The boss battles could be where the combat mechanics come together in a more fulfilling way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540"></a><figcaption>Fighting Two-Toed Tom looks so much fun.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All that said: South of Midnight's art direction, soundtrack, character design, voice acting, and writing seem fantastic, so despite my misgivings with the rest of the game, I want to dive into the full story to see and hear and experience more of its world. Similar to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau/" data-ref-id="5000-612207">Tales of Kenzera: Zua</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/" data-ref-id="5000-465527">Assassin's Creed: Origins</a>, South of Midnight feels like it's going to be an experience long remembered for its setting--the real star of the show. There's clearly been a lot of great care here to not only honor the sights and sounds of the American South, but celebrate the culture and stories told by the people who call the place home.</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of love has been devoted to the additional fantasy elements too, with fun nods to sayings or slang in regards to Hazel's abilities--she uses a bottle to collect the feelings surrounding each legend, for example, in a nod to "bottling up emotions." What I love most, however, is that South of Midnight seems to not be filled to the brim with documents to find, audio recordings to uncover, or NPCs to explain every facet of whatever fantastical scenario is happening to Hazel. So far, the game has allowed me to just exist in its fantasy, fumbling for answers alongside Hazel, maintaining the overall mysticism of the locale and the legends told about the people and creatures who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607"></a><figcaption>I really hope South of Midnight goes full gothic fantasy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It adds an almost spooky quality to the adventure, framing Hazel as a young woman who has stumbled into something otherworldly that can never be truly understood or explained. What I've played so far has not quite reached gothic fantasy, but I have my fingers crossed that that's where the story is going. Regardless, however, the storytelling and worldbuilding is superb and the voice acting (especially actor Adriyan Rae, who voices Hazel) is remarkably strong, adding a ton of characterization to already memorable character designs.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope this love and care extends to the platforming and combat in the rest of South of Midnight, but even if it doesn't, the game feels like it will at least be an exceptional tale that's set in a very real region of the world that video games (especially in the AAA space) have largely ignored.</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Game Pass, and PC on April 8.</p>

                <p>Well, that was fast. Just yesterday, NetEase announced Marvel Rivals was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructuring its season rankings</a>, but that was quickly reversed.

Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with

"A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable."</p><p>The update went on to explain how the ranks would work now with the first half of the season still concluding on February 21 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. Players at Gold rank will receive the costume reward, as well as Crests of Honors for those in Grandmaster and above, and the Crest of Honor for the top 500 (One Above All).</p><p>Now when the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To simplify things even further, to earn more rewards players need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the conditions by the end of the season. Rewards will include a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>"We strive to make Marvel Rivals the best game it can be, and the community is the driving force behind this mission," the statement added. "Please stay tuned to our official channels for more updates on the second half of the season. Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and we're excited to continue this journey together!"</p><p>Marvel Rivals will also add Human Torch and the Thing from the Fantastic Four on February 21. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>.

With the additionf of the two heroes, the entire Fantastic Four will be playable in Marvel Rivals, with NetEase having added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-invisible-woman-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-unseen-force/2300-6465576/" data-ref-id="2300-6465576">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/marvel-rivals-mister-fantastic-character-gameplay-reveal-trailer-stretching-into-action/2300-6465572/" data-ref-id="2300-6465572">Mr. Fantastic</a> at the beginning of Season 1. NetEase said it can expect two new players to be added with each season.</p>
