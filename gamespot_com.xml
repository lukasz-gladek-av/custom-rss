          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 26 Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>EA has also made some changes to the game's ranked competitive Road to the College Football Playoffs mode, to make the experience feel more competitive and reward skilled play. All players will now earn more Rank Points overall, especially in lower divisions, which will be balanced by a lower starting rank. Some players may find their ranks moved down as a result of the update. EA is also making improvements to playoff qualifications to reward strong performance, as well as making win modifiers like Away wins or lower-tier victories more significant.</p><p>Alongside the many gameplay updates, fixes, and improvements, CFB26 will also get some updates to the aesthetics and feel of the game. There are over 30 new additions in equipment and uniforms, including some teams' new season uniforms that didn't make it in in time for the game's launch. As the video game evolves to match the real college football season, EA is also adding over 50 new audio commentary intros for rivalry games, covering some of the 2025 season's most anticipated matchups.</p><p>As a last little bonus in this title update, CFB26 is getting a handful of new marching band pop covers, including contemporary pop hits like Apple and Espresso, as well as some older favorites including Misery Business and Get Lucky.</p><p>Check out everything that's new, changed, and fixed in the September 11 College Football 26 <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/campus-huddle-title-update-september-11th?utm_campaign=cf26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb26-title-update-4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=86084&amp;ts=1757570124033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">title update</a> below:</p><h2>College Football 26 Title Update September 11th</h2><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Pass Blocking &amp; Pass Rush</h3><ul><li>Added option to set Base Protection by default.</li><li><strong>DEV NOTE:</strong> <em>For players who don’t want built-in pass protections on passing plays, we have included a new Coaching Adjustment to allow players to elect Base Protection as the default protection for all dropback passing plays.

This prevents scenarios where players could reach the playoffs with a losing record in lower divisions.</li><li><strong>Division Rank Adjustments:</strong> If you’re currently in one of the affected divisions, your rank may be moved down to reflect the new starting points until you begin your next season.</li><li><strong>Improved Playoff Qualification:</strong> These changes ensure that strong performance is rewarded, especially in higher divisions. Previously, playing mostly Tier 1 matchups could make it difficult to reach the playoffs even with a great record.</li><li><strong>Win Modifiers Matter More:</strong> The base Rank Points for a win are increased, making modifiers like Away wins or victories as a lower tier team even more valuable.</li><li><strong>No Change to Win Requirements:</strong> The number of wins needed to move up or stay in a division remains the same.</li><li><strong>More Time to Compete:</strong> Based on player feedback, we are making all RTCFP games 4 minutes a quarter vs 3 minutes so that you have enough time to overcome Home Field Advantage.</li></ul><h2>Why Are We Making These Changes?</h2><p>Our goal is to make playoff qualification more competitive and rewarding, while ensuring that every win counts—especially in tougher matchups. These updates will help create a more balanced and exciting Road to the College Football Playoffs experience.</p><h2>Presentation</h2><h3>Equipment</h3><p><strong>New Equipment Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>6 New Axiom Masks</li><li>Adidas Ultra Boost Mono Cleats</li><li>Adidas Adizero Electric 2 Exotic Speed Cleats</li></ul><p><strong>New Uniforms &amp; Uniform Pieces:</strong></p><ul><li>Air Force Space Force Alternate Uniform</li><li>Central Michigan University Sleeve Numbers</li><li>East Carolina University Purple Fleck Helmet</li><li>Florida International University Vice City 2023 Uniform</li><li>Fresno State Camouflage Helmet</li><li>Fresno State White USA Helmet</li><li>Mississippi State 2023 Throwback Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State Black Alternate Uniform</li><li>Mississippi State White Interlocking Helmet</li><li>Old Dominion University Blue Helmet</li><li>Oregon State Camouflage Uniform</li><li>Sam Houston State Home Jersey</li><li>San Diego State University New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of Alabama at Birmingham New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of California Paw Print Helmets</li><li>University of Kansas Blue Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Kansas White Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of Louisiana at Monroe Black Alternate Helmet</li><li>University of Nebraska Black Uniforms</li><li>University of Nebraska Blackshirts (2020) Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico New Home and Away Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico Red Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of New Mexico Turquoise Alternate Uniform</li><li>University of New Mexico White Lobo Script Helmet</li><li>University of Virginia Stars and Stripes Helmet</li><li>University of Washington 2022 White and Gold Set</li><li>University of Washington Throwback Uniform</li><li>Western Michigan Bumpers</li><li>Names now appear on the New Mexico State University Crimson, Black, and White Jerseys</li></ul><h3>Audio</h3><p>We hope you’ve enjoyed the Pop Song Covers that were part of our original launch.

                <p>One of the hardest fights in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review/1900-6418306/" data-ref-id="1900-6418306">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> has been between the developer and the cheaters. Activision has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-issues-an-extreme-warning-to-cheaters/1100-6530183/" data-ref-id="1100-6530183">warned cheaters in the recent past</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-call-of-duty-is-stepping-up-efforts-to-fight-cheaters/1100-6530471/" data-ref-id="1100-6530471">ramped up its response to the issue</a> as well. Now, the publisher is taking a bow by demonstrating how some of the latest anti-cheat measures have been implemented in the game.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05-reloaded" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of the Duty's official site</a>, Activision cited its in-game mitigations that disrupt cheaters in matches by making their weapons disappear or blowing up their cars. "They then promptly tell on themselves across social media, asking 'Why did this happen?'"</p><p>"These are our mitigations at work, ramped up and powered by new detection systems that have been extremely effective at disrupting bad actors in real-time," continued the developer. "We don't hit every cheater with these mitigations; most are banned upon detection. But in August alone, over 55,000 cheaters were disrupted by Call of Duty's mitigations."</p><p>After nerfing cheaters in action, the developer collects info about the users and permanently ban them. The post also touched upon the RICOCHET anti-cheat tools that are being tested during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">the Black Ops 7 beta</a>. However, "the full force of our protections will be reserved for launch, when all systems come online together."</p><p>Black Ops 7 is coming to consoles and PC on November 14, but there has been some controversy about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">skins from Black Ops 6 not carrying over</a> to the new game. Activision has since stated that a small handful of Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-let-you-carry-forward-some-skins-but-not-many/1100-6534614/" data-ref-id="1100-6534614">zombie skins and operators will be available</a> in Black Ops 7.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>College football players who lent their names and likenesses to both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-25-review-university-of-madden/1900-6418261/" data-ref-id="1900-6418261">EA Sports College Football 25</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ea-sports-college-football-26-review-sophomore-success/1900-6418383/" data-ref-id="1900-6418383">EA Sports College Football 26</a> reportedly received a pay bump from $600 to $1,500 per player. However, that may not be enough for players when EA begins putting together the deals for College Football 27.</p><p>According to <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/group-that-facilitated-nil-deal-for-football-video-game-now-says-its-not-enough/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Front Office Sports</a>, the issue at hand is revenue sharing. EA's Madden NFL and other pro sports games include players when dividing the revenue. However, EA's deal for the College Football games only included extra payments if the athletes appeared on the cover or if they were involved with the marketing of the game.</p><p>FOS notes that EA also left out the language in the contract that allowed college players to opt out of the deal, but the company told Front Office Sports that players can still do so if they contact EA directly. OneTeam Partners--the organization that worked with EA to line up the college players--has shared a statement calling for revenue sharing in the next installment of the series.</p><p>"OneTeam does not dictate the terms of the NIL agreements between college players and EA," a OneTeam spokesperson told FOS. "The decision to remain silent on the opt-out was EA's unilateral choice. We continue to work with EA to influence its NIL License agreement, but these changes were implemented by EA ... The higher payouts in this year's title show the progress, but it's not enough. We continue to advocate for meaningful revenue sharing for college athletes from all partners."</p><p>Earlier this year, Pathway Sports and Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">reached out to college players directly</a> for their name, image, and likeness rights for $1,500, which was the rate EA reportedly ended up paying for College Football 26. Since there isn't a union for college athletes, neither OneTeam nor Pathway Sports can negotiate deals on behalf of all college players.</p><p>The report adds that OneTeam objected to EA's terms for this year's College Football 26, but was contractually obligated to present those deals to the athletes as written. Without a union in their corner, college football players may not have the leverage to get revenue sharing from EA in the immediate future.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Next week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is getting its first DLC expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Claws of Awaji</a>. But before Naoe and Yasuke take on the Sanzoku Ippa in a new island region on September 16, Ubisoft is releasing the 1.1.1 update for Assassin's Creed Shadows on September 11.</p><p>As part of the Claws of Awaji storyline, Naoe and Yasuke's ally, Junjiro, goes on a quest to meet a legendary bo master, which will unlock a bo staff for Naoe. However, Ubisoft's new update will give the bo staff to every player in the game for free--even if they don't have the DLC--starting on September 16.</p><p>The previous update raised the level cap to 80, but <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/62imkAfEdpZSadOqfktQHv" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update 1.1.1</a> will push the cap to level 100. Players will receive two additional upgrade levels for unique buildings and three new hideout levels. For anyone who favors running stealth missions at night, upgrading to Nando level 2 will allow players to meditate and advance time to either 6 AM or 6 PM.</p><p>Scouts will now be able to reveal viewpoints and safehouses upon upgrading Study to level 4, which can help Yasuke and Naoe fast travel. Uncovering every viewpoint in a province will also get rid of the fog once players reach Kakurega level 4. That means you'll get a clear view of the entire province as you plot your next move.</p><p>Naoe and Yasuke will be able to upgrade their gear to Mythic and Artifact tiers by upgrading Forge to level 6. Each item can be upgraded eight additional levels once it reaches a new quality. As an example, epic items can evolve into mythic items, while legendary items can be upgraded into artifact items.</p><p>Additionally, a new project called Sanctuary has been added to the Animus HUB, which will offer fans the chance to get Ezio-themed gear. For players who have the Claws of Awaji expansion, the Awaji region will have some new anomalies that can be discovered.</p><p>The rest of the Assassin's Creed Shadows 1.1.1 udpate notes can be found below.</p><h3>Uncapped Cutscenes</h3><ul><li>Cutscenes are no longer limited to 30 FPS (PC Only).</li></ul><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the game crashed during the cutscene of the "Chained" rift.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the vertical sliding sound effect continued if you switched characters during a slide.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some tutorials repeated themselves after unlocking Yasuke.</li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Naginata Ronin were not vulnerable after using the Vault ability.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the Scale of the Koi and Soaring Tatsu trinkets were not functioning as expected.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the aiming reticle option "Only While Aiming" was missing from the settings.</li><li>Fixed an issue where a persistent "New Item" notification appeared after looting weapons from scout supply chests.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players were unable to start horse archery in Iga because the quest giver had moved locations.

The feature is similar to the live translation features found on Google's Pixel Buds, allowing you to listen along as the earbuds translate spoken words into your language of choice in real-time. Along with audio translations, the AirPods Pro 3 can connect to iOS devices to provide text translation as well.</p><p>The other big new feature for the AirPods Pro 3 is an integrated heart rate sensor--the smallest heart rate sensor in an Apple device yet. This means you can track workouts and get additional health data tracking just from the AirPods Pro 3 alone.</p><p>There are also several spec upgrades and feature overhauls compared to previous AirPods Pro models, including 4x more effective active noise cancelling (ANC) compared to the original AirPods Pro (and twice as effective compared to the AirPods Pro 2), plus new foam-infused eartips for added passive noise isolation. They also feature enhanced 3D spatial listening and hearing aid functionality, IP57 sweat-proof and waterproof materials, and longer battery life (up to 10 hours during normal listening, or 8 hours with ANC).</p><p>The AirPods Pro 3 launch September 19 and will ship with a charging case and five eartip sizes. Preorders are available now for $250 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Apple's online store. Best Buy is offering a few preorder bonuses, including three free months of Apple Fitness+, three months of Apple Music, and two months of Apple TV+.</p></div>                      </div><div title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4311" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[various] Apple Watch Series 11 preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Apple Watch Series 11</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FQFPB851,B0FQF9ZX7P,B0FQFL8PZ5,B0FQFNG2NX,B0FQFM1ZX6,B0FQFVZQW5,B0FQF5BZ8Z,B0FQFWDL6Z,B0FQFHVKZ4,B0FQFJ2G7R,B0FQFPGZHT,B0FQFJ23XP&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Starts at $399 | Releases September 19</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Apple Watch Series 11 introduces several upgrades, including a more durable design that Apple says is twice as scratch-resistant as previous models.
