                <p>Nintendo of America boss Doug Bowser has spoken up to assure people that the Switch 2 should be in stock through the holiday. Appearing on CBS Mornings, Bowser said Nintendo has a "steady supply of manufacturing" for the Switch 2 that should continue to make its way to retailers.</p><p>"We believe we'll be able to meet that demand all the way through the summer... and on into the holiday period," Bowser said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xHJ1SlyDys" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3xHJ1SlyDys" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Switch 2's initial preorders sold through, and the console is still not in regular supply for anyone who wants one. You can consult GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 buying guide</a> to help secure a console for yourself.</p><h2><strong>"Fluid and complex situation"</strong></h2><p>Also in the interview, Bowser addressed the ongoing tariff situation and how it impacts the Switch 2. The executive clarified that Switch 2 consoles for the US are primarily manufactured in the US, while Nintendo also makes Switch 2 consoles in China and Cambodia for other parts of the world.</p><p>Bowser acknowledged that it's a "fluid and complex situation" as it relates to tariffs. And while Nintendo did not raise prices on the Switch 2 console, it did raise prices on some accessories due to tariffs. Looking ahead, Bowser said Nintendo is "looking at various scenarios" to help ensure the Switch 2 can stay at $450 for the base model and $500 for the Mario Kart 2 bundle.</p><p>US President Donald Trump announced a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/xi-visit-vietnam-china-us-trade-d7046613bff2c9ef31162ae8dd436263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">46% tariff on products from Vietnam</a>, but it was paused and is now not expected to go into effect until July. Specifically, the pause is in effect until July 9. A 46% tariff rate is significant, but it's unclear how Nintendo would react if tariffs at that level are implemented.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I walked out of my Summer Game Fest 2025 demo for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mixtape/" data-ref-id="5000-631968">Mixtape</a> beaming like an idiot, a smile stuck on my face. I can't think of a game that has ever vibed as hard as Mixtape does. Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur's debut, The Artful Escape, was a vibes game, too. Light on traditional gameplay mechanics and basically lacking any fail states, it instead leaned into aesthetics, mood, and tone. It was more of a feeling than a traditional game, but I loved it for that.</p><p dir="ltr">There are lots of vibes games, like Unpacking, Night in the Woods, and Firewatch, to name a few. I love a good vibes game, and Mixtape, the next game from the team behind The Artful Escape, feels like it could be the ultimate example. I played about 30 minutes of Mixtape and saw what you might call a few levels of the game, which plays like a '90s-set coming-of-age story but is meant to feel "sorta like channel-surfing [old-school] MTV at 3 AM," developer Johnny Galvatron told me.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6TQF6eJa3Y" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F6TQF6eJa3Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In Mixtape, you play a group of three high-school pals on the cusp of graduating and looking to make it to a party on the beach to cap off their childhood. The party is going to rule if they can just get there, and each figurative step toward that end goal is played out to a different song that collectively makes up one of the best licensed soundtracks I've ever heard in a video game. Joy Division, The Cure, The Smashing Pumpkins, and many more bring so much life to this game. Something about the joining of gaming and music has always been incredibly powerful to me, and Mixtape's way of bringing these things together sincerely blew my mind.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not that the gameplay side of Mixtape is especially intricate. But it's always changing. The main mechanic seems like it'll be what you may have seen in the trailer: coasting downhill in a skateboard, dodging cars, flipping off cops, and stopping to sneak a couple of beers out of your house. But the game toys with not just this format--like a later level in which I led the police on a high-speed chase in a careening shopping cart--but also cleverly gamifies the group's friendship and experiences in other ways. I laughed out loud when I was hit with a French-kissing minigame, where each joystick controlled one tongue, and I was free to mash and swirl the tongues together in what is sure to become a viral moment.</p><p dir="ltr">In a later scene, the teens were driving to a fast food restaurant and blasting music along the way, turning the moment into an interactive headbanging mechanic in which you'd move to the music and rock out with your buddies. There's no penalty for doing it poorly, and seemingly no demand you do it at all. Mixtape is largely on rails in a sense, in that it's paced to play out nearly the same no matter how much you toy with the world in these fleeting but emotionally impactful ways. For instance, you do need to French kiss for a bit, but even then, you can keep it going much longer if you want to, long after the prompt tells you "that's enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Mixtape is a hard game to describe. If you're not one to find music especially moving or important, you surely won't find the gameplay moments carry you through to having the same euphoric experience I and many others had at SGF--I've been hearing a lot of people call it their game of the show. However, if you're like me, and you have some mushy nostalgia for the '90s, a romantic view of bands like The Cure, and a willingness to let an experience be something quite unlike a traditional video game, you'll likely come to the same conclusion I have: Mixtape is transcendent.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Obviously, it's personal preference, but Nintendo GameCube has one of the most smile-inducing system startup sequences with its purple cubes rolling around to a catchy tune. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> owners can experience this delightful moment every time they open the GameCube app with one simple trick: holding the left stick in any direction.</p><p dir="ltr">The GameCube library is new to the Nintendo Classics collection with the introduction of Switch 2, though accessing it does require subscribing to the premium Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack tier ($50 annually for an individual, $80 for a family). As such, the regular bootup for the app just showcases the purple GameCube controller overlaid on a red background, similar to the Nintendo 64 or NES apps.</p>

<p dir="ltr">But moving and holding the left stick while jumping into the GameCube app transports you back to the early 2000s with the original startup sequence. It's a fun secret that injects you with nostalgic goodness or introduces you to how certain consoles used to greet players when turning them on. Now, keep in mind, only the left stick unlocks this Easter egg. Fiddling with the right stick didn't work.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/#7">the GameCube library on Switch 2</a> consists of The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and Soulcalibur II.
