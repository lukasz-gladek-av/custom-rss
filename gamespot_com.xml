                <p>Innocn produces a bunch of great, budget-friendly monitors. I personally have been using one of its 40-inch models for years--whether it's working or gaming, it's handled everything I throw at it with ease. Amazon is now discounting several <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0BY199WV7,B0BXZY18SB,B0DD2ZB3DZ,B0CQ4LN1VC&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Innocn 49-Inch Curved Gaming Monitors</a>, all of which are billed as limited-time deals that'll likely end in the coming days.

As for ports, you'll find one DisplayPort, one USB-C port, one HDMI port, a 3.5mm audio port, and several USB-A ports for all your accessories.</p><p>Color performance meets the standards for Display HDR 400, and Adaptive-Sync should bring images to life with impressive clarity for a $550 display. The monitor can even be configured to display inputs from two different sources. That's a pretty nifty feature, and since the product is currently matching its lowest price ever, it's the ideal time to scoop it up.</p><p>Be sure to also take a look at the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXZY18SB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Innocn 49-Inch Curved Gaming Monitor (1440p, 120Hz)</a>, which boasts a reduced refresh rate but impressive 1440p resolution.

Players can even call in drop pods filled with exotic-quality weapons to help eradicate the bugs, similar to Helldivers 2's support weapon stratagems.</p><p dir="ltr">It's all more than a little inspired by Helldivers 2, but Fortnite developer Epic somehow managed to beat Arrowhead at its own game by introducing a massive alien bug worm, the Queen, before Helldivers 2 could. Arrowhead's own giant worm, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-discover-the-secret-to-killing-hive-lords-nukes-lots-of-nukes/1100-6534440/" data-ref-id="1100-6534440">the Hive Lord</a>, was recently added as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/" data-ref-id="1100-6534405">Helldivers 2's most recent Into the Unjust update</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite is known for its various crossovers (the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-season-4-battle-pass-all-skins-and-rewards/2900-6856/" data-ref-id="2900-6856">Shock 'N Awesome battle pass</a> includes not only Power Rangers skins but also ones from Halo), Helldivers 2 is getting in on the action as well.

                <p>Modern sci-fi survival-horror games owe a lot to Alien, as decades after it was first released, Ridley Scott's film is still seen as the benchmark for cosmic terror. Naturally, we've seen the franchise adapted into several video games, and if Dead Space creator Glen Schofield were given the chance to put his own spin on the series, he'd do it--if he had complete creative freedom to do so.</p><p>"Let's say I took on a license," Schofield said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/the-creator-of-dead-space-would-love-to-make-an-alien-game/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>. "Which I really don't want to do--I want to make my own. Let's say somebody came to me and said, 'We're going to give you the Alien license.' Immediately, I could show you, I don't know, maybe 100 different aliens I've made in Midjourney over the last two years, just because I like it. So yeah, I would love to make an Alien game. I have to own the creative. That's not even negotiable. Because I won't make a great game unless it's mine and I'm so ingrained in it--then I will give you 130%."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4565652-dead-space-alien.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565652" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4565652-dead-space-alien.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4565652"></a><figcaption>This probably won't end well for Isaac.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4565652-dead-space-alien.jpg"></figure><p>Schofield and his team came up with some gnarly designs for Dead Space, and its spiritual successor The Callisto Protocol also featured several gruesome monsters that pushed human anatomy to disgusting new levels of gore. While his comments suggest that he'd entertain the idea of making an Alien game, the state of the video game industry paints a much different picture. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-he-might-have-directed-his-last-game-in-the-industry/1100-6533481/">Schofield wrote about how The Callisto Protocol was likely the last game he'd ever direct</a>, as his failed recent attempts to secure financial support for his new project made led him to focus on his art and writing instead.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Alien franchise is more active than a clutch of Xenomorph eggs at a free hugs convention. Alien: Romulus and the TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-alien-earth-fits-into-the-alien-timeline/1100-6533213/">Alien: Earth</a> have reinvigorated the brand, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-rogue-incursion-is-escaping-vr-with-new-enhanced-edition/1100-6531418/">Alien: Rogue Incursion is escaping from VR isolation</a> and headed to PC on September 30, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/alien-isolation-2-is-in-early-development-with-original-director-returning/1100-6526951/">a sequel to Alien: Isolation</a> is also in the works.</p>

You can even save your favorite heights to three buttons on its control panel, allowing you to quickly go from sitting to standing without difficulty. You'll find hooks off both sides of the desk for easy headphone and backpack storage, while its sturdy metal legs should keep it stable regardless of height. For $95, that's an impressive list of features.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer\/dp\/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">ErGear Electric Standing Desk (47")</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer\/dp\/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ErGear-Adjustable-Electric-Standing-Computer/dp/B0B41YH9B6?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $140)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While the Claiks Electric Standing Desk is cheaper, this one from ErGear is also worth considering. It has the same 4.5-star rating--but it's received over 8,000 reviews. Dimensions are similar (47.2 x 23.6 inches), it's adjustable to similar heights (28.35 to 46.46 inches), and you'll find storage hooks on both ends of the desk.</p><p>There are only a few differences between this and the Claiks. For one, this is a standard black design, with a black surface and legs giving it a more minimalistic feel--compared to the rustic aesthetic of the desk above. It also features four programmable height buttons, giving you one more slot for your most-used settings. Beyond that, these two budget-friendly standing desks are quite similar, so be sure to check them both out before making a purchase.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcade1up-classic-special-edition-arcade-machines-cheapest-standing-cabinet-2025/1100-6534472/">Check Out Arcade1Up's Budget-Friendly Mortal Kombat And Pac-Man Arcade Cabinets At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-6-film-steelbook-library-4k-blu-ray-collection-in-stock-at-walmart-september-9/1100-6530389/">James Bond 6-Film Steelbook Library 4K Blu-Ray Collection In Stock At Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-bricktember-exclusive-lego-bundle-deals-september-2025/1100-6534392/">Walmart Has Exclusive Lego Bundles This Month: Spider-Man, Star Wars, Disney, And More</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-tactical-edition-free-dlc-collectors-edition-restock-buying-guide/1100-6524133/">Metal Gear Solid Delta Collector's Edition Restocked At Amazon (September 2)</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Controller For Switch 2 Gets First Price Cut, But It Won't Be Available For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-deals-amiibo-figures-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-street-fighter-6/1100-6534260/">All Zelda And Street Fighter Switch 2 Amiibo Are On Sale For $20</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-shining-the-film-vault-special-edition-steelbook-4k-blu-ray-walmart/1100-6534223/">Preorder The Shining Film Vault Special Edition At Walmart Before It's Gone</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discontinued-arcade1up-countercade-randomly-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6534222/">Discontinued Arcade1Up Countercade Randomly Restocked At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Rougelike deckbuilders aren't exactly a rarity, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-fable-manga-build-roguelike/" data-ref-id="5000-644496">The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike</a>, due out in November, is far from typical for the genre--in this game, you'll be able to build your own manga fight scenes.</p><p>The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike is an adaptation of sorts of Katsuhisa Minami's The Fable series, which follows a hitman known as "The Fable" as he tries to lie low and live a normal life for a year. That, predictably, doesn't go exactly as planned.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R397YlcIggo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/R397YlcIggo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Given the popularity of Sega's Like A Dragon series (formerly known as Yakuza in the West), a franchise also focused on a former Japanese mobster who gets pulled back into a life of crime, The Fable does seem ripe for a video game adaptation.</p><p dir="ltr">However, this is far from a straight adaptation. Featuring actual panels from the manga, the game instead uses The Fable's striking action panels like a deck of cards. To battle, players place an assortment of manga panels, each with properties like attack, defense, and move, into a certain order before watching a battle unfold according to the panels played.</p><p dir="ltr">There will be three characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, that players can use to create scenes. Series protagonist Akira is a highly skilled hitman capable of dealing damage up close and from a distance with firearms. His sister Yoko can surprise enemies with ambushes, while the hitman Suzuki specializes in traps and debuffs. Over time, players can upgrade their manga deck to make certain panels even more powerful.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking for a challenge can take on the game's Puzzle Mode featuring one-page battle challenges, or play through scenes from the original manga reimagined as minigames.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not only will fans of the series enjoy it, but even those unfamiliar with the series can feel the same tension and ingenuity of battles that the manga delivers," developer Mono said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">Publisher Kodansha, which is also publishing The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike, began releasing English volumes of The Fable in 2024. The Fable: Manga Build Roguelike launches on PC via Steam and Nintendo Switch on November 5.</p>
