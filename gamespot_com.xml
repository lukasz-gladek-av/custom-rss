                <p>For over a year, Nintendo and Amazon have been joint partners in a lawsuit targeting sellers on Amazon's site who illegally sold fake Amiibos and pirated Nintendo cartridges. Now, the two companies are asking the court to render a summary judgment against the counterfeiters to the tune of a $7 million penalty.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/522449/amazon-nintendo-counterfeit-amiibo-cartridge-lawsuit" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, Nintendo and Amazon arrived at the $7 million figure after calculating that the group of sellers moved at least $2,343,386 of fake Nintendo merchandise or games. Essentially, Nintendo and Amazon are arguing that both companies were harmed by the actions of these sellers, and thus a penalty of three times the amount they made is a justified response.</p><p>Nintendo and Amazon are aware of the sellers' real identities, but none of the group responded to the lawsuit or showed up in court to defend themselves. That's why the two companies' request for summary judgment may have a good chance of going through. The lawsuit also argues that the penalty will deter others from attempting to commit the same crimes.</p><p>"This [$7 million] amount is conservative and on the low end of the range of damages available for Defendants' wrongdoing, but it is significant enough to provide deterrence against future counterfeiting conduct," wrote lawyers for Nintendo.</p><p>Nintendo recently took action against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-fan-film-gets-shut-down-by-nintendo/1100-6529246/" data-ref-id="1100-6529246">a Legend of Zelda fan film</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-loses-legal-battle-with-an-unexpected-super-mario/1100-6529098/" data-ref-id="1100-6529098">a supermarket called Super Mario</a> in Costa Rica. The Zelda project was canceled and pulled from Kickstarter, while the owner of the Super Mario supermarket was able to keep the name in part because supermarkets aren't covered by any of Nintendo's trademarks.</p><p>As for the Amiibos, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-amiibo-figures-are-back-in-stock/1100-6527491/" data-ref-id="1100-6527491">Xenoblade 2 figures</a> and Metal Gear Solid's Solid Snake <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-snake-amiibo-is-being-reprinted-preorder-at-best-buy/1100-6529001/" data-ref-id="1100-6529001">are both getting reprinted this year</a>. With Switch 2 coming soon, it's unclear if Nintendo plans to begin releasing new figures again.</p>

Diablo 3 had a major expansion with Reaper of Souls and a smaller DLC adding the Necromancer class. It is possible that Blizzard keeps the annual releases plan intact by releasing a smaller DLC in 2025, like a new class without a new region. For now, it looks like Diablo 4 fans will have a longer wait than expected for the next major expansion, with only seasonal updates expected in 2025.</p><p>Diablo 4's first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, launched in October 2024, adding a new region and class to Diablo 4, along with new loot and end-game content to run. Season 7 is currently underway, adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/">Diablo 3-inspired Witch Doctor powers</a> and seasonal content focused on the Tree of Whispers activity. If that's not enough Diablo-style action for you, we've got some recommendations for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-games-like-diablo/2900-4750/" data-ref-id="2900-4750">games like Diablo</a> to check out.</p><p>In other Blizzard news, new changes were announced for Overwatch 2, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/">new perk system</a>, meant to inject some new life into the hero shooter.</p>

Freya is a former search-and-rescue operative but now works as a bounty hunter. Her basic crossbow attack will rapidly shoot bolts at enemies. However, her alternate fire sees her taking aim to deliver a high-speed explosive bolt for big damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960" data-ratio="0.56214285714286" data-width="1400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442960"></a><figcaption>Freya wields and explosive crossbow and a bola launcher that can pull enemies together.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4442960-overwatch2freya.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Movement and positioning seems to be a big part of Freya's toolkit, with Blizzard stating she is a "challenging and rewarding" character that will take "precision and a steady aim to master." She has both a quick dash ability (that reloads her crossbow in the process) and a move called Updraft that will launch her into the sky.

Aqua, a staff-wielding, water-bending Chinese hero, will join Overwatch 2 as part of Season 18, Blizzard announced, bringing with him an "innovative playstyle." Blizzard at this stage has only shared concept art for Aqua, but said more details about his abilities would come closer to his release.</p><p dir="ltr">New heroes were just a part of all the announcements to come out of Blizzard's Overwatch 2 Spotlight stream. For starters, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">loot boxes are returning to Overwatch 2</a> with Season 15. Blizzard additionally revealed the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks as a new core gameplay system in Overwatch 2</a>, as well as a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based, third-person mode called Stadium</a> that sees players buying items and upgrading their heroes over the course of a match.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>One of the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch/" data-ref-id="5000-355766">Overwatch's</a> most best-known features, loot boxes, are coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> as part of Season 15 on February 18--though you won't be able to buy them directly as was originally the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, loot boxes will return as part of Overwatch 2's seasonal free and premium battle passes, as well as rewards for weekly and event challenges. Blizzard is looking to bring more transparency to the system as well, giving players more information in regards to item-drop chances and rarity guarantees.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cf5dPQ7YeE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Cf5dPQ7YeE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">An item of Rare or better quality has a chance to drop from every loot box. After opening five loot boxes, players will be guaranteed an Epic-quality item, and after 20 loot boxes, a guaranteed Legendary. Legendary loot boxes, one of which can be earned via the free battle pass (and two through the premium battle pass), have a 100% chance to reward a Legendary item.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said it will release more details about the return of loot boxes next week, but it is already a bit of a full-circle moment for Overwatch. Whereas once loot boxes were maligned as a microtransaction thanks to their random rewards, Blizzard is now citing the community demand as the reason behind their return.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-ditches-loot-boxes-pvp-roadmap-promises-new-heroes-and-maps-regularly/1100-6504688/" data-ref-id="1100-6504688">Overwatch 2 ditched loot boxes when it transformed from Overwatch 1 in 2022</a> and went free-to-play. Since then, fans have complained about a lack of rewards in Overwatch 2 compared to its predecessor, with the only real way to earn cosmetics for free coming from the free version of the game's battle pass or the occasional event. In the original Overwatch, players regularly earned loot boxes just by leveling up their account through playing, which was done away with for the sequel.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes is just one of the surprises Blizzard had in store as part of its recent Overwatch 2 Spotlight livestream. Also coming as part of Season 15 is the addition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-injects-more-moba-energy-into-overwatch-2-with-new-perks-system/1100-6529410/" data-ref-id="1100-6529410">Perks, gameplay-augmenting choices for each Overwatch 2 hero</a> that players will get to choose over the course of a match. Blizzard additionally detailed a new third-person, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2s-round-based-stadium-mode-looks-to-reinvent-blizzards-shooter-in-a-big-way/1100-6529416/" data-ref-id="1100-6529416">round-based mode coming in Season 16 called Stadium that transforms Overwatch 2</a> into something closer to Valve's still unreleased <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadlock/" data-ref-id="5000-639448">Deadlock</a> or even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/counter-strike/" data-ref-id="5000-3000">Counter-Strike</a>.</p>
