                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft's</a> housing system will see players level-up their homes by completing neighborhood-wide events called Endeavors, ones that will visually change neighborhoods and offer special decorations for a limited-time.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard revealed those new details about the MMORPG's highly anticipated housing system and more in a recent <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24221516" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. While Blizzard already announced players would be buying homes as part of either public or private neighborhoods, now we know more about how exactly it will all work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One key part of WoW's neighborhoods will be Endeavors. These neighborhood-wide events occur about once a month and visually transform the neighborhood to represent different cultures or factions found in Azeroth. Each Endeavor will introduce tasks that can be completed by those living in the neighborhood, ranging from competing quests to crafting certain items or finishing dungeons. Once enough tasks are completed collectively, the whole neighborhood is rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing an Endeavor's tasks come with two main rewards: a special currency used to purchase themed decorations from visiting Endeavor NPCs and Neighborhood Favor. It's the latter reward that looks to serve as housing XP of sorts, leveling up what looks to be a housing version of the game's Renown track system. Each new housing level grants new decoration items and sometimes will even increase housing limitations, like how many decorations a player can have in their house.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard said the goal of Endeavors is to give neighborhoods common goals to strive for, add choices for how a neighborhood looks, and also introduce asymmetry between different neighborhoods, as not all neighborhoods will be working on the same Endeavor. While players in public neighborhoods will have their Endeavors essentially chosen for them, those in private neighborhoods will be able to choose from a selection of possible Endeavors. This allows for players to visit different neighborhoods and purchase Endeavor decoration rewards that might not be available in their own neighborhood.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529708"></a><figcaption>A look at WoW's housing level system.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4529708-wowhousinglevelupsystem.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Along with announcing Endeavors, Blizzard additionally answered some common questions it has heard from players, like how to move homes if a player doesn't like living in a place or next to a particular person, or how much control players will have over who can visit their home.</p><p dir="ltr">If a player doesn't like where they are living, they can just pick up their house and move. Blizzard said it's made changing home locations "frictionless and straightforward." Giving up a home will save its state, after which players can then "unpack" that home at a new location without having to redecorate or rebuild the home's interior. Homes in WoW are essentially magic boxes that can be as big or small as a player wants, so not having to redo previous work sounds like a smart move.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard emphasized that neighborhoods are quite large in size, with 50 housing plots spread across different biomes within the zone. Some homes will be more isolated for those who want to live the hermit lifestyle without neighbors, while others will be part of small or large cul-de-sacs that encourage more social interaction.</p><p dir="ltr">As for home permissions, Blizzard is giving players ultimate control over who can visit, with options for allowing (or denying) friends, guildmates, neighbors, or the general public.

                <p>A new challenger is rising in the ranks. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/umamusume-pretty-derby/" data-ref-id="5000-524231">Umamusume: Pretty Derby</a>, the free-to-play sports sim game about horse girls, is racing up the Steam charts. The gacha game has been garnering attention since its launch in North America in June, thanks in part to streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce. It hit its all-time-peak of just over 50,000 simultaneous players yesterday, July 9, and has been boasting new personal bests day after day.</p><p>To put that number in perspective, that is just over double the number of concurrent players at launch. The game is now squarely in the top 50 most-played games on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3224770/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. That puts it in competition with games like Elden Ring Nightreign and Warframe.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby has been a phenomenon in Japan for a while, spawning tie-in anime, spin-off party games, and even a stage play. The titular Umamusume are women with a horse's speed and strength--they also sport pointy ears and tails. During the day, they race. At night, they perform in lavish pop concerts for their fans. The kicker is that each of the girl is based on an actual famous race horse. One of them, a lovable loser named Haru Urara, is still alive and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fans have taking to visiting her at the farm</a> where she now lives. The developer even put out a statement about proper etiquette for <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visiting a stable</a>. It's bizarre things like this, the kind of fact that you couldn't say about any other game, that seem to be fueling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-train-and-race-anime-horse-girls-for-free/1100-6532908/" data-ref-id="1100-6532908">Umamusume's word-of-mouth momentum</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you are familiar with social simulation games like Princess Maker or Idol Manager, you'll understand the basics of how Umamusume: Pretty Derby plays. Each horse girl starts with a set of aptitudes and stats which you can enhance through training. At races, they can prove their mettle and, if they place high enough, progress to tougher challenges. But it's not all work. Training is frequently interrupted by visual-novel-esque segments and storylines. However, to unlock your horse girl of choice you will have to engage with the game's plentiful gambling mechanics. At its heart, Umamusume is a game about collecting jpegs. You might have to spend copious amounts of money to get the one you want.</p><p dir="ltr">You can play Umamusume for free on Steam or on your mobile device.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Superman is one of the most iconic superheroes, if not one of the most iconic characters, of all time. The demigod from another world, raised by a kindly couple to embody the best qualities of humanity, has been inspiring audiences for nearly 90 years across several movies, thousands of comics, and unfortunately, a handful of mostly forgettable video games. For all of his status and prestige, video games have struggled to capture the unique appeal of the Man of Steel. As DC's film division gets a high-profile reboot with the release of James Gunn's Superman, it's time Superman got the game he deserves.</p><p dir="ltr">Superman's history in video games has been, to be generous, spotty. Early games for the Atari or Commodore 64 were simplistic affairs that captured his titanic feats of strength, at least as well as could be portrayed for the time. Their rudimentary nature meant that narrative was virtually nonexistent and they could only really capture one or two types of heroic actions and then loop them repeatedly. A 1992 Genesis game was a decent but unremarkable action-platformer. Superman was strong enough to punch down fearsome robots, and it made a token attempt at capturing his suite of powers, but it was barely distinguishable from any other action-platformer contemporary. The Death and Return of Superman game, a tie-in with the major comic book event of the same name, was a beat-'em-up featuring the four "Supermen" who appeared after the hero's untimely death at the hands of Doomsday: Cyborg, Steel, Eradicator, and Superboy. Many superheroes of the time were adapted into similar brawlers, including Batman, Spider-Man, Punisher, and others. Death and Return of Superman was a standout as one of the better ones, but it still didn't portray what makes Superman so remarkable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673" data-ratio="0.73059360730594" data-width="1095" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png" data-ref-id="1300-4529673"></a><figcaption>Superman on Atari 2600, via vghchannel on YouTube</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529673-superman-atari.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These early games largely failed to capture the essence of Superman. Some were better than others, but in broad terms they largely borrowed familiar genre templates. Superman often didn't feel powerful enough, as a limitation of game design; but more crucially, those early narrative structures couldn't properly support the fundamental goodness that is at the heart of the character. Sure, he could punch through solid steel--but why is he putting himself in harm's way for this planet of strangers at all? Why does he care so much about humanity? Superman's capacity to see the best in us--to <em>be</em> the best in us--is just as central to the character as his titanic strength and bulletproof skin.</p><p dir="ltr">As video games moved into the 3D era, the problem only worsened. Superman: The New Adventures, colloquially known as Superman 64, is widely regarded as one of the worst video games of all time, due to its general bugginess, pea-soup fog, and poor presentation. Superman Returns, a licensed game released alongside the Brandon Routh movie, was a middling open-world game without much to actually do. Its most notable feature, though, cleverly solved for a challenge that developers have struggled with: Superman is generally regarded as invincible, so how do you make it interesting to play as someone who can't lose? In Superman Returns, the son of Krypton himself was nigh-invulnerable, but instead, the city of Metropolis itself had a life bar. This shifted the player's focus from self-preservation to protection, which at least captures an important part of Superman's identity.</p><p dir="ltr">More recently, it seems game developers have mostly given up on making being the Man of Steel into a great video game experience. Instead, studios have increasingly turned to borrowing the character, with all his god-like abilities, to present the player with an insurmountable threat to overcome. Games like Injustice and Suicide Squad have embraced the "what if Superman were evil?" premise in different ways. It works well enough for that purpose. Superman is often criticized as overpowered, so why not turn that to your advantage by making him your game's big-bad? But sadly, that also means that Superman's best uses in video games have been the ones that act contrary to the character as he's been known for years, and to the qualities that make him an enduring hero.</p><p dir="ltr">Why is Superman so hard to get right?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4529674"></a><figcaption>Superman in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4529674-4228521-suicidesquad%285%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, the criticism that Superman is overpowered does carry some weight in terms of game design. He is one of the most powerful characters in DC's canon, the yardstick by which other powerful characters are measured, and has decades of history building up new levels of power and ways to use his abilities. Building game mechanics around that level of strength is, apparently, pretty difficult. Make Superman too powerful and a game in which you play as him will be dull. Make him too weak and the game feels untrue to the character and dispiriting. The Superman Returns approach of making Metropolis itself the vulnerable aspect is a smart solution, but as that game showed, it can be difficult to maintain interest in an open world that feels too sparse.</p><p dir="ltr">As an aside, it's worth noting here that Superman is very powerful, but he is not immortal. The comics have established that he's so strong that he seems invulnerable by any human standards, but sufficiently powerful technology, magic, or beings from alien planets can injure him. Kryptonite, the radioactive rock that serves as Superman's main weakness, can feel like a writerly cheat, but it's not even necessary to lay Superman low. A villain like Doomsday or Darkseid can draw blood all on their own.</p><p dir="ltr">So the solution, then, may be a compromise that marries the two approaches. A game that wants to capture the essence of Superman's powerful abilities could begin in Metropolis, giving you the freedom to fly around the city, rescuing people and averting crises, with a gamified element like Superman Returns' Metropolis health bar to show how well you're fulfilling your mission to act as Earth's protector. Elements like technology from perennial villain Lex Luthor or various invading aliens could slowly start to hurt Superman, ramping up the difficulty progressively until the player is faced with a threat that could actually kill him, and leave Metropolis defenseless in the process. Overcoming these threats could fulfill the power fantasy of being Superman and adapting to new challenges.</p><p dir="ltr">More importantly, this could be a narratively satisfying way to express the core of Superman: he is <em>fundamentally good</em>. The Elseworlds stories about an evil Superman ruling like a tyrant can work to give stakes to the stories of other heroes, but they are not really stories about Superman. The Man of Steel is earnest and gentle, a figure meant to be aspirational and inspirational. He has all the power you can imagine, but he would never use it to inflict pain or suffering. He is charitable with his time and his affection for Earth and its people. He gives of himself. <em>That</em> is Superman.</p><p dir="ltr">Any story that aims to be about Superman has to capture that element above all. The question, "What if the world's most powerful person were evil?" no longer resonates like it once did, perhaps because we have plenty of powerful, evil people right here in the real world. Much more revolutionary is the simple idea that Superman has represented for the last several decades. What if the world's most powerful person were also its kindest?</p>

Four of the levels are titled Twin-Frog Trouble, Suck It Up, Handhold Havoc, High Inflation, with Team Asobi keeping the name of the fifth as a surprise. The addition of the new levels brings Astro Bot's total level count to over 90.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer teased in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/astro-bot-five-new-vicious-void-galaxy-levels-special-bots-launch-this-july/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> that completing the new galaxy "might lead to something really cool," so players will have to dive in and see what surprises are in store.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be an Astro Bot update without new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/astro-bot-all-cameo-bots-and-secret-characters-list/2900-5754/" data-ref-id="2900-5754">Special Bot cameo appearances</a>, and now we know a few that players can discover.

Another fan-favorite character, 2B from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nier-automata/" data-ref-id="5000-438557">NieR: Automata</a>, can also be found. Players had long wondered why no Square-Enix, and more specifically why no Final Fantasy characters, were present in Astro Bot at launch, so it's nice to see some finally included.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new levels, Sony as part of its June State of Play announced a new limited-edition Astro Bot DualSense controller, one with a slightly different expression from a previous Astro Bot controller. That controller is still not available for preorder, though Sony said it will launch later this year and that it would have more information to share soon.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-gets-ps5-pro-support-and-new-levels-starting-today/1100-6529484/" data-ref-id="1100-6529484">Astro Bot received PlayStation 5 Pro support</a> and new, more challenging levels back in February.
