                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo has added three new SNES games for Switch Online members, with one particular title releasing outside Japan for the first time ever. <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Mario_%26_Wario" rel="nofollow ">Mario &amp; Wario</a> is a puzzle-platform title from 1993 that was actually developed by Game Freak--before the studio developed Pokemon. Of note, the game reportedly has always featured English text, even though it didn't see the light of day in the US for over three decades.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario &amp; Wario does require mouse controls, according to Nintendo's video (seen below) posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13ieq0wTB2E">on YouTube</a>. Wario has thrown a bucket on Mario's head, so it's up to players, controlling a forest fairy, to guide the plumber to safety across 100 levels. On Switch 2, people can utilize the Joy-Con 2 on its side instead of a traditional mouse plugged in via USB like on Switch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13ieq0wTB2E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/13ieq0wTB2E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The other two games now available as part of Nintendo Switch Online are Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special. The former can get you acquainted with the wisecracking bobcat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-bubsy-game-surprisingly-looks-good/1100-6534205/">before Bubsy 4D arrives</a>, while the latter is a fighting game that lets players take control of Axel Hawk, for instance, who was a CPU boss in the original Fatal Fury 2 release.</p><p>Last month, Nintendo announced that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pass-is-adding-nintendos-biggest-flop-virtual-boy/1100-6534695/"> the Virtual Boy platform will come to the premium Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership</a> on February 17, though an accessory is required. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/#2">GameCube games arrived for Switch 2 owners</a> subscribed to Switch Online + Expansion Pack. The basic Switch Online tier costs $20 yearly for individuals ($35 for a family plan), while the Expansion Pack tier costs $50 annually ($80 for families).</p>

Analyst Rhys Elliott of Aliena Analytics said in <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his newsletter</a> that the game reached 1.8 million pre-sales on Steam alone prior to launch, which works out to more than $100 million in revenue. Right now, Battlefield 6 ranks as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/global" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 1 best-selling game on Steam</a> in the US and globally.</p><p>"All signs, at least pre-launch, suggest Battlefield is back in the fight. Our estimates reflect a perfect storm of pent-up demand after years of missteps and a huge potential comeback narrative," he said.</p>

                <p>Dozens of employees and former workers at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-gta-producers-mindseye-brings-sci-fi-action-to-ps5-this-summer/1100-6529472/">Mindseye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy have signed an open letter to the studio's leadership, demanding a response to allegations of the staff being mistreated. Together with the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain, the 93 BARB employees and ex-employees have singled out studio leaders Mark Gerhard and former GTA lead developer Leslie Benzies, citing various issues.</p><p>According to the letter, BARB leadership allegedly failed to effectively communicate with workers, and staff were subjected to "unbearable" levels of overtime in the four months leading to the launch of MindsEye. The workers also claim that redundancies have been "mishandled" and have caused distress for all employees.</p><p>"These and many other issues, some of which have been made public already, have caused pain and stress for your employees," <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/barb-open-letter/" rel="nofollow ">the letter reads</a>. "Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><p>The workers are demanding a public apology, proper compensation, and several other changes to provide a fair working environment and change the company culture. "Mark Gerhard and Leslie Benzies, you often refer to your employees as 'family.' But we ask you to consider, is this really how you treat your own?" the letter concluded.</p><p>BARB was founded by former Rockstar/GTA boss Leslie Benzies several years ago, and its first major release, the GTA-like MindsEye, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/">became one of the worst-reviewed games</a> of the year. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-dev-working-around-the-clock-to-fix-the-games-many-issues/1100-6532343/">Developers have been "working around the clock" since it launched</a> in an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-developer-commits-to-troubled-game-lays-out-roadmap-for-fixes/1100-6533452/">fix its many issues</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mindseye-studio-is-laying-off-developers-following-poor-launch-reception-report/1100-6532630/">layoffs at the studio were reportedly happening</a> following the game's disastrous release. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-like-mindseyes-developer-loses-top-executives-ahead-of-launch/1100-6532123/">A pair of senior executives left the developer</a> before the game launched.</p>

                <p>Actor <a href="https://assassinscreed.fandom.com/wiki/Ralph_Ineson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ralph Ineson</a>, who played the pirate Charles Vane in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, has reacted to the recent revelation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft reportedly canceled an American Civil War Assassin's Creed game.</a></p><p>He <a href="https://x.com/ralphineson/status/1976428674397491324" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on social media</a>, "Once again, f**k off."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=175622801&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1t4m1&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A report from Game File</a> said the idea for a game's setting--the American Civil War and the Reconstruction era of the 1860s and 1870s--was deemed too controversial. The report said the game was canceled early in development and would have put players in control of a Black protagonist who escaped enslavement and started a new life away from the South. He is later recruited by the Assassins, returns to the South, and confronts prominent racist groups like the Ku Klux Klan.</p><p>It would not have been the first Assassin's Creed game set in North America, as Assassin's Creed III takes place during the American Revolution, set in 18th-century Boston, New York City, and the American frontier. That game generated some controversy in part for its post-launch DLC pack, The Tyranny of King Washington, which takes place in a different reality when George Washington crowns himself king.</p><p>Ineson is a veteran English actor with more than 150 credits to his name. Most recently, he played Galactus in The Fantastic Four: First Steps. He's also known for his roles in The Office, Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, The Witch, The Green Knight, and The Creator. In video games, Ineson appeared in Black Flag, Diablo IV, and Final Fantasy XVI.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake-wont-have-modern-day-sections-report/1100-6534827/" data-ref-id="1100-6534827">remake of Black Flag is reportedly in the works now</a> and set for release in 2026.</p>
