                <p>La Quimera, the story-driven FPS from the developers formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, was recently delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145"><em>after </em>reviews for the game went live</a>, and now the developers have reverted the game to early access instead of a 1.0 launch. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">out now on Steam Early Access for $30.</a></p><p>Reburn CEO Dmytro Lymar said in a statement, "Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds."</p><p>As with other early access titles, La Quimera will grow and evolve over time with future updates, the developer said. When the game was originally delayed, the developer said it encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145">"some unforeseen challenges"</a> related to La Quimera being the company's first title as an independent studio.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-OBrFTGwWI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n-OBrFTGwWI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game is set in the year 2064, a time when most nation states are extinct due to human and natural disasters that caused the collapse of global systems. Against this backdrop, private military companies are thriving, with players taking on the role of a PMC operative fighting through Latin America and battling against other factions.</p><p>The story was created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive and Only God Forgives) and E.J.A. Warren.</p><h2>La Quimera screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449822,1300-4449823,1300-4449824,1300-4449825,1300-4449826,1300-4449827,1300-4449828,1300-4449829,1300-4449830,1300-4449831,1300-4449832,1300-4449833,1300-4449834,1300-4449835" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"></figure><p>Reburn is made up of developers who previously worked on the Metro series, which consisted of adaptations of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro books.

                <p dir="ltr">The odds of an Xbox-branded handheld arriving this year look like they're increasing. That's because images have leaked of the ROG Ally 2, with one version sporting an Xbox button and better specs, according to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>. This would confirm reports from earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">Microsoft was partnering with Asus on a portable device</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, user Huang514 posted pictures of two different variations of the ROG Ally 2. The black version is supposedly the Xbox-branded edition of the hardware, apparently boasting an eight-core AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and 64GB of memory. The images were discoverable after <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" rel="nofollow ">website 91mobiles</a> spotted Indonesian certification office entries for the devices from Asus. Keep in mind that <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" rel="nofollow ">the official Xbox account on X</a> teased a collaboration with Asus in March, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This all certainly sounds like project Kennan. In addition, in possibly a happenstance moment, The Verge's Tom Warren noted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3lollkmjcic2f" rel="nofollow ">on BlueSky</a> that the Xbox app on PC just received an update that adds battery status and Wi-Fi signal icons for the compact mode. These newly implemented features certainly seem relevant in light of the leaked images.  </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-specs-reveal-a-powerful-new-steam-deck-competitor/1100-6513495/">The ROG Ally launched</a> in mid-2023 and became a Steam Deck competitor. Last year, Asus delivered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rog-ally-x-handheld-is-a-mid-gen-refresh/1100-6523336/">a mid-generation refresh with the ROG Ally X</a>, sporting a bigger battery and more RAM. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">it's believed Microsoft is working internally on its own Xbox handheld</a> that could come out in 2027 along with a new home console.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be intriguing for this apparent Xbox edition of the ROG Ally 2 relates to the handheld's price tag. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft just raised Xbox Series X|S console prices</a>--Series X now costs $600--and stated that select first-party games will retail for $80 this holiday season.</p>

                                        <p>The beloved cult-classic, Ragnarok X: Next Generation (ROX), is making its triumphant launch in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe on May 8th. Developed by Gravity Game Hub (GGH)--the original creators of Ragnarok Online--ROX is a free-to-play remake featuring enhanced full 3D visuals and fresh gameplay mechanics that bring the magic of the original series forward for a new generation.</p><p>With pre-registrations live on PC, iOS, and Android, GameSpot is here to tell you everything you need to know about Ragnarok X: Next Generation and how it introduces the next chapter of the Ragnarok series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg"></figure><h4>Explore a living, breathing, player-driven world</h4><p>In Ragnarok X: Next Generation, combat is just one of many ways to enjoy the adventure. Rox is a dynamic world with a real in-game economy shaped directly by player activity. Venture into dungeons to uncover rare loot to trade, or take on life skill jobs like fishing, mining, and farming to gather resources for yourself and to sell in the market. Just like in real life, the in-game market is in constant flux, creating an immersive environment that rewards player resourcefulness and ingenuity.</p><p>The major cities of ROX are also constantly evolving. Explore them solo or with friends to uncover hidden quests, secret dungeons, and limited-time events. Or kick back and relax--shop for new gear, complete your daily chores, and partake in mini-games like Battle of Arms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CfjQM7onE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A5CfjQM7onE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h4>Forge your path alone or with friends</h4><p>Whether you're tackling Midgard's challenges by yourself or teaming up with friends, ROX lets you choose your path. Going solo is a satisfying way to overcome obstacles and build something of your very own, but when you're ready to band together via cross-play, you and your adventurer buddies can clear dungeons, hunt powerful MVP bosses, and unravel the world's many mysteries.</p><p>The new and improved guild system makes joining a guild or building and managing your own a simple affair. Guilds aren't just opportunities to join fellow players to find quests but also to take part in events and earn some excellent rewards, ranging from exclusive offline prizes to in-game loot. Anyone who forms or joins a guild to partake in guild events qualifies for rewards, so don't be afraid to invite your friends or make new ones within ROX’s lively community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg"></figure><h4>Choose from six evolving classes</h4><p>From the moment you step into Midgard, players' destinies can branch into six professions, each with unique paths, signature abilities, and legendary gear:</p><ul><li>Swordsmen can embrace the stalwart defence of the Knight or – for team boosting buffs--the holy might of the Crusader</li><li>Mages harness elements as Wizards to unleash devastating spells or refine their magical arts into supportive Sages for enchantments to turn the tide of battle.</li><li>Archers can progress to become Hunters whose arrows block out the sun, or a harmonious Bard for inspirational melodies to aid teammates.</li><li>Acolytes can become Priests whose healing abilities can safeguard their comrades, or channel their faith into Monks' chants, which offer both damage and protection.</li><li>Thieves can either take the stealthy route to become a deadly Assassin, or they can use their cunning to become a Rogue, where their unique tricks and speed can give them the edge.</li><li>Merchants can become Blacksmiths to master the art of weapon and armour creation, or Alchemists to brew special potions and elixirs that can reshape the flow of combat.</li></ul><p>As you play, you'll unlock new Tiers in your chosen profession to gain even more powerful skills, plus exclusive mounts and class-specific equipment. All these elements mean that you can fine-tune your build for any challenge, whether it's PvE raids, PvP showdowns, or all-out Guild v Guild brawls.</p><p>Every drop is yours to trade, and with the economy of the game driven by the player, trading your equipment, along with the bounty from your fishing, cooking, and mining activities, is very much encouraged.

                <p dir="ltr">Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct aired on April 2, Nintendo has published a weekly video series called Creator's Voice, in which developers working on games for the Nintendo Switch 2 speak about the experience. The latest video features Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, who confirmed that all three FF7 Remake games will eventually come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was included among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/#1">games coming to Switch 2</a> mentioned during the Direct, but the Creator's Voice video is the first confirmation that all three games--Remake, Rebirth, and the as-yet-unnamed third game--will launch on Nintendo's new console in the future. No official release dates have been confirmed for the Switch 2 ports of Remake and Rebirth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm68MEd3d5c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wm68MEd3d5c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the interview, Hamaguchi revealed that, despite his 24 years of experience developing games, this is the first time he'll be creating something for a Nintendo console. "When I first saw the Switch 2, I was intrigued," Hamaguchi says in the video. "I felt it would have enough power to run the FF7 remake series I was creating. That's what convinced me to get involved."</p><p dir="ltr">FF7 Remake Intergrade isn't the only Square Enix game confirmed for Switch, with Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster launching on June 5--the same day as the console itself. Other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch titles</a> include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, and updated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 Edition</a> versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">The third game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, meanwhile, has seen no details emerge other than a confirmation of its existence during the Final Fantasy 7 Anniversary stream in June 2022. Recently, the development team confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/" data-ref-id="1100-6528974">work on the third game began immediately</a> after Rebirth was completed, and that the story scenario had been fully written as of the end of 2024.</p>

The company says that it will roll out an age-verification process starting May 20, and failure to do so by July 2026 could result in a player's account being suspended, notifications paused, and their friends list deleted. The process for this will be required during login or when a new account is created.</p><p><a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" rel="nofollow ">HoYoverse says</a> it is now required by US law to verify the age of US-based players. The studio recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genshin-impact-might-soon-have-to-pay-you-money/1100-6528886/">reached a $20 million settlement with the Federal Trade Commission</a>, which bars it from selling loot boxes to children under the age of 16 without parental consent.</p>
