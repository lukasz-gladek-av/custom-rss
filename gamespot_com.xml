                <p>Netflix's The Witcher is heading into its final seasons, and not all fans are happy. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-liam-hemsworth-says-he-was-reluctant-to-take-over-for-henry-cavill/1100-6535733/" data-ref-id="1100-6535733">With Liam Hemsworth taking over as Geralt from Henry Cavill in Season 4</a>, some viewers have criticized the show for straying from Andrzej Sapkowski's beloved books. But showrunner Lauren Schmidt Hissrich wants fans to remember that there’s more than one way to enjoy The Witcher.</p><p>"One of the things that I've talked a lot to the author about and a lot to fans about is that the books still exist. No one is taking the books away. No one is taking the video games away," she said, talking to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/why-the-witcher-wont-make-game-of-thrones-ending-mistake-netflix-3276622/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>. </p><p>Hissrich also stressed that the Netflix series will not make the same mistakes as the Game of Thrones adaptation. "We lucked out because I said very early on, 'We're not going to go past the books,'" she explained. Seasons 4 and 5, filmed back-to-back, will adapt the final three novels: Baptism of Fire, The Tower of the Swallow, and Lady of the Lake. Geralt's origin story was explored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-crossroads-of-ravens-novel-box-sets-reading-order/1100-6532972/" data-ref-id="1100-6532972">Crossroads of Ravens</a>, which was released <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crossroads-Ravens-Witcher-Andrzej-Sapkowski/dp/0316597732?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back in late September</a>. </p><p>"We lean so hardcore into fantasy at the end in wonderful ways that Sapkowski introduced us to. So we knew the stories that we needed to end with," she added. </p><p>The showrunner acknowledged the challenges of balancing fans of the books, the video games, and new viewers who discovered the world through the Netflix show. "You have book fans, you have video game fans, and then you have fans that knew nothing about this world until the show existed. The truth is, we can't choose one audience," she said.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher/">The Witcher video games</a>, developed by CD Projekt Red, have been hugely influential, offering players a richly detailed world and an alternate take on Geralt’s adventures that differ from both the books and the show.</p><p>Hissrich framed the Netflix series as one version of a larger universe. "I think everyone can have their version of The Witcher, and this is this version," she said. Season 4 premiered on October 30, while fans can continue to explore Geralt’s story in Sapkowski’s novels or through the critically acclaimed Witcher games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">including The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, which many consider a modern gaming masterpiece.</p><p>While we're still a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">few years away from The Witcher 4</a>, the footage that has been released so far <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-the-witcher-4-footage-looks-ridiculously-good-on-ps5-but-theres-a-caveat/1100-6532024/" data-ref-id="1100-6532024">looked really impressive</a>.  </p>

                <p>With The Simpsons taking over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> battle royale, we've been duking it out on a new, cel-shaded island based on Springfield, the home of the long-running sitcom's titular family. Naturally, the island is full of references to the show, both big and small, and you can earn a healthy chunk of XP toward the new Simpsons-themed battle pass by finding some of them. On top of that, we've got a set of story quests to start us off, as well as some found quests that literally pop out of treasure chests occasionally.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a little less hand-holding than usual with these quests, since Fortnite doesn't even tell you what a lot of them are--sometimes you find out a quest exists only after you finish it. But we got you covered.

If you're there when this happens, you'll see an icon directing you to the plant's control room, where you'll need to enter a sequence using the three buttons--Eenie, Meenie, and Minie--to avert disaster and receive some sick loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the sequence is random each match, but you can find out what the code is by looking for these posters around the plant. Using the sequence from the poster should complete the event.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997" data-ratio="0.56227239621267" data-width="1373" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png" data-ref-id="1300-4594997"></a><figcaption>These randomized posters will tell you the code sequence for each match.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594997-vlcsnap-2025-11-02-16h18m26s769.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A new type of milestone this season simply tells you to find 12 "hidden gags" around the island, with no further details. All 12 tasks are listed below, with instructions for how to complete them. Each of these is worth 5k XP the first time you do them, and completing all 12 is another 20k. Some of these quests also grant stashes of loot and/or gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Knock_the_Jebediah_Springfield_statue_s_head_off">Knock the Jebediah Springfield statue's head off</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Springfield Town Square is a statue of the town's founder, Jebediah Springfield. You can knock the head off this statue by shooting it or hitting it with your pickaxe to complete the quest. And then you can wear the head, which will protect you from all damage the next time an enemy shoots you in the head.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Spray_Springfield_with_El_Barto_tags">Spray Springfield with El Barto tags</h3><p dir="ltr">In every named location, you'll find walls with a little spraycan icon on them. Opening the emote wheel while next to one of these will let you tag the wall with the El Barto spray to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Step_on_a_rake">Step on a rake</h3><p dir="ltr">Leaf rakes are lying on the ground in grassy areas all over the map. Stepping on one will make the handle fly up and hit you in the face.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Release_the_hounds">Release the hounds</h3><p dir="ltr">In Mayor Burns' office in Burns Manor, you'll find a big red button on the large wooden desk at the center of the room. Pressing this button will release a bunch of Dober Man NPCs who will fight any hostile players who enter the area.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Dislodge_the_Lard_Lad_donut">Dislodge the Lard Lad donut</h3><p dir="ltr">In the Donut District, you can damage the Lard Lad statue to knock the giant donut off of it--turning the donut into a large physics object that can destroy buildings and cause other havoc.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Prank_call_Moe">Prank call Moe</h3><p dir="ltr">Most of the major locations have several ringing payphones you can interact with. Doing so will have Bart prank call Moe, which will grant you some gold.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bring_the_Haw_Haw_humiliation">Bring the Haw Haw humiliation</h3><p dir="ltr">Defeating a boss NPC--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, or Krusty the Clown--prompts Nelson to pop up and laugh at the dead baddie. Meaning defeating any boss completes this quest. Unfortunately, the bosses don't have consistent spawn locations, so it's tough to predict where to find them. But they always begin in or near one of the named locations.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_Mr__Sparkle">Find Mr. Sparkle</h3><p dir="ltr">You can find this cleaning solution under some dirt in the corner of the Tire Fire, just south of Evergreen Terrace.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Jump_the_Springfield_Gorge">Jump the Springfield Gorge</h3><p dir="ltr">Just east of Evergreen Terrace is a large gorge with a dirt ramp next to it. Simply jump the gorge while hitting the hoop hovering above it to complete the quest. Using a car is the most obvious way to do this, but using Shockwave Grenades, Super Squishees, or Blinky fish to jump through the hoop on foot is also valid.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594995"></a><figcaption>You can your squad can watch TV on the Simpsons' couch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594995-19a470d1177100-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sit_on_the_Simpsons__couch">Sit on the Simpsons' couch</h3><p dir="ltr">The iconic Simpsons home is located in the center of Evergreen Terrace--you'll know you're in the right place because the Marge NPC will be hanging out there. Interact with the couch in the living room to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eat_a_Steamed_Ham">Eat a Steamed Ham</h3><p dir="ltr">While you're at the Simpsons' house for the previous quest, pop into the dining room where you should find a platter of steamed ham sandwiches. Platters like this also pop up in restaurants and other homes. So if the Simpsons' house doesn't have any, try Ned Flanders' house next door.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Catch_Blinky">Catch Blinky</h3><p dir="ltr">This quest is telling you to catch a fish with a fishing rod. While there are rivers flowing all over the island, none of them is suitable for fishing. Instead, you'll need to look for swirling fishing spots in the lake next to Kamp Krusty, and in the ocean surrounding the island. Catching one Blinky fish will complete the quest.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_X_Simpsons_story_quests___Apocalypse_D_oh">Fortnite X Simpsons story quests - Apocalypse D'oh</h2><p dir="ltr">The first stage of the season's story quests, Apocalypse D'oh, is live now. These quests don't give any XP on their own, but you'll receive 30k XP for every three story or found quests you complete, until you've completed 30 of them. You'll have to do these quests in order, and you can find step-by-step instructions below.</p><p dir="ltr">This set of story quests will only be available until November 10, at which time they'll be replaced with the next set of story quests.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_three_named_locations">Visit three named locations</h3><p dir="ltr">This one is as simple as it sounds. Simply visit any three different named locations, over the course of however many matches you want.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Destroy_five_of_Homer_s_signs">Destroy five of Homer's signs</h3><p dir="ltr">Many of the named locations around the map are filled with goofy signs that Homer has put up--like "go" signs instead of "stop" signs, or the sign that indicates it's illegal to be Ned Flanders. Destroy five of these signs, which will be marked on your UI with an exclamation point, to move on to the next quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Emote_near_a_boss_NPC">Emote near a boss NPC</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to find one of the boss NPCs--Witch Marge, Evil Homer, and Krusty the Clown--that spawn randomly in any of the named locations, and then emote when you're close to them. Just don't emote for too long, since they'll probably start shooting at you.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Do_250_damage_to_bosses">Do 250 damage to bosses</h3><p dir="ltr">Once you've danced with the boss, shoot it. Once you've caused 250 damage, you'll move on to the next stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Convince_Homer_to_give_up_the_power">Convince Homer to give up the power</h3><p dir="ltr">The Homer NPC lives at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. Just interact with Homer and choose the marked quest dialogue about the Zero Point shard he found.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_Town_Hall_to_voice_your_concerns">Visit Town Hall to voice your concerns</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer wants you to do some lobbying on his behalf before he'll give up on whatever he's trying to do with the shard. So head to Springfield Town Hall in Corruption Corners, where you'll be prompted to destroy 25 objects before the cops show up and arrest you--you'll have 90 seconds, which is plenty of time.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Find_a_Squishee">Find a Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer also wants a Super Squishee drink, so you'll need to find one from any source, like treasure chests and Squishee machines that are found in every Qwik-E-Mart around the island--you can buy three Squishees for 300 gold from these machines.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deliver_it_to_Homer">Deliver it to Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">You'll need to bring Homer the Super Squishee, but you'll need to take a specific route marked by checkpoint hoops--going directly to him by any other path won't count. You'll have four minutes from the moment you enter a Kwik-E-Mart or pick up a Squishee to complete the quest, or else you'll have to start this stage again.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Enter_the_Simpsons_house_and_inspect_different_remotes">Enter the Simpsons house and inspect different remotes</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer is being stubborn, so you'll need to visit the Simpsons' home in Evergreen Terrace to investigate what he's planning. Once you're there, you'll need to inspect five remote controls, which are scattered around the house and marked with exclamation points.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Confront_Homer">Confront Homer</h3><p dir="ltr">All that's left from here is talking. Return once again to Homer at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and click through the quest dialogue to complete this stage.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Return_to_Hope">Return to Hope</h3><p dir="ltr">Then, visit the NPC Hope at the donut shop in Donut District, and click through her quest dialogue to complete the first wave of story quests for Fortnite's Simpsons season.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_x_Simpsons_Lost_and_Found_quests">Fortnite x Simpsons Lost and Found quests</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594996"></a><figcaption>Lost and Found quests come from these objects that sometimes pop out of chests.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4594996-19a470ce2cc58-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>You won't find these quests in your menu, because they drop from treasure chests and ammo boxes, and you can also pick one up from the NPCs who offer them, which are Homer, Marge, Lisa, and Bart. These repeatable quests award high-quality loot for each one that you complete, as well as 1k XP. Plus, there's the 30k XP you receive for every three found or story quests you do, until you've done 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">There are four types of these quests right now, one for each member of the Simpson clan.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Marge_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Marge's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Marge wants you to collect some items, either several of the same thing, or different items of a certain rarity--like three uncommon items, which are green rarity.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Homer_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Homer's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Homer's quests involve driving a distance in a vehicle. Just find a car, and do some driving.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Lisa_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Lisa's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Lisa will task you with finding her lost textbooks, which are scattered around whichever named location is nearest. You'll need to look for exclamation points on your mini-map to see where the books are, since they spawn randomly around each location.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Bart_s_Lost_and_Found_quests">Bart's Lost and Found quests</h3><p dir="ltr">Bart's quests require you to be destructive, either by damaging enemies or breaking stuff.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594994"></a><figcaption>The home of the Simpsons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4594994-screenshot1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Kickstart_quests">Kickstart quests</h2><p dir="ltr">Finally, we have the season-long Kickstart quests that exist to encourage you to get acquainted with the new mechanics in Fortnite's Simpsons season. These are fairly simple and uncomplicated, and we'll explain them all below. Each of these quests is worth 30k XP.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Visit_the_Simpsons_house">Visit the Simpsons house</h3><p dir="ltr">In the center of Evergreen Terrace, on the east side of the central square, is the iconic Simpsons house, pictured above for reference. Entering it will complete this quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Defeat_two_bosses_or_elite_guards">Defeat two bosses or elite guards</h3><p dir="ltr">The three boss NPCs--Evil Homer, Witch Marge, and Krusty the Clown--spawn randomly in named locations each match, but you can also find Dober Man guards near the KBBL Radio Towers. You can also spawn Dober Man guards by pressing the big red button on the desk in Burns Manor. Defeat two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Raise_the_flag_at_Kamp_Krusty">Raise the flag at Kamp Krusty</h3><p dir="ltr">There's a control point at Kamp Krusty that's been graced with a Camp Bart flag. Capture it to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Secure_KBBL_Radio_Towers_two_times">Secure KBBL Radio Towers two times</h3><p dir="ltr">These radio towers are serving at the storm forecast towers this season. Defeat the Dober Man guards and deliver the keycard they dropped to the radio tower for a weather forecast. Do this twice to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_opponents_with_Mr__Blasty__1_000_points_of_damage_">Damage opponents with Mr. Blasty (1,000 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">Mr. Blasty is a new revolver in the loot pool this season, which drops from all normal sources of loot. You just need to shoot your enemies with it--bosses and other NPC enemies count for this.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Damage_Dober_Men__300_points_of_damage_">Damage Dober Men (300 points of damage)</h3><p dir="ltr">The Dober Man guards can be found at KBBL Radio Towers, and in Burns Manor if you press the red button on the desk in Burns' office.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Search_Mr__Burns_Mystery_Boxes">Search Mr. Burns Mystery Boxes</h3><p dir="ltr">Instead of normal blue chests, Simpsons season has added these question mark-covered boxes with enhanced loot. Search two of them to complete the quest.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Travel_distance_while_sprinting_under_the_effects_of_Super_Squishee">Travel distance while sprinting under the effects of Super Squishee</h3><p dir="ltr">Drinking a Super Squishee drink, which can be purchased from any Qwik-E-Mart, gives you unlimited sprint, low gravity, and fast sprint for a limited time. Sprint for 250 meters while under that effect to complete the quest. You'll need to stay on the ground for this one, though, as distance traveled in the air doesn't count.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Use_the_Zero_Point_dash_four_times_after_consuming_a_Blinky_Fish">Use the Zero Point dash four times after consuming a Blinky Fish</h3><p dir="ltr">Eating a Blinky fish will give you a dash ability for a short time. Just hit the jump button while you're in the air to dash in any direction--the quest will complete after you've dashed four times.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Complete_a_Lost_and_Found_quest">Complete a Lost and Found quest</h3><p dir="ltr">Complete any of the quests in the Lost and Found section above for this one.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A weird invincibility exploit has apparently led to Epic Games disabling The Simpsons couch in Fortnite. That means players can't take a seat on the iconic piece of animated furniture currently. The timing is also unfortunate, since last night's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-just-had-a-bananas-fortnite-couch-gag-and-poor-peely-didnt-fare-well/1100-6535878/">Simpsons episode featured an opening couch gag with Fortnite characters</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" rel="nofollow ">official Fortnite Status account on X</a> posted about the couch issue at 8:05 PM ET on November 2, which is literally five minutes after The Simpsons started last night. The couch gag saw poor Peely meet an unfortunate fate and brought an unsettling new meaning to Fortnite skin. Meanwhile, an account named <a href="https://x.com/Relishh_/status/1985160615044767790" rel="nofollow ">Relishh on X</a> believes the couch was disabled in-game because the interaction could lead to invincibility for players.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🛋️ We’ve temporarily disabled the Simpsons Couch in Fortnite to fix an issue. <br>We’ll fix this and get you and the squad back on the couch to clip your own Simpsons intros as soon as we can.</p>  — Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1985151319716376789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The odd glitch reportedly required bringing Homer's car to the furniture, pickaxing the vehicle to zero health, then sitting on the couch. This would lead to an explosion and player's health being set to zero permanently. A squadmate then could revive the Fortnite player, making them invincible for the rest of the match.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/#1">The Simpsons season just went live in Fortnite</a> over the weekend. The collaboration has seen the entire island transformed into a Springfield map, featuring show locations like the nuclear power plant where Homer works, Moe's Tavern, and of course the home of the Simpsons with their couch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/">The battle-royale game's Battle Pass</a> is all about the long-running animated show, too, and players can even unlock a <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Stupid_Sexy_Flanders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stupid Sexy Flanders</a> skin.</p><p>Of course, this won't be the last Fortnite collaboration. In fact, dataminers are suggesting that upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">crossovers could include SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>

                <p>It remains to be seen what price Rockstar Games will charge for the eagerly awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but some are speculating that it could be $80, $90, or even $100. Nothing is confirmed right now, but GTA 5 actor Jay Klaitz--who played Lester--has now said he believes GTA 6 warrants a $100 price tag due to the content it's expected to offer.</p><p>"These games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It's not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter," <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Escapist</a>. "This sh** takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You're almost buying multiple games when you buy the one."</p>

<p>Klaitz said there is also a case to be made for making GTA 6 priced at a level where it can be "more accessible," but if it is $100, that would make sense to him.</p><p>"I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That's cool too. Maybe there's like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that," he said.</p><p>Sales data for video games shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, but it's still anyone's guess as to the price for GTA 6. Other experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">$70 is the right price. </a>At least one developer maintains that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">GTA 6 "deserves" to be $100</a> due to the size and scope of the project. Some have said the game does not need to be $100 because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">the game's expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p><p>The discussion around a possible $100 price for GTA 6 stems back to researcher Matthew Ball, who said in a memo in January 2025 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"there is hope"</a> from people in gaming that GTA 6 could be priced between $80 and $100. He pointed out that, adjusted for inflation, GTA 4 was priced at $90 and GTA 5 was $83. Things like movie tickets, rent, subscription services like Spotify and Netflix, gas, groceries, and numerous other items have gone up in price while video games have remained at "record lows," Ball said. His own personal prediction is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 will be priced at $70.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Klaitz said he would like to see a future GTA game take place outside America and possibly go somewhere like Dubai. "You could be in like a big city with huge skyscrapers but then you’re out in the desert one minute later. GTA: Dubai would give you a lot of fun environments and scenarios to play with and build a game on," he said, adding that other options could be the North Pole or Greenland.</p><p>Klaitz also talked about the possibility of a GTA TV series, saying it would be "really cool to try to pull off," adding that he would personally like to see it be a live-action show as opposed to animation.</p><p>"It would be tough to translate because it's that sandbox-type game and people can do whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want. It's hard to sort of refocus that into a straight narrative. But it would be fun to try," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">months of teasing</a>, Disney's Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge will receive a major update in 2026 and could connect to the ongoing events in Fortnite. According to insider Drew Smith, the new mission will feature The Mandalorian and Grogu, giving guests a fresh adventure inside the Star Wars universe.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/DrewDisneyDude/status/1985082189713997886" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">CONFIRMED: Millennium Falcon: Smugglers Run’s new Mandalorian and Grogu mission will connect to the Disney games and entertainment universe coming to Fortnite.<br>The mission will leverage Epic Games’ Unreal Engine for “seamless, cross-platform storytelling.”<br>Disney says that… <a href="https://t.co/5anYpmW6Re" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/5anYpmW6Re</a></p>  — Drew Smith (@DrewDisneyDude) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrewDisneyDude/status/1985082189713997886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Disney's partnership with Epic Games aims to bring advanced technology and interactive storytelling to theme parks. While the collaboration between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-fortnite-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6534455/" data-ref-id="1100-6534455">Disney and Epic is official</a>, Smith reports that the connection between the upcoming Disney x Fortnite universe will create "seamless, cross-platform storytelling" between parks, games, and other entertainment.</p><p>However, Disney and Epic have not yet made a public statement confirming how this connection will work. Earlier reports and leaks have hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">Disney’s $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games</a> is funding a large-scale online world where progress from park attractions could influence gameplay in Fortnite. For example, guests who complete the new Smugglers Run mission might earn in-game rewards or status in the Disney x Fortnite experience--but this has not yet been officially detailed.</p><p>Still, Disney executives have stated that the company's future lies in connecting movies, games, and attractions into one shared digital ecosystem. The upcoming Smugglers Run update may be the first clear step in that direction, combining storytelling, gaming technology, and theme park interactivity in ways that blur the line between real and virtual worlds.</p>

                <p>With the holiday season drawing closer--and radio stations warming up their Mariah Carey Christmas playlists--PlayStation is rolling out a new advertising campaign to convince people that the PS5 is the place to be. This year, the theme is "it happens on PS5," and Sony has rolled out three ads showcasing scenes familiar to gamers.</p><p>First off, there's the stunt jump showcasing an ambitious--but failed--attempt to do a Superman and make an 18-wheeler leap over a tall building:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woGbrJqimvE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/woGbrJqimvE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The Unexpected Catch" shows off some fishy body horror that wouldn't look out of place in a David Cronenberg movie:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyYzIT7kNUY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uyYzIT7kNUY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>And finally, "Everyday Problems in Everyday Vehicles" proves that even in a future where interstellar ships are the norm, you just can't beat a good truck when it comes to reliability:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTi78EVDDJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VTi78EVDDJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox has launched its own holiday marketing campaign by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-leans-into-ex-boxer-meme-for-new-advert/1100-6535874/" data-ref-id="1100-6535874">leaning into the ex-boxer meme</a>.</p><p>This month marks the fifth anniversary of the PS5, as it first went on sale on November 12, 2020. In the years since it launched, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-reach-80-million-worldwide-in-latest-milestone/1100-6533755/">the PS5 has reached 80.3 million unit sales</a> as of August 7, 2025, making it race neck-and-neck with its predecessor, the PS4, at the same time during its life-cycle. One area where the PS5 has been a big sales hit is the PlayStation Network, as Sony has grown its user base substantially here.</p><p>While November marks a major milestone for the PS5, attention is starting to shift toward the future of the console brand. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/">Amidst talk of a modular design</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">rumored PS6</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">reliance on traditional game delivery systems</a>, Sony also recently teased some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">innovative tech that will power its future gaming hardware</a>, which it's developing in partnership with AMD.</p>
