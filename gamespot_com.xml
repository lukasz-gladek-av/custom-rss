                <p>The talent behind Critical Role have previously hinted at their collective desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-may-expand-into-video-games/1100-6528190/" data-ref-id="1100-6528190">to create a video game</a>. Now, it's finally happening as Critical Role has partnered up with AdHoc, the developer behind the upcoming superhero action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dispatch/" data-ref-id="5000-654979">Dispatch</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/critical-role-first-video-game-development-adhoc-studio-1236463963/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the new game will be set in Exandria, the world that was created for Critical Role's fantasy campaigns. Critical Role's Travis Willingham also indicated that characters from the Vox Machina, Mighty Nein, and Bells Hells could appear, but the story "would have to be something brand new."</p><p>Willingham was instrumental in bringing AdHoc into co-development on the new game after he was cast in Dispatch. He noted that Critical Role wants to follow Dispatch's template and open up the narrative based on player choices.</p><p>"We're tossing around ideas, what are we thinking about in terms of scope and budget, and some of the things we must have," said Willingham. "You are going to want to see your favorite characters."</p><p>The actor went on to explain that Critical Role doesn't see its new endeavor as a AAA title, and the team wants to complete the game in a faster timeframe than the typical five-year cycle for larger projects.</p><p>Earlier this year, Critical Role's Darrington Press <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-designers-join-critical-role-publisher/1100-6532474/" data-ref-id="1100-6532474">hired two of the designers behind Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th Edition</a> to create new fantasy projects for the company. More recently, Critical Role lined up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-notes-include-critical-role-collab-new-difficulty-mode/1100-6532694/" data-ref-id="1100-6532694">a collaboration with Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">After cryptic teases across social media--as well as a special teaser site created just for this new project--Saber Interactive has finally lifted the curtain on its next hellish adventure. Hellraiser: Revival is a new first-person survival horror adventure set in Clive Barker's Hellraiser universe--with an old friend and his original actor in the starring role.</p><p dir="ltr">Hellraiser: Revival follows Aidan, whose girlfriend unwittingly unleashes Pinhead--who will be portrayed by Doug Bradley for the first time in 20 years--and his Cenobite horde to drag her to Hell. Aiden must rescue his girlfriend from the Cenobites by following her into Hell, which the players will do in a first-person survival horror setting.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_4kAp6gsZE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E_4kAp6gsZE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>Aidan will use the Genesis Configuration puzzle box, along with an arsenal of other weapons, to fight the horrific Cenobite entity. Weapons shown in the announcement trailer--which has a redband version on the <a href="http://www.hellraisergame.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official website</a>--include a knife and a baseball bat with nails in it, while we also get to see at least one kill with the powerful puzzle box itself.</span></p><p dir="ltr">Teasers for this new Hellraiser project began last week, as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saber-interactive-is-teasing-something-with-spooky-vibes-for-later-this-month/1100-6533234/">teaser website</a> with the URL <a href="https://july-22-2025.com/" rel="nofollow ">https://july-22-2025.com</a> mysteriously appeared--which showed nothing but static mixed with a brief flash of the number 55. Saber Interactive's official social media channels began pointing to the site, along with other teasers and a montage of horror-focused content creators reacting to the announcement trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">Hellraiser: Revival will launch on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC, but no official release window was confirmed in the announcement.</p>

If you're excited for what's next for Pokemon, but you need a way to pass the time, fear not: DJ Pikachu has arrived, and he's bringing an hour's worth of sick beats to lead you in.</p><p>The electric Pokemon's DJ set is happening now until the Pokemon Presents begins at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET, and he's spinning Pokemon-themed music while a timer counts down to the exact start of the show. The set started slowly, with a lone Pikachu falling asleep in front of the DJ booth, but the star has since taken the stage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsskPQsZRaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MsskPQsZRaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Pokemon Presents livestream was first announced in late May, though no specific details were given as to what would be unveiled during the event.
