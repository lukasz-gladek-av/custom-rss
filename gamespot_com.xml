Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">estimated of that Switch 2 would sell 15 million units</a> in this fiscal year. Other analysts suggested 17.6 million consoles in that timeframe. However, the projected increase in production may push Switch 2 to 25 million in sales by the end of Nintendo's fiscal year in March 2026.</p><p>Nintendo has also revealed that the beloved GameCube title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luigis-mansion/" data-ref-id="5000-3596">Luigi's Mansion</a> is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/luigis-mansion-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-time-for-halloween/1100-6535610/" data-ref-id="1100-6535610">coming to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack service</a> on October 30. The game was originally released in November 2001, and it gave Luigi a rare solo adventure as he tried to rid his new haunted mansion of the countless ghosts that linger there. Since then, it has gotten two sequels, which first launched on 3DS and Switch, respectively.</p><p>The other GameCube titles currently available through Switch Online include The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, SoulCalibur II, Super Mario Strikers, and Chibi-Robo. Nintendo Switch Online members can even <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">buy a GameCube controller for Switch 2</a> at the My Nintendo Store.</p>

                <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total pay package for fiscal 2025 has been confirmed, and the executive earned a total of $96.5 million for the year. That is up 22% from the previous year and represents his highest-ever annual pay. It's a massive multiple over what the median Microsoft worker makes, with the median worker taking home around $200,000.</p><p>The executive's pay details are coming to light as the company faces scrutiny over its recent Xbox decisions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">layoffs, game cancellations, studio closures, price hikes, and increasing profit-margin mandates.</a> The company as a whole has faced ongoing criticism as well due to its slate of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-ceo-told-employees-about-ai-and-future-of-company-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533420/" data-ref-id="1100-6533420">mass layoffs</a>, partnership with Israel, and investments in AI, among other things.</p><p>Nadella is paid a $2.5 million salary, a figure that's been the same since 2019. The majority of his pay for fiscal 2025 came from stock awards, making up $84.2 million (87%) of his total pay. Microsoft revealed all of this as part of a regulatory filing disclosed this week, as reported by <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-pay-soars-to-almost-100-million-for-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Seattle Times.</a></p><p>Nadella also makes money from an annual cash bonus--for this latest fiscal year, Nadella got paid a bonus of $9.56 million. The bonus he got last year--$5.2 million--was millions less than this year. That's because he requested a lower cash bonus for 2024 due in part to cyberattacks against Microsoft.</p><p>The median pay for a Microsoft employee, excluding Nadella's pay, rose in fiscal 2025 to $200,972, up from $193,744. At the same time, the delta between Nadella's pay and the median Microsoft salary is growing, reaching 480-to-1 for fiscal 2025--that's up from 250-to-1 in 2023.</p><p>The regulatory filing revealing Nadella's latest pay included a memo from Microsoft's board of directors saying the CEO's efforts to <a href="https://x.com/andrewrsorkin/status/1950717933774385623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push on artificial intelligence</a> helped Microsoft's fortunes overall in the latest fiscal year. "His leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift," the board said.</p><p>Microsoft reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">$4 trillion market cap this year</a> and the company's stock also reached an all-time high of more than $535 earlier this year. Microsoft is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 most valuable company in the world right now</a>, only trailing Nvidia.</p><p>Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, taking over for Steve Ballmer. He is just the third CEO of Microsoft, following Bill Gates and Ballmer. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft's stock price has risen from about $36 in 2014 to more than $520 today, an increase of more than 1,300%.</p><p>Recently, Microsoft made headlines again over a report that said CFO Amy Hood has implemented a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">new profit-margin mandate for Xbox of 30%, which is well above industry standards.</a> Many have theorized that this reported mandate has contributed to some of the decisions Microsoft has made in recent times, including bringing its first-party games to rival platforms, raising prices on consoles and Game Pass, investing in automation technologies with AI, canceling games, closing studios, and laying off workers.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sources told Bloomberg</a> that Microsoft will look to focus on producing titles that are "cheap to make" or more likely to generate revenue as opposed to "riskier bets."</p><p>Microsoft will publish its next earnings report on October 29, at which time the company's financial fortunes for the latest quarter will be revealed.</p>

The upcoming sequel--from Kirby and Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai--will have online demo sessions during two different weekends next month: November 8-9 and 15-16.</p><p dir="ltr">Called the Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride, the online demo will offer the Air Ride and City Trial modes. Air Ride is traditional racing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">"basically Mario Kart,"</a> according to Sakurai. There will be three different courses to check out: Floria Fields, Waveflow Waters, and Mount Amberfalls. Meanwhile, City Trial sees players prepping for battle in a hub area in the first phase (gathering power-ups and upgrading your vehicle) and then competing in the second phase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo notes that the special demo software for Kirby Air Riders can be downloaded starting November 7. Outside of the online play test times, players can have a go at Lessons in Kirby Air Riders. So basically, practicing at the game is possible before the first play test begins on November 8.</p><p dir="ltr">Another detail highlighted for the online demo by Nintendo relates to eShop preorders for Kirby Air Riders. The company states that digital purchasers of the Switch 2 exclusive will get to wear a special hat for the Global Test Ride, but the cosmetic won't be available in the full game.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai presented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-game/2900-7166/">an hourlong Nintendo Direct for Kirby Air Riders</a> earlier today. The developer stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-wont-have-dlc-sakurai-confirms/1100-6535652/">the Switch 2 exclusive won't have DLC</a>, for instance, while also introducing the Road Trip campaign and return of Top Ride. Kirby Air Riders is set to launch November 20.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride times are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 9, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 16, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li></ul>

<p>The plan is to automate Krafton's work around Agentic AI and fully implement AI-centered management systems. This should allow its employees to focus on creative activities and complex problems rather than, presumably, being hindered by menial tasks.</p><p>Agentic AI may sound new, but it has been around for a minute. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">defined by IBM</a>, it's an artificial intelligence that can accomplish tasks with little to no human intervention or supervision. Think of self-driving cars, autonomous ticketing services, and cybersecurity systems. Agentic AI isn't as ubiquitous as generative AI, but the technology is more widely used than you think.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Krafton has announced through the today's press release their mid-to-long term plan to turn into a "AI First" company.<br>The "AI First" strategy is set to be centered on Agentic AI - AI that sets goals and plans and works with external tools to execute complex task automation -… <a href="https://t.co/6Q7ejGQehu" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Q7ejGQehu</a></p>  — Patryk (@pattrick_36) <a href="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>What, then, does "AI-first" mean for Kraffton? As Changhan said in the Google Translated press release, this is a strategy meant to prioritize AI as the primary means of solving problems and increasing productivity while "accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth."</p><p>In addition to pouring nearly $70 million into AI as the de facto problem-solver for every aspect of the business going forward, Krafton intends to invest 30 billion KRW (or roughly $21 million) annually starting in 2026 to support its employees' use of various AI tools for their work. While that's a future commitment, Krafton intends to fully integrate this "AI-first" strategy this year.</p><p>This hard pivot toward AI comes at a troubling time for the technology sector. A smattering of companies and developers--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Hideo Kojima</a>--are embracing AI, while spending on the technology is expected to hit $375 billion this year and forecasted to reach $500 billion in 2026. Some analysts believe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the AI bubble is about the burst</a>, but none of that seems to be stopping megacorporations from opening their coffers wide.</p>
