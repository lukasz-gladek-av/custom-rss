                <p>Switch 2 owners who purchased Dbrand's Killswitch have been reporting that their Joy-Con 2s detach from the console relatively easily once their controllers have been wrapped in the protective cover. Several users have claimed that the magnetic connection is weakened by the Killswitch case, but Dbrand is preparing to address this as it says anyone suffering from the "manufacturing tolerance issue" can reach out to the company and get a free set of replacement Joy-Con 2 Grips.</p><p>Dbrand originally acknowledged this issue <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1lhvtyw/killswitch_joycon_detachment_update/" rel="nofollow ">in a Reddit post that wasn't too well-received</a>, as it acknowledged an air gap that's crucial in creating resistance between console and controller was filled when the Killswitch was added. Because the lip on the Killswitch eliminated the buffer that was designed to absorb movement between the console and controller--which is needed to create a fulcrum point when you remove the Joy-Con 2s--several users had begun reporting that their console detached from the controllers far too easily.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When holding the Switch 2 in a specific way, detachment between the Joy-Con 2s and [the] remainder of the console can occur," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/1ljlhwy/joycon_detachment_update_part_2_were_fixing_it/" rel="nofollow ">Dbrand explained</a>. "Some experience this issue. Some do not. This discrepancy is due to a manufacturing tolerance issue on the retaining lip that keeps the Joy-Con Grip attached to the Joy-Con. Anyone who suffers from the manufacturing tolerance issue can reach out and we'll get them better Joy-Con Grips in July. One nuanced point that got a bit lost in the prior update was that there <em>is</em> an alternative to the retaining lip. It's been tested and is already in-market on a few Switch 2 cases. It's adhesive. The problem with adhesive is that, given enough time or the wrong kind of stress, it will ultimately fail."</p><p>In our own testing, we did manage to replicate the issue with the Killswitch that several Switch 2 owners have experienced. The catch here is that this did require us to have our Switch 2 held at very specific angles to properly replicate, and we needed to apply some considerable force to the console as well.</p><p>While this appears to be an issue that some people are experiencing, the updated version will still be worth grabbing, as the Killswitch does offer some of the best ergonomic support, thanks to its design when compared to competitors like Satisfye and JSAUX. The Killswitch offers ridges for your fingers to rest in, resulting in a comfortable and natural grip.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dbrands-nintendo-switch-2-killswitch-grip-is-up-for-preorder/1100-6532032/" data-ref-id="1100-6532032">Check out our previous story on the Killswitch</a> for more details about the grip, including the unique dock adapter, optional travel cover, and bundle options.</p>

Now, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S owners are getting their chance to play I Am Your Beast.</p><p>On June 25, I Am Your Beast will officially go live on PSN and Xbox Live. In the game’s story, Harding has left his life of espionage and action behind him, even when his former employers at the Covert Operations Initiative try to entice him back for one final mission. When Harding turns down COI, it responds by sending countless agents to put him in an early grave. As you might expect, Harding takes that personally, and he's the wrong guy to mess with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mWOwtXZW8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/58mWOwtXZW8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The newly released ports include I Am Your Beast's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-years-best-games-just-added-nine-more-levels-for-free/1100-6527982/" data-ref-id="1100-6527982">free expansion</a>, which was released last November. Nine new levels were added to the game, as well as an epilogue that gave players even more ridiculously over-the-top action. The epilogue is taken from the accounts of the few COI agents who managed to survive Harding's wrath, and in their retelling he has superhuman abilities that break the laws of reason and physics.</p><p>I Am Your Beast was ported to iOS earlier this year without the added features that were included in the expansion. However, the mobile version of the game is also receiving a major update that will make it "feature-complete" with all of the material included with its PC and console ports. But on any platform, it's one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">the best shooters to play in 2025</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft releases its own first-party Xbox games on Game Pass at launch, but Sony does not do this--and it's not planning to change that strategy going forward.</p><p>PlayStation services executive Nick Maguire told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/playstation-plus-15th-anniversary-interview-ghost-of-tsushima" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a> that Sony has "stayed true to our strategy across the board," and that means no day-one new releases on PS Plus. "We're not looking to put games in day and date," Maguire said.</p><p>Back in 2022, PlayStation boss Jim Ryan--who has since left the company--said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">"virtuous cycle"</a> of Sony's business plans for gaming would be "broken" if Sony launched its new games into PS Plus.</p><p>"The level of investment that we need to make in our studios would not be possible, and we think the knock-on effect on the quality of the games that we make would not be something that gamers want."</p><p>The cycle, as Ryan described it is that, "the investment delivers success, which enables yet more investment, which delivers yet more success."</p><p>However, Ryan also acknowledged at the time that Sony wasn't married to this idea and would be open to changing its stance based on market conditions. In the three years since Ryan said this, however, Sony has not changed its stance, and the new comments from Maguire make it sound like it's not changing soon.</p><p>Also in the Game File interview, Maguire was asked if Sony's ill-fated live-service shooter Concord may have fared better had it been released on PS Plus at launch. Maguire declined to comment on that game specifically, but he said PS Plus has "proven itself to be a great way to introduce new players to franchises."</p><p>Maguire said the calculus comes down to finding the "right time" for a game to enter PS Plus to help it reach a wider audience after its initial debut. This could help a game "find new fans" or reach "new parts of our platform that it hasn't already reached," he said.</p><p>While Sony doesn't plan to launch its own games into PS Plus day-and-date, the company is partnering with third-party studios to debut new titles into the subscription service. FBC: Firebreak was a recent example of this. Going forward, Maguire said Sony aims to find four or five games each year to launch into PS Plus day-and-date, with Sony's own games coming to the service after a year, 18 months, or longer.</p><p>"That balance for us is working really well across the platform," Maguire said, adding that the four-to-five day-one third-party games each year is not a strict number but a ballpark estimate.</p>
