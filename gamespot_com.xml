                <p>Thanksgiving isn't traditionally the time for receiving gifts, but that's not stopping Digital Extremes from doing a giveaway of its own. The developer behind Warframe is offering its 2008 third-person shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dark-sector-review/1900-6188387/" data-ref-id="1900-6188387">Dark Sector</a> for free, but you only have until November 30 to claim it.</p><p>Digital Extremes shared the announcement on X, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/29900/Dark_Sector" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dark Sector's page on Steam</a> where the game is temporarily yours for the taking.</p><p>Digital Extremes credits Dark Sector for inspiring Warframe, and the game was initially released on PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. The story puts players in control of covert operative Hayden Tenno as he embarks on a mission behind enemy lines in the Eastern European nation of Lasria. He'll soon discover that there's a deadly secret that leaves him infected by a bio-weapon called the Technocyte Virus.</p><p>Ordinarily, the Technocyte virus turns its victims into mindless killing machines. Hayden avoided that fate--for now at least--and he's been left with superhuman abilities that may give him the edge if he wants to make it out of Lasria alive.</p><p>During the summer, Digital Extremes offered up a preview for Warframe's next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-1999-looks-like-the-party-of-a-lifetime/1100-6526024/" data-ref-id="1100-6526024">Warframe: 1999</a>. The story thrusts players on an alternate Earth, and it looks very intriguing so far. Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframes-developer-partners-with-make-a-wish-to-feature-child-in-upcoming-expansion/1100-6525153/" data-ref-id="1100-6525153">Digital Extremes granted a child's Make-A-Wish</a> to be a voice actor in the upcoming expansion when it arrives later this year.</p><p>If you're looking for more recent games and big sales, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tons-of-popular-pc-games-are-discounted-for-black-friday/1100-6527990/" data-ref-id="1100-6527990">check out our Black Friday roundup</a>!</p>
