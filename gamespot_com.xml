                <p>After a nearly 10-year gap between games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> finally arrived at the end of October. While the previous game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review/1900-6416222/" data-ref-id="1900-6416222">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, is now regarded as a classic in the genre, The Veilguard's reception has been considerably colder from some. That's something that the developers behind The Veilguard have already come to terms with.</p><p>"It's been a decade since the last Dragon Age game came out, and a lot of people have spent that decade imagining various versions of what this game was going to be," said Dragon Age creative director John Epler during an interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "The reality was whatever we came out with, it was never going to match the Dragon Age 4 in people's minds and people's imaginations."</p><p>The long development of The Veilguard included a period where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-boss-discusses-ditching-live-service-and-multiplayer-focus-for-the-veilguard/1100-6527540/" data-ref-id="1100-6527540">the sequel was re-envisioned as a live-service game</a> before it transitioned back to a single-player experience. Given everything that went into the game, director Corinne Busche shared her satisfaction with The Veilguard in its final form.</p><p>"We're very happy with the critical reception to the game," said Busche. "It's not common to have these challenging development cycles and have a team turn around and receive the critical reception that it did. In fact, in a lot of ways, that is the harder path to take. So yeah, we're quite proud of the critical reception. Unfortunately on the sales side, that's not something we can really discuss. but of course as we know with Inquisition, that was a long burn to get to those total sales numbers."</p><p>EA has already stated that The Veilguard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">won't be getting a DLC expansion</a> because BioWare is shifting gears to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. However, Busche expressed confidence in the future of the Dragon Age franchise.</p><p>"There's so many stories left, so many mysteries left unsolved, so I'll leave that for what it is," related Busche. "I will remain of the point of view that [Dragon Age's ability to reinvent itself] remains our greatest challenge and our greatest opportunity."</p>

future, but the team decided it was best to stick to the 2024 release date. The decision was influenced in part by the sheer level of exhaustion experienced by the game's developers, who endured multiple "marathon" crunch sessions to make sure the game was the best it could be, without resorting to another delay.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's very hard to explain your [mental] state when you're in a very intensive work process for many months until release, and you're working over, over, over what you usually can do, and [you're doing it] in the highest possible stress and overwhelming period," Grygorovych said of the race to finish the game while dealing with the constant strife of the ongoing war in Ukraine, where GSC was originally headquartered.</p><p dir="ltr">He added that he was surprised to see how much of Stalker 2's media coverage glossed over the fact that it was made in the midst of war, but instead focused more on standard details like patch notes, as if nothing were happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's something so unimportant in the scale of the country, but they were talking about the game!" he said of the coverage.</p><p dir="ltr">Stalker 2's development was heavily impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. GSC offices were damaged by a fire caused by Russian shelling, and the dev team ultimately had to make the difficult decision to leave their homes in Ukraine to finish work on the sequel to their most iconic title.</p><p dir="ltr">The war's impact can even be seen in the title of the game--while the original Stalker used the Russian spelling of the title (Shadow of Chernobyl), Stalker 2 has changed the spelling to reflect the Ukrainian pronunciation of Chornobyl. The devs even created a documentary about the struggle to develop a game set one's home country when that country is being ravaged by war.</p><p dir="ltr">Early in the invasion, Russian forces even occupied Pripyat--the city in which Stalker and Stalker 2 are set--and defaced the nuclear accident site along with the surrounding area. The city of Pripyat is now back under Ukrainian control, but the <a href="https://youtu.be/28CITqxwNz0?si=RE4PKuM3PZwi8kjd" rel="nofollow ">War Game: The Making of Stalker 2</a> documentary gives viewers a closer look at the difficulties, complications, and heartbreaks they dealt with during the game's development cycle. Gyrgorovych says half of the development team moved to Prague, while the other half remained in Kyiv. Employee safety was (and remains) a constant concern, and GSC devs yearn for the country they spent so long making games about.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4409796"></a><figcaption>At one point Russian forces invaded the radioactive city in which the Stalker series is set.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4409796-pripyat%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"It's very important to remind people what's going on [in Ukraine], because when there is something evil and you stop calling it out and mentioning it... it won't help to stop it," Gyrgorovych said. "One layer is we are making the game, and we want to entertain people and make it as good a game as possible. And second, it's about what we can do for our homeland, because we are in a hard situation. I would love to stay in my country and live in my country and make games in my country, but it's nearly impossible now."</p><p dir="ltr">Although Grygorovych was a bit surprised by the media's failure to acknowledge the cultural context of the game's creation, his wife Mariia--who also works at the studio--was delighted by the response from players in their home country. Ukrainian players signed into the game en masse after its release, leading to nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'" Marii said of the response from Ukrainian players. "It touched everyone in the country."</p><p dir="ltr">"For us and our team what's most important is, for some people in Ukraine, they feel a little bit happier [now] than they were before [the game's] release," she added. "We did something for our home country, something good for them.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's not perfect, we need to fix everything, it has some problems. But it's a game! It's a game with soul, with feelings there, with love there. Even the problems--you can't fix them if you don't have a game."</p>

                <p>BioWare is celebrating Dragon Age Day with a handful of surprises for fans centered around the recently released Dragon Age: The Veilguard, but also recognizes what's come before. A standalone version of Veilguard's character creator and a free armor set for the game inspired by Dragon Age II are both now available. Later today, the game will have a new update and you can see the full patch notes for Patch 4 below, which includes a new tool to take photos during the game's cutscenes, 20+ bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions. </p><p>Dragon Age Day was created by the game's fans to give Dragon Age its own version of N7 Day, the day that celebrates the community of BioWare's space epic series, Mass Effect. </p><p>The biggest gift to players is a standalone, free version of the game's character creator. For the folks who haven't taken the plunge into Dragon Age: The Veilguard, you can now create a Rook or Inquisitor, before buying the full game and transferring your character over. You just need to make sure you're on the same platform that you have the creator on.</p><p>There will also be the addition of Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke's armor, body paint, and nose blood smear as free cosmetics for your character. These cosmetics are a permanent addition to the game, and can be found in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing The Singing Blade mission.</p><p>Speaking of community, since Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been out for over a month, developers will start an AMA over at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Age subreddit</a> starting at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET today, December 4.. Previous AMAs were on its <a href="https://fortyseven-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/2Xi6_oaezhq-pyYHW_g3OuOf1NGn6h6AvWUBtrSoR2cuq53uSkwFZEM8cqxaGSvHBtt966xQ835h7_ywaqJ3hI5vsIfUaruPEhsh5qYr7KoQ3mK8b_np2BmN78AI6f0tnhQBcySqfo5VuS_GJsKSsjYWNbJSJ4jTXAqQAe-CfWczpSIZkbdOmug" rel="nofollow ">BioWare Discord</a>, so if players want to check out the past questions and answers before hopping into today’s session, head over there.</p><h3>Patch 4 Notes: </h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue that prevented some saves from loading properly.

Sega's Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii was originally slated for a February 28 release, <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-reason/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">but was pushed up to February 21</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a new Zombies map arriving in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> on December 5, and Treyarch has released a short video to give players a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the French-inspired location. The video discusses the design choices and gives a better glimpse at the new Doppelghast enemy type.</p><p dir="ltr">Citadelle des Morts is a castle in France overrun with the undead. Treyarch says Zombies mode has plenty of maps "grounded in science fiction," and for this map, it wanted to lean more into magic. Citadelle des Morts also features elemental sword Wonder Weapons. This sounds similar to Black Ops 3's Der Eisendrache map, which was a snowy castle map with elemental bows. However, Treyarch says it has never featured a castle like Citadelle des Morts, as this new design lets players travel further into the claustrophobic bowels of the castle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtKXep999Gc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WtKXep999Gc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch also pulls back the curtain on the making of the Doppelghast, which is the map's unique special enemy. This creature has two heads and tentacle-like appendages instead of arms, and the developer says it wanted to design the enemy to be as unsettling as possible. The Doppelghast is also described as being "super fast and in your face," and the creature's hasty movement can be seen in the video above.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make it have a diverse attitude, where the two heads are constantly looking for something, but they have a separate mind," says Anthony Dicenzo, who is Treyarch's lead animator for Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">The video also shows off more of the map's unique traps that are designed around the castle theme. This includes hot oil traps that can be lit on fire and magical runes that help protect players.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says players will have secrets to uncover within the castle when the map goes live. This will include the main storyline Easter egg quest, but if Citadelle des Morts is anything like the previous two maps, there will likely be plenty of side quests to discover as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Citadelle des Morts's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/" data-ref-id="1100-6528064">story trailer can be seen here</a>.

The digital version costs $60 on the PlayStation Store, Xbox Store, and Steam, so Amazon's $40 price likely won't be available for long. Of course, there's a chance Amazon will cancel preorders placed at the $40 price.</p><p>Bleach Rebirth of Souls releases March 21, 2025, on PS5, Xbox Series X |S, and PC. Based on the popular anime, this latest entry in the Bleach series is a fast-paced 3D fighting game with swordfighting combat.</p><p>Developed by Tamsoft Corporation and published by Bandai Namco, Rebirth of Souls has local and online multiplayer as well as a single-player campaign designed for both veterans and series newcomers. The story is a retelling of the manga and anime from the beginning, so no prior knowledge of Bleach will be needed to follow along.</p>
