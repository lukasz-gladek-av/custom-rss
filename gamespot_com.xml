                <p>Akira Yamaoka, best known for his decades-spanning contributions to the Silent Hill series, is bringing his talents to an upcoming horror game from the creators of Turbo Overkill. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/total-chaos/" data-ref-id="5000-626760">Total Chaos</a> is scheduled to arrive later this year, and GameSpot can exclusively reveal both Yamaoka's involvement and his theme song for the game, "Catharsis." Listen to the song's world premiere below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guO_QkSFOTE" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/guO_QkSFOTE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Total Chaos was born as a mod for Doom 2, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos" rel="nofollow ">originally released</a> in 2018. The forthcoming adaptation from Trigger Happy Interactive and Apogee Entertainment is a complete reimagining of that source material on a new engine. Yamaoka is working with the mod's original composer, Jason Dagenet, to bring the game's music to life. As any Silent Hill fan would know, the debut track definitely carries the composer's signature sound.</p><p>In the first-person horror game, players can expect to find the touchstones of the survival-horror genre, such as resource management, crafting survival equipment, and a parade of monsters that bring their own behaviors and attacks to worry about.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's Steam page</a>, mysterious radio transmissions will guide the protagonist across the shifting locale of Fort Oasis, as the character sets out to confront his own "fractured past." It sounds like more than just the music will appeal to Silent Hill fans.</p><p>There's no announced release date for Total Chaos just yet, but players can expect to learn about that soon, as the game remains on track for a 2025 launch.</p>
