                <p>Activision has announced more details around Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 that speak to the game's popularity, though the publisher has not disclosed a sales number for the title as of yet.</p><p>In a statement, Activision said Black Ops 6 is now the "biggest Call of Duty ever" over its first 30 days when it comes to total players, total hours played, and total matches played. Before this, Activision said Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/#:~:text=Black%20Ops%206%20Had%20A,500%20Million%20Units%20Sold%20-%20GameSpot" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">broke records for the same categories over its first three days.</a></p><p>Developer Treyarch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861096257374056822" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thanked fans for their support</a> and announced that a double XP weekend for Black Ops 6 will begin this Wednesday, November 27. That's a few days before the actual weekend, but Treyarch is no doubt kicking things off early due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the US.</p><p>In addition to double XP, Black Ops 6 is adding new multiplayer playlists on November 27. These include Prop Hunt, Stakeout 24/7, and Hardcore Stakeout 24/7.</p><p>Big numbers for Black Ops 6 were expected prior to launch. Not only is the Black Ops brand highly popular, but the game launched into Game Pass, opening the game up to a potentially larger playerbase. Experts say it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-helped-playstation/1100-6527989/" data-ref-id="1100-6527989">too soon to understand the full impact of Black Ops 6 launching into Game Pass, though.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">economic realities of Game Pass may never become clear</a>, in part because Microsoft will not publicly share the terms of its deals with developers and publishers. At a higher level, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-microsoft-doesnt-share-xbox-one-sales-numbers/1100-6435219/" data-ref-id="1100-6435219">doesn't even disclose Xbox console sales numbers anymore</a>, as the company instead focuses on ambiguous "engagement" metrics that can be spun and positioned to Microsoft's benefit.</p><p>Black Ops 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/" data-ref-id="2900-5979">No. 1 best-selling game of October 2024 in the US</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">2024's No. 3 best-selling game overall after just a few days on sale.</a></p>

                <p>The Xbox Avatar Editor, first introduced during the Xbox One era, will shut down on January 9, 2025, Microsoft has announced. However, Xbox 360 Avatars will stick around.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft announced the news via a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">support page</a>, stating players will no longer be able to use or access the Xbox Avatar Editor come the beginning of next year. Those who made any purchases for their avatar in the last year (since November 1, 2023), will automatically be refunded for those purchases. Those who use their avatar for their Xbox Gamerpic will continue to be able to do so, but will be unable to update it via the Xbox Avatar Editor come January 9.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the reason behind the shutdown, Microsoft said it is due to "low engagement" and the company's "shift in focus to delivering other player experiences."</p><p dir="ltr">The good news is that Xbox 360 Avatars (or Xbox Original Avatars, as they are officially called now) will still be accessible. These avatars were first introduced in 2008 for the Xbox 360 before being carried forward to Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S and are actually used for some Xbox 360 games--mostly Xbox Live Arcade titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/1-vs-100-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-38067">1 vs.100</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/a-kingdom-for-keflings/" data-ref-id="5000-35399">A Kingdom for Keflings</a>, or the marketing-stunt-turned-video-game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doritos-crash-course/" data-ref-id="5000-91756">Doritos Crash Course</a>. They can also still be used as Gamerpics and customized via the Xbox Original Avatars app on consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Xbox 360 Avatars found some popularity due to their Nintendo Mii-like appearance, the modern iteration of avatars added for Xbox One never seemed to find its footing, and has long been an afterthought. Microsoft emphasized on its support page that despite Xbox Avatars getting the axe, players can still personalize and customize their Xbox experience in other ways, like with dynamic backgrounds, custom Gamerpics, and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> is a good time to stock up on some new hardware, and if you've been looking to grab a new PC monitor, you can get an <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2F5481444012%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Acer Nitro 27-inch display at Walmart</a> for $109. That's a very decent price for a monitor that would be ideal for a workhorse device, so if you've been looking to create a multi-monitor setup at home that won't cost an arm and a leg, this is an affordable option. The catch here is that the deal will be open first to <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart+ subscribers</a> starting 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET on November 25, and if it doesn't sell out, the special will be available to the general public starting at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4404848"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4404848-acer-nitro-2.jpg"></figure><p>Given that this monitor typically sells for around $160, we're not expecting the stock to be around for long, as Walmart offered something similar last year and it sold out very quickly. The good news is that <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-this-27-inch-acer-monitor-for-109-during-black-friday%2F1100-6528010%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart+ has been discounted for Black Friday</a>, as you can get a one-year membership for $48, which is a 50% savings. There's also a free-trial-period option available if you just want to hop in for a quick bargain, but the overall membership is pretty good. It gets you exclusive early access to deals like this, free shipping, a Paramount+ subscription, and several more perks that make it worthwhile.</p><p>For this curved monitor, you're getting a good all-rounder at this price. It has a 180Hz refresh rate, up to 250 Nits of brightness, and a 1080p resolution. This makes it ideal for run-of-the-mill work, or if you're looking to set up a PC gaming space for a younger family member, it's a solid monitor to play games like Fortnite or Valorant on.</p><p>Alternatively, you can get some big discounts on high-end ultrawide monitors for Black Friday. You won't need a multi-monitor setup with one of these, as they're big enough to easily display web browsers and apps simultaneously, and one of the standout deals here is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CP6HW894?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung Odyssey G9</a> 49-inch monitor.

                <p>The modding community for Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive one, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/"> with Larian officially embracing mods</a>, the game has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/"> more players than ever</a>. However, how many mods for a single game is too many? Larian was looking through stats, and apparently, players with 100+ mods aren't that uncommon, but this poses a bit of a problem for gameplay, so the studio is putting its foot down for console players.</p><p>Larian announced that it is issuing a 100-mod limit to console players for the sake of gameplay to avoid any other possible disasters. In the statement, the studio broke down why it imposed the limit and what to do if you already have exceeded the limit.</p><p>"Unlike PC, consoles can only juggle so many files at once. The more mods you have installed, the quicker this file limit is reached. Now that some of you have been trying to play with more than 100 mods, you've been letting us know that you're experiencing slow loading times or even game crashes," the <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-29-now-live-console-only_127" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement read</a>. "While we recommend only installing the mods you know you'll definitely continue playing with, to [maximize] stability, we’re introducing a 100-mod limit for console platforms. This change comes in today's console-only hotfix that introduces the limit, and depending on how many mods you already have installed, you may see different messaging when you next load your game."</p><p>The statement continued explaining if you have more than 100 mods, you won't be able to play on a console for the time being, but cross-saves on PC and console should be fine. The statement warns players may have to disable a number of mods from their PC so they can access the cross-save. However, another update is coming to give players access to those saves.</p><p>"We'll be shipping another fix soon that will aim to give you the means to access console saves that are disabled after today's update," Larian continued.
