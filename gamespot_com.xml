                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> continues to pay tribute to Mats "Ibelin" Steen, the subject of the recent Netflix documentary The Remarkable Life of Ibelin, this time transforming Steen's character into a full-fledged NPC.</p><p dir="ltr">As spotted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/lord-ibelin-redmoore-new-tribute-npc-to-mats-ibelin-steen-in-patch-11-1-359767" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, dataminers have discovered an NPC by the name of Lord Ibelin Redmoore on the public test realm for the MMORPG's upcoming 11.1 update. The NPC's appearance matches Ibelin's look in the documentary, though it's currently unclear where players will be able to find Ibelin in-game or what he might have to say should players interact with him.</p><p dir="ltr">Steen suffered from Duchenne muscular dystrophy and played WoW as a means of socializing and connecting with others. His character Ibelin, who he often roleplayed as, labeled himself as a private investigator and would use his in-game job title as a means to strike up conversation.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not the first time Blizzard has paid tribute to Steen, who passed away in 2014. He is also honored in-game with a gravestone in Elwynn Forest. Blizzard more recently offered the Reven Pack, a bundle of cosmetics (including an adorable fox in a detective hat) inspired by Steen. All of the proceeds from the Reven Pack went to support the charity CureDuchenne.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-remarkable-life-of-ibelin-review-the-real-warcraft-movie/1900-6418311/" data-ref-id="1900-6418311">The Remarkable Life of Ibelin review</a>, we called the documentary (much of which is actually an animated film using WoW's game engine) a "vivid rendition of a virtual life" and "a powerful real-life story on the positive impact gaming can have on people's lives."</p><p dir="ltr">As for what's next for Blizzard's MMO, the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-within-next-major-update-is-going-full-goblin-mode/1100-6527723/" data-ref-id="1100-6527723">11.1 update will go all-in on goblins</a> while also introducing customizable hot rods for players to drive and drift their way through the game's new Undermine zone. Blizzard recently announced as part of a Warcraft 30th anniversary steam that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">WoW will also finally be getting player housing</a>, though players will have to wait until the game's next expansion, Midnight, for the highly anticipated feature.</p>

                <p>Palworld developer Pocketpair has launched a new game on Nintendo Switch despite the fact that it's currently being sued by The Pokemon Company and Nintendo.</p><p>The game is called <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/overdungeon-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoos3obFA-NfyheoYr7x1zhWAMRHgsTk0y19B5K0LzQvxU8DamXK" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overdungeon</a>, which combines card game, tower defense, and roguelike elements. It has real-time gameplay with cards featuring various animals like cats, dogs, and alpacas. It was first released in 2019 for PC before its surprise launch on Switch today, January 9.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7SXW2eXG2E" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_7SXW2eXG2E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Pokemon Company sued Pocketpair last year, alleging that the Pocketpair engaged in infringement on The Pokemon Company's patents. Pocketpair <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">revealed</a> that the three Japanese patents were centered around the mechanics of throwing balls at creatures to catch them, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>In December, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/493584/palworld-update-pokemon-nintendo-pokeball-lawsuit-patent" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">removed the balls</a>, called Pal Spheres, that the creatures come out from when the spheres are thrown. Instead, the creatures just appear alongside the player when summoned.</p><p>The status of the lawsuit is still pending, and it's unclear how it impacts the two companies' relationship. However, it seems like it won't stop Pocketpair from releasing games on Nintendo's platform.</p>

                <p>As part its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-to-march-20/1100-6528717/" data-ref-id="1100-6528717">delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, Ubisoft has <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1wUjJWUQSIVMlZbKQ2707e/c0b1cd1c71ab30838e51d5e24764577f/Press_release_09_01_2025_vfinal.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it's putting plans in place to pursue "various transformational strategic and capitalistic options" to help put itself in the best possible financial situation. Ubisoft said it has appointed an advisory team to do this.</p><p>Ubisoft said it will continue to "drive significant cost reductions" as part of this plan, though the company did not say if more layoffs are coming. Ubisoft added that it will take a "highly selective approach to investments" during this period. In total, Ubisoft said it expects to see a reduction of €200 million ($206 million USD) as part of this plan.</p><p>Looking ahead, Ubisoft said it expects Q3 FY2024-25 revenue to be less than what it originally forecast, due in part to lower-than-expected game sales during the holiday, mainly due to an underperformance of Star Wars Outlaws. The downturn is also attributed in part to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">discontinuation of XDefiant. </a></p><p>During a conference call, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot said he sees "several potential paths" for the company and its franchises going forward to maximize shareholder value. It was previously reported that Ubisoft was considering numerous different possibilities for its future, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">selling to Tencent.</a></p><p>On the call, Ubisoft declined to comment on the report of the company potentially selling to Tencent, but management said it is "exploring different options," adding, "We can't say more."</p><p>Also during the call, management said it was "the difficult but right decision" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">close XDefiant and shut down multiple studios around the world</a>, adding that it's learned lessons from XDefiant's lack of success in the market.</p>
