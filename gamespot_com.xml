                <p>Recently, voice actor Doug Cockle revealed that Geralt would be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, but he's now walking back those comments after he was "slapped" by developer CD Projekt Red for saying anything in the first place. At the MCM Comic Con Birmingham event recently, Cockle said his original comments were based on "a rumor," and he claims he doesn't know if Geralt will actually be in The Witcher 4.</p><p>"I did go online and I said something about this, and then I got slapped by CD Projekt because… I don't know how true it is," he said, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-may-not-have-geralt-after-all-his-actor-was-slapped-by-cd-projekt-for-accidentally-sharing-a-rumor-that-hed-be-in-it-just-not-as-the-protagonist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by GamesRadar</a>. "I went off a rumor--I thought I'd seen somebody from CD Projekt say that Geralt will be in Witcher 4 but he won't be the main character, and I don't actually know if that's true now, because they came back and they went, 'We haven't put anything out there, don't say anything!'"</p><p>Cockle went on to say he doesn't actually know what the story for The Witcher 4 is all about or if Geralt will feature in it. "Witcher 4 is a complete mystery to me," he said.</p><p>Back in August, Cockle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geralt-is-in-witcher-4-but-the-game-wont-focus-on-him/1100-6525728/" data-ref-id="1100-6525728">very matter-of-factly said</a>, "What we know is that Geralt will be part of the game. We just don't know how much, and the game won't focus on Geralt, so it's not about him this time." In the same interview, Cockle admitted he might be lying through his teeth about everything he said.</p><p>As for what the actual developers have said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-is-not-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-dev-says/1100-6522306/" data-ref-id="1100-6522306">The Witcher 4 won't just be "Witcher 3 in new clothing,"</a> according to CD Projekt Red joint-CEO Michał Nowakowski. More specifically, Nowakowski said to expect "new gameplay elements and new mechanics" that weren't a part of the original trilogy starring Geralt.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-has-more-than-400-people-working-on-it-full-production-begins-this-year/1100-6522263/" data-ref-id="1100-6522263">The Witcher 4 has over 400 people working on the game</a> and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">now in full production</a>.

                <p>Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-hearts-of-stone-review/1900-6416268/" data-ref-id="1900-6416268">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>, CD Projekt Red's smash hit that has spanned two console generations. Even during The Witcher 3's development, CD Projekt Red was paving the way for its futuristic follow-up title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Now, a new report suggests that The Witcher 3 almost had a direct crossover with Cyberpunk 2077 in a quest that would have temporarily sent Geralt of Rivia to Night City.</p><p>This revelation comes from a new eBook series, <a href="https://github.com/glassfish777/WhatLiesUnseen/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What Lies Unseen</a>, a multi-volume chronicle of the development of The Witcher 3 by modders and data miners Crygreg, Ferroxius, and Glassfish. According to the first volume of the book, the quest called Through Time and Space originally had Geralt and his ally, Avallac’h, appear in Cyberpunk 2077's Night City during their journey into the multiverse for answers about the Wild Hunt.</p><p>In one of the lost lines of dialogue, Avallac'h describes Night City as "technologically advanced, but broken... dying." Geralt initially wonders if the city is in the afterlife before expressing his disgust for the stench and the noise. Intriguingly, Geralt would have inadvertently left his mark on the city by giving some coins to a beggar who he took pity on. Those coins would have proven more valuable than Geralt realized, as the initial plan was reportedly for the character to reappear in Cyberpunk 2077 as a wealthy individual.</p><p>While that crossover didn't ultimately take place, Geralt has appeared in games outside The Witcher's universe including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-world-review-deadliest-catch/1900-6416842/" data-ref-id="1900-6416842">Monster Hunter: World</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/soulcalibur-6-review-the-new-legend/1900-6417012/" data-ref-id="1900-6417012">Soulcalibur 6</a>. Presumably Geralt will also return in some fashion in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which recently began its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">full-scale production</a>. That sequel may be several years away, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witchers-gwent-card-game-is-heading-to-the-real-world/1100-6528284/" data-ref-id="1100-6528284">a physical version of The Witcher's Gwent card game</a> will be released in 2025.</p>
