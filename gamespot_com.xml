                <p>During an investor presentation earlier today, Ubisoft showed off Teammates, a new R&amp;D game experience that utilizes generative AI. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot also described the advent of generative AI in games as "a revolution."</p><p>"Generative AI is as big a revolution for games as the shift to 3D," said Guillemot (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-delayed-results%20%20as%20the%20tech%20is%20embraced%20company%20wide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game File</a>). "We are making great strides in applying Gen AI to high-value use cases that bring tangible benefits to our players and teams... It's as big [of] a revolution for our industry as the shift to 3D. And we have everything to lead on this front."</p><p>Teammates was developed by the team behind Neo NPC. The company also said that the demo is meant to prove that "generative AI-driven gameplay can shape a new generation of more interactive and engaging games."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608845"></a><figcaption>A screencap from Teammates.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608845-teammatessofiaandpablo.jpg"></figure><p>The game's prototype is currently being tested by a small number of players. Teammates is a first-person shooter, but its AI tools will supposedly let it adapt to voice commands from the player, allowing NPCs to dynamically respond in real-time.</p><p>"It's really about experimenting with entirely new ways of creating interactive stories," said the game's narrative director, Virginie Mosser. "Our role is to give AI meaning, to narrativize it, ensuring logic doesn’t replace soul. We designed Teammates to leave space for player creativity, finding that balance between emotion and unpredictability."</p><p>Teammates includes a companion character called Jaspar who is said to be able to help the player overcome obstacles and provide hints or strategies. In concept, that's not very different from other NPCs in numerous games. What supposedly makes Jaspar stand out is his ability to interact and respond directly to the player.</p><p>The Teammates devs note that it has a specially made Application Programming Interface (API) that can utilize guardrails that shield players from AI-powered hallucinations and "helps control its power to put it at the service of human creativity and play." The company also characterized Teammates as an experiment that "serves both as a playable prototype and a testbed for the underlying technology."</p><p>Ubisoft has stated that its new "Creative Houses" operating model will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-posts-strong-first-half-growth-and-teases-major-creative-shake-up-coming-in-2026/1100-6536414/" data-ref-id="1100-6536414">unveiled in January 2026</a>. Earlier this week, Ubisoft apologized to players for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-promises-to-replace-ai-art-found-in-anno-117-pax-romana/1100-6536293/" data-ref-id="1100-6536293">including AI artwork in Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. The replacement image looks like the AI version, minus a few people with extra fingers or distorted faces.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/" data-ref-id="1100-6536356">new version of Nuketown arrived on November 20</a>, and one of the first things people tried on it was shooting off all the mannequin heads to unlock the long-running Nuketown Easter egg. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in Black Ops 7, at least not yet. This isn't a huge shock, though, as Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown didn't unlock the Easter egg right away, either.</p><p>A popular video from the Detonated account shows that the mannequin heads on Nuketown 2025 cannot be shot off, thereby not allowing the Easter egg to unlock once they're all blasted away. People are theorizing that the new version of Nuketown does indeed carry forward the Easter egg that's been in every version of Nuketown since 2010, but it's just not active yet.</p><p>In Black Ops 6, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-easter-egg-breathes-new-life-into-nuketown-in-the-creepiest-way-possible/1100-6527796/" data-ref-id="1100-6527796">zombified mannequins sprung forth from the ground</a> for the Easter egg. And <a href="https://screenrant.com/call-duty-black-ops-nuketown-easter-eggs-ranked/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as ScreenRant reminds us</a>, when Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown launched, it also didn't have the Easter egg unlocked, but it arrived around a week later. If the same pattern holds for Black Ops 7, fans can expect the latest version of the Easter egg to be here soon. Season 1 is expected to launch in early December, and this could be when the Easter egg gets unlocked for Black Ops 7, but that's just a guess.</p><p>The Nuketown Easter egg debuted with the first Black Ops game in 2010 and has showed up, in different forms, for every version of the map since. For the first game, shooting all the mannequin heads would trigger the game to start playing the Rolling Stones song "Sympathy for the Devil." In Black Ops 2, the Easter egg makes classic Activision games playable on an in-game sign.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, Treyarch made <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991220426618597519" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7's Endgame available to everyone</a> today, November 21. Before, players had to complete the campaign to unlock it. A new update just arrived, too, and it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-patch-notes-detail-aim-assist-change-drone-pod-nerf-and-smg-buffs/1100-6536440/" data-ref-id="1100-6536440">makes some aim-assist changes. </a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and, in a break from tradition, Activision's first-weekend social media post about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any mention of how the game is performing compared to past releases.</a></p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">GameSpot's Black Ops 7 review</a>.

Max, Steve, Nancy, Jonathan, and Robin apparently didn't make the cut.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Review - Strong Map Design Makes Multiplayer A Blast</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In the patch notes, Treyarch says the studio "slightly overshot" its target balance, and a small tuning change is made to reduce this aim-assist penalty from 35% to 25%.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal for this new mechanic and our other aim-assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs," the developer says. "Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it's crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals."</p><p dir="ltr">To help provide better balance with Black Ops 7's assault rifles and submachine guns, Treyarch has included a damage range buff across all submachine guns in the game, and all of the assault rifles will feature slightly increased flinch.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just the beginning of the weapon tuning players can expect in the coming weeks.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the game's powerful Drone Pod field upgrade is now nerfed with the following changes:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds</li><li dir="ltr">Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The update includes Zombies changes meant to improve the main Ashes of the Damned Easter egg experience for all players, including adjustments to the difficulty of the boss fight. The boss fight's Hoard Husk will now regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health, and the boss's missile barrage has reduced effectiveness. It also reduces damage to passengers riding in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-repair-and-upgrade-ol-tessie/1100-6536336/" data-ref-id="1100-6536336">Ol' Tessie</a> and removes the repair cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">To improve the Zombies quest for solo players, Zursa the zombie bear will no longer spawn in solo boss fights before round 100 and will have reduced speed.</p><p dir="ltr">This new update also unlocks the campaign's Endgame mode for all Black Ops 7 players to enjoy. Those who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">variety of Black Ops 7 rewards</a>. Black Ops 7 features double level XP, weapon XP, and GobbleGum earn rates from now until November 24.</p><p dir="ltr">The full Black Ops 7 patch notes can be found below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-preseason-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional multiplayer maps, and a brand-new Zombies map. Season 1's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-can-now-slay-zombies-in-space-thanks-to-new-cod-black-ops-7-zombies-map/1100-6536434/" data-ref-id="1100-6536434">Astra Malorum Zombies map trailer</a> reveals the fight against the undead is headed into space.</p><h2>BLACK OPS 7 GLOBAL</h2><h3>Aim Assist</h3><p>We intentionally took a big swing with our Aim Assist changes between Beta and Launch. Now that we've had time to collect data and player feedback, we're making a slight adjustment as we do with all aspects of gameplay over time to hit our targets and address the wide range of feedback.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched with a new right-stick aiming requirement for achieving maximum Rotational Aim Assist strength. When the right-stick isn’t used, or isn’t tracking a target effectively, players now experience a minimum Rotational Aim Assist strength. At launch, the minimum Rotational Aim Assist was a 35% reduction from the Beta. Our goal for this new mechanic and our other Aim Assist range changes is to provide the most competitive experience for all players and inputs. This slightly overshot our balance target, so we’re making a small tuning adjustment to the minimum Rotational Aim Assist.</p><p>Aim Assist is one of the most integral components of gameplay feel, so it’s crucial for us to settle on tuning that both feels great to play with and hits our balance goals. As always, we'll continue to closely examine game data and player feedback.</p><ul><li>Minimum Rotational Aim Assist penalty reduced from 35% to 25%.</li></ul><h3>Weapons</h3><p>We are pushing an early round of weapon tuning that aims at addressing some of the common pieces of feedback we have been seeing at launch. The main area of feedback has been SMG balance, particularly in relation to Assault Rifles. Most of our changes today aim to reduce the versatility of our highest performing ARs, and improve the mid-range performance of SMGs. You can find more details below. Aside from the SMGs, we have a handful of other individual weapon and prestige attachment adjustments. In general we really like the class variety we have been seeing so far.</p><p>This is just the beginning for weapon tuning in the opening weeks of Black Ops 7. We’ll be continuing to dial things in across weapons, prestige attachments, and the general attachment portfolio as we roll into our first season.</p><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><p>Assault Rifles are receiving a small flinch nerf so that they flinch harder than SMGs. This is not a huge adjustment, as we also don’t want to introduce lucky headshots into our full-auto gunfights. This flinch increase is small enough that it may affect players aiming for headshots and not well centered, but still not force most torso shots into headshots unintentionally.</p><p>Weapon Class Adjustment</p><ul><li>Received Flinch increased from .15N to .18N.</li></ul><h4>SMGs</h4><p>SMGs are receiving a similar list of buffs across the board. Baseline, they are all receiving an improvement to their final damage range to add a handful of meters to some of their mid-range power. In addition, multiple attachments are receiving substantial improvements to their damage range traits. Our goal here is to help SMGs to contend with ARs more effectively out into medium ranges, but also require some build investment to do so especially well. We still want players to make some choices between creating ultra-fast SMG builds and those that have higher range capabilities, but Gunfighter shouldn’t feel like a requirement.</p><p>Similarly, the Rear Grip attachments that improve recoil are seeing a buff. There’s a tough handling tradeoff when taking recoil in that node, so we felt there was room to push these further. A few of the SMGs are receiving additional, baseline improvements to recoil as well.</p><p>Overall, we think this will give SMGs a more solid footing in Black Ops 7. We’ll continue to fine tune to make sure both SMGs and ARs have a role to play across our map portfolio.</p><p><strong>Weapon Class Adjustment</strong></p><ul><li>Received Flinch reduced from 0.17N to 0.12N.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><p>The Warden 308 and M34 Novaline are both very high-power, precision weapons that we see doing very well so far in Black Ops 7. Our sentiment here is the same as the X9 Maverick, in that we are excited to have Marksman Rifles in the mix and want to keep it that way. For now we want to make sure there’s some counterplay to these weapons, and that playing aggressively with them requires attachment investment. Upping the flinch they receive and hitting the handling and mobility is the approach we’re taking for that.</p><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Increased viewable minimap area an additional 10% on top of previous 15% increase.</li></ul><h3>Field Upgrades</h3><ul><li>Drone Pod  <ul><li>Increased Drone Pod charge time from 2.5 to 3 minutes.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod active drone duration from 10 to 8 seconds.</li><li>Reduced Drone Pod damage from 60 to 50 damage.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Scorestreaks</h3><ul><li>Hand Cannon  <ul><li>Increased ammo for the Hand Cannon Akimbo Overlock from 5 to 7 rounds per gun; reduced hipfire spread by 44%.</li><li>Reduced ammo for the Hand Cannon Extended Mag Overclock from 12 to 10 rounds.</li></ul></li><li>LDBR  <ul><li>Increased missile count for the LDBR Second Strike Overclock from 9 to 13 missiles per target.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li>Adjusted FFA spawn influencer size for all maps to address bad spawn issues.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Kill enemies affected by your Tactical Equipment” to “Kill enemies affected by your Tactical or non-lethal Scorestreak”.</li></ul></li><li>Fixed an issue where the Popcorn Medal wasn’t being awarded when getting 2 or more kills with the Needle Drone or Semtex Lethal Equipment.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2><b>ZOMBIES</b></h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Ashes of the Damned</b><ul><li>Reduced difficulty for the Boss fight in Ashes of the Damned.  <ul><li>Hoard Husk will regenerate after a minute of collection and give 25% more health.</li><li>Missiles have reduced effectiveness and will no longer fire while a Beam Attack is charging.</li><li>Interrupting the Beam Attack no longer reduces its cooldown before round 100.</li><li>Reduced damage to passengers riding in Ol' Tessie and removed repair cooldown.</li><li>Increased cooldown on the boss ramming Ol' Tessie in its immune phase.</li><li>Zursa will no longer spawn in Solo before round 100 and has reduced speed.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Gameplay</h3><ul><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to stand on a light fixture at Vandorn Farm.</li><li>Closed an exploit that allowed players to block zombie pathing with Ol' Tessie.</li></ul><h3>UI</h3><ul><li>Addressed a rare issue when entering Ol’ Tessie that could cause the HUD to refresh or the boss to spawn without a health bar.</li></ul><h3>Challenges</h3><ul><li>Increased the amount of Dead Wire Ammo kills required to unlock the Pathfinder Camo for the DS20 Mirage from 5 to 300.</li><li>Changed the following camo challenge requirement:  <ul><li>“Get Kills shortly after using a Field Upgrade” to "Get Kills while a Field Upgrade is active”.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Various crash and stability updates.</li></ul><h2>CO-OP CAMPAIGN / ENDGAME</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Endgame is now available for all players who own Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</li></ul><h3>Loadouts</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where some attachments on weapon builds would not be present after loading into a match.</li></ul>

                <p>For years, Sony focused almost exclusively on releasing its games for PlayStation platforms, and while the company's focus remains in the console market, it has expanded to PC in recent years. A new report says Sony is having plenty of success with these efforts, with its PC releases thus far collectively bringing in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.</p><p>A <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Alinea Analytics</a> put forth this number, based on its own research. The best-selling PlayStation game on PC is Helldivers 2, the report said, selling more than 12.7 million copies.</p><p>In total, the report said Sony's five top-selling PC releases on Steam have passed 43 million copies sold collectively. The gross revenue from these sales reportedly amounted to $1.5 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for Sony and Valve's cut of $350 million or more. Valve takes a 30% cut of PC game sales on Steam, falling to 25% after $10 million in revenue and $20% after 50 million.</p><p>The report added that Helldivers 2 players are seriously engaged with the game, with a reported one-fifth of players logging more than 100 hours total. More than 200,000 people who own the game on Steam play it every day, the report said.</p><h2><strong>PlayStation's top-selling PC games on Steam</strong></h2><ul><li>Helldivers 2 -- 12.7 million</li><li>Horizon: Zero Dawn -- 4.5 million</li><li>God of War -- 4.2 million</li><li>Days Gone -- 3.4 million</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man -- 2.7 million</li></ul><p>While Sony is obviously enjoying success with its PC releases, the report said there are signs that show interest in PlayStation games on PC may be slowing down.</p><p>"All of Sony's major franchises have already landed on PC. The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served. Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this," the report said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722" data-ratio="0.57978723404255" data-width="1128" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722"></a><figcaption>Helldivers 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg"></figure><p>Looking ahead, Alinea said the challenge PlayStation faces is landing on the right window for PC releases that "protects PS5 software sales while still satisfying a PC audience that increasingly expects timely releases."</p><p>Sony does not have any strict schedules for when a PlayStation game may come to PC, except for the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">commitment to launch live-service games simultaneously for console and PC. </a>The company's marquee first-party PS5 games will not come to PC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">at least a year</a> after they originally debut on console.</p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said Sony doesn't release those games day-and-date across console and PC as part of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">protect the PlayStation console ecosystem</a>. "Our single-player, narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history--we take a more strategic approach," he said.</p><p>The Alinea report also raised the question of if Sony might look to shift its strategy in response to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> launch in 2026. The console-like six-inch cube PC could shake things up.</p><p>"If Steam begins to function as a competing ecosystem with its own dedicated hardware that plays PlayStation titles, the relationship changes," Alinea's Rhys Elliott said. "PlayStation may soon face pressure to rethink its timing and release strategy as Steam evolves from a distribution platform into a rival platform with broader reach and fewer constraints."</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing PC releases for a long time already, and the company has indicated that its next Xbox platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-says-hardware-is-core-to-the-xbox-ecosystem/1100-6536289/" data-ref-id="1100-6536289">could embrace more PC sensibilities</a>. The other big platform-holder, Nintendo, does not release any games on PC.</p><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar owner Take-Two, recently made headlines when he said the gaming industry is "moving towards PC."</p><p>"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen--that's never going away."</p>
