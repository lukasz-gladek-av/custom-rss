So far, the puzzle title only supports English as players use emoji to finish phrases with short clues. For example, there is a mystery two-word phrase with "departure" as the clue (which can be expanded, though it costs a move). The solution requires dragging over the sunrise and clock emoji for "early," followed by car and keys emoji for "start." These emoji also have to be selected from a larger group, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492" data-ratio="1.02394106814" data-width="1086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4534492"></a><figcaption>The Emoji Game is now available as part of an Apple News+ subscription, joining other puzzle titles like Crossword Mini and Quartiles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4534492-screenshot2025-07-18at11.38.00%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Emoji Game is the perfect addition to the Apple News+ suite of word and number puzzles, turning the emoji we use every day into a brainteaser that's approachable and fun," said Apple News editor-in-chief Lauren Kern.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Apple <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-spelling-game-comes-to-apple-news-plus-with-ios-17-5-update/1100-6523464/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/">debuted Quartiles on Apple News+</a>, a spelling game where players create words by combining two- to four-letter tiles. Emoji Game follows in the footsteps of Quartiles (as well as Crossword Mini) in offering new daily puzzles to solve.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple News+ costs $13 monthly and also is bundled with Apple One Premier, which costs $38 per month. The latter includes family sharing and five other subscriptions, like Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-to-launch-new-all-in-one-games-app-for-iphone-ipad-mac/1100-6532299/">Apple will launch a new all-in-one games app later this year</a> called Apple Games.

                <p>Valve's ubiquitous PC gaming storefront, Steam, may soon experience a purging of its adult content after a significant change to its guidelines this week.</p><p>In a quiet <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">update to its terms</a>, Valve has now provided that, "Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult-only content" should not be published on Steam.</p><p>The move, which invites banks and similar institutions to exercise an unprecedented degree of power in the kind of content that goes up on Steam, seems to have been made to appease the payment processors that work with Valve. This tactic, while relatively new to games, has been used in the past to go after porn and sex work sites like OnlyFans.</p><p>This change to Steam's guidelines has already brought down several games from the store. In a response to <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/07/valve-gets-pressured-by-payment-processors-with-a-new-rule-for-game-devs-and-various-adult-games-removed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>, Valve claimed that it was already notified of certain games violating the new standards set in place by its payment processors, saying, "As a result, we are retiring those games from being sold on the Steam Store, because loss of payment methods would prevent customers from being able to purchase other titles and game content on Steam. We are directly notifying developers of these games, and issuing app credits should they have another game they’d like to distribute on Steam in the future."</p><p>This shift in policy comes as multiple digital storefronts, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">Nintendo eShop</a> and Steam, begin <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rolls-out-new-eshop-publishing-guidelines-for-switch-2-in-asia-seemingly-to-curb-spam-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking down</a> on a glut of content that's been dubbed "slop" of late. Many of these titles, which seem to blatantly infringe on the aesthetics and naming conventions of existing popular games and feature sexual (see: adult) content, have popped up in great number over the last several months. Many believe these games are largely made by developers capitalizing on generative AI and large-language models to quickly produce content masquerading as the games they're ripping off.</p><p>However, the language used in the update leaves many factors unclear and open to a potentially disastrous amount of interpretation. For example, it is never clarified what "kinds of adult-only content" will not be permissible on Steam now. Moreover, the updated guidelines stress that these payment processors are enforcing new rules that should be adhered, but never makes clear exactly what the new standards of these companies are.</p><p>Despite the fact that a lot of these "slop" games lead with sexual content, there are also plenty of developers making adult-only games that touch on similar subjects. Following these changes, there are now many developers at risk of being penalized or being removed from one of the largest digital gaming storefronts.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has made a major change to what you can buy on your Xbox or through the Windows web store.

US members can sign up for <a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movies Anywhere</a> to continue watching "select" purchased content elsewhere. </p><p>If this news is upsetting and you want a refund, that's not possible, as Microsoft said its terms specify that movies and TV shows are not eligible for refunds.</p><p>Microsoft did not say why this is happening, but its FAQ about the shutdown mentions that Xbox and Microsoft Store users can buy and rent movie and TV programming through a variety of other sources, including Prime Video, Fandango at Home, Apple TV, and others.</p><p>The Movies &amp; TV app debuted in 2012 when it was known as Xbox Video. The Movies &amp; TV app for Xbox 360 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-xbox-360-store-is-closing-but-dont-get-too-worried/1100-6516956/" data-ref-id="1100-6516956">closed at the end of July 2024.</a></p><p>In other Xbox news, Microsoft recently made headlines for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">latest round of mass layoffs that led to game cancellations and at least one studio closure.</a> At the same time, Microsoft is pressing ahead with a new console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">recently announcing a partnership with AMD for this.</a></p>

It was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/">79% of Switch 2 buyers also picked up the racing game</a>. That estimated attachment rate was undoubtedly boosted by Nintendo offering a Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World.

                <p>Peter Connelly, the video game composer and sound designer on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered-starring-lara-croft/user-reviews/2200-12865716/" data-ref-id="2200-12865716">Tomb Raider Remaster series</a> and Tomb Raider: Chronicles, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for fraudulently applying for a government COVID-19 support loan. Based in Peterlee, County Durham, Connelly obtained a second Bounce Back Loan (BBL) of £37,500 (approximately $55,000) in June 2020 by greatly overstating his company's turnover. This was in direct violation of the loan rules, which only permitted one loan per business. He had already secured a legitimate loan of £22,000 the previous month.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Insovlency Service</a>, Connelly claimed his company had a 2019 turnover of £150,000 when, in reality, it had earned just over £58,000. Additionally, he falsely claimed that he had not previously applied for a BBL. His actions led to a criminal investigation by the Insolvency Service, the body responsible for monitoring misuse of the COVID loans.</p><p>At a hearing this week, Connelly was sentenced not only to prison but also disqualified from serving as a company director for six years. The Insolvency Service emphasized the seriousness of his fraud, noting that this sort of loan was created to support struggling small businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, not to be exploited for personal gain. Chief Investigator David Snasdell condemned Connelly’s "blatant disregard" for the rules.</p><p>In his defense, Connelly stated that he had undertaken financial risks to work on a high-profile project involving the reimagining of the Tomb Raider soundtrack. He claimed to have sold his car and taken out personal loans in anticipation of the project's success, which he also claimed was sidelined by the pandemic. However, the court ruled that his financial mismanagement did not excuse committing fraud.</p><p>His company, Peter Connelly Limited, entered liquidation in August 2021, with neither of the two loans repaid. In June 2022, Connelly entered into an Individual Voluntary Arrangement (IVA), agreeing to repay his debts through regular payments to an insolvency agency.</p>
