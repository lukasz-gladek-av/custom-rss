                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/">Marvel Rivals</a> has released its mid-season update for Season 1.5, and while it's a small update, it still packs a fiery punch, focusing on tweaks to The Human Torch, Iron Man, and Cloak &amp; Dagger.</p><p dir="ltr">"Following the balance adjustments in Season 1.5 and the addition of the Human Torch and The Thing, we've noticed a surge in the popularity of various heroes, leading to exciting new strategies in matches," the game's developers wrote in <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">a recent blog post announcing the update</a>. "Whether it's a rush comp centered around mobile Vanguards and Duelists, a double-flyer setup featuring Storm and Human Torch, or the classic 3-1-2 lineup with three Vanguards, or even the previously popular 2-2-2 or single Vanguard compositions, each has showcased their unique flair in the current competitive environment."</p><p dir="ltr">"So, in this mid-season balance update for Season 1.5, we'll be optimizing the experience for just a handful of heroes to maintain this rich diversity," the post went on to explain. "As we gear up for Season 2, expect new Heroes and fresh Team-Up Abilities to bring an even more thrilling experience!"</p><p dir="ltr">So which heroes are getting tweaked this time around? First up is The Human Torch, who is getting buffs to his primary attack and his ultimate ability. His Fire Cluster projectiles now move 150 meters per second (up from 120), and 14 projectiles are fired (up from the previous 12). The energy cost of his Supernova ultimate ability has been upped from 3,400 to 4,000, but its activation wave damage has increased from 70 to 80, and his Flame Tornado now does 120 damage per second (up from 100).</p><p dir="ltr">Next up is Iron Man, who is getting some slight nerfs for balance. Direct hits from his Repulsor Blast (Stage 1 and Stage 2) now do 40 damage (down from 55), but his spell field damage has increased from 35 to 50. Direct hits from a Stage 3 Repulsor Blast now do 50 damage (down from 65), and spell field damage has been increased from 40 to 60.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, Cloak &amp; Dagger are getting some attention in this update: The Duality Duo's Lightfore Dagger now heals 16 damage (up from 10) when hitting allies, but the spell field healing amount generated by the hit has decreased from 18 to 16.</p><p>For a closer look at the mid-season update, check out <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250311/41667_1217797.html" rel="nofollow ">the latest Marvel Rivals blog post</a>.</p>
