                <p>Each year The Game Awards sees its fair share of viral moments both cringe and heartwarming, but none have persisted through the years quite so much as orchestra member Pedro Eustache--better known as "Flute Guy." Fittingly, Flute Guy once again got his moment in the spotlight this year, showing off his strangest flute variant yet.</p><p>Ever since he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26w76OmzEKI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went viral in 2022</a> for enthusiastically playing the Xenoblade Chronicles 3 medley on a strange-looking tenor flute, Eustache has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528392/" data-ref-id="1100-6528392">been a regular feature of The Game Awards</a>. Each year he seems to get more dedicated airtime during the orchestral section, playing bigger and more unusual flutes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613" data-ratio="0.56235294117647" data-width="1700" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4621613"></a><figcaption>Pedro Eustache playing a strange new flute during the Clair Obscur tribute</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1597/15975876/4621613-screenshot%28917%29.jpg"></figure><p>2025, of course, is no different, with Eustache even getting his own announcement video on The Game Awards' <a href="https://x.com/thegameawards/status/1997327335725596961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media pages</a> in the lead up to the show. His appearance in the orchestral section didn't disappoint, with his flute part highlighted through the Death Stranding 2 arrangement, and his part in the Clair Obscur section played on a strange new flute that appears to be made out of PVC pipe.</p><p>Flute Guy, and the whole orchestral mix, added some needed drama to one of the most obvious Game of the Year announcements The Game Awards has seen. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 became the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">most award-winning game</a> in the awards show's history when it picked up nine awards, including Game of the Year. It had previously secured the record for most nominated game, receiving 13 total nominations. Clair Obscur has also been revealed as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">GameSpot's Game of the Year for 2025</a>.</p><p>For all the rest of the winners, losers, and surprises from The Game Awards 2025, check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">all the biggest announcements</a> from the show, as well as our roundup of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/" data-ref-id="2900-7258">all the 2025 winners</a>.</p>
