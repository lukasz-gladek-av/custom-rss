                <p>It's understandable if Xbox users feel a little skittish about the future of the console, given the recent price increases for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Xbox consoles in the US</a>, as well as formerly exclusive titles heading to PlayStation 5. Over the holiday weekend, there were so many anecdotal rumors about Target, Walmart, and other US retailers pulling Xbox consoles and games that Microsoft decided it was necessary to debunk these reports.</p><p>"Target and Walmart, among other retailers, remain committed partners for Xbox consoles, accessories, and games," a Microsoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-target-and-walmart-are-not-removing-xbox-products-from-their-stores-as-xbox-misinformation-reaches-new-levels" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>. The outlet went on to suggest that the rumors may have been born out of Costco's apparent decision to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/costco-drops-xbox-us-and-uk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remove everything Xbox-related</a> from its digital storefront ahead of the price hikes.</p><p>Microsoft has previously fielded rumors that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/" data-ref-id="1100-6532825">Xbox is abandoning hardware</a>, as exemplified by Asus handling the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally handheld devices</a>. However, Xbox VP Jason Ronald told the press that the company remains committed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">to its next generation hardware</a>.</p><p>The increasing cost of the Xbox consoles comes just as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raised prices on Game Pass</a>. Former Microsoft employee and a founding member of the original Xbox team, Laura Fryer, went on to call those increases <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-co-founder-calls-game-pass-price-hike-a-betrayal/1100-6535337/" data-ref-id="1100-6535337">a "betrayal" of the trust</a> that gamers placed in the company. Microsoft subsequently announced that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-prices-not-going-up-for-everyone-just-yet/1100-6535288/" data-ref-id="1100-6535288">price hikes won't immediately go into effect</a> for all players. But the more expensive version of Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimates-price-hike-was-quietly-paired-with-another-downside/1100-6535197/" data-ref-id="1100-6535197">losing a fan-favorite Call of Duty perk</a>.</p><p>Some analysts also believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">an ad-supported Game Pass service</a> will be added in the future. But for now, that remains speculation.</p>
