                <p>It remains to be seen what price Rockstar Games will charge for the eagerly awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but some are speculating that it could be $80, $90, or even $100. Nothing is confirmed right now, but GTA 5 actor Jay Klaitz--who played Lester--has now said he believes GTA 6 warrants a $100 price tag due to the content it's expected to offer.</p><p>"These games take so long to make. Years and years and years. It's not like they’ve just been hanging out, chilling and then just started doing the work last year. They finished GTA V and then started on GTA VI more or less immediately thereafter," <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/jay-klaitz-exclusive-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">he told The Escapist</a>. "This sh** takes forever and as we saw with GTA V the game will come out and there will be other versions, there will be downloadable content, it will be online. You're almost buying multiple games when you buy the one."</p>

<p>Klaitz said there is also a case to be made for making GTA 6 priced at a level where it can be "more accessible," but if it is $100, that would make sense to him.</p><p>"I would also like to see it made more accessible to more fans so I get that side of the argument too to make it affordable for folks. That's cool too. Maybe there's like a way to split the difference, but I share the sentiment that this game warrants that price tag. Yeah, I get that," he said.</p><p>Sales data for video games shows that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-are-ready-and-willing-to-pay-80-or-more-for-games-analyst-says/1100-6531571/" data-ref-id="1100-6531571">people are ready and willing to pay $80 or more for new games</a>, but it's still anyone's guess as to the price for GTA 6. Other experts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">$70 is the right price. </a>At least one developer maintains that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">GTA 6 "deserves" to be $100</a> due to the size and scope of the project. Some have said the game does not need to be $100 because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">the game's expected online mode could be the real money-maker</a>.</p><p>The discussion around a possible $100 price for GTA 6 stems back to researcher Matthew Ball, who said in a memo in January 2025 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">"there is hope"</a> from people in gaming that GTA 6 could be priced between $80 and $100. He pointed out that, adjusted for inflation, GTA 4 was priced at $90 and GTA 5 was $83. Things like movie tickets, rent, subscription services like Spotify and Netflix, gas, groceries, and numerous other items have gone up in price while video games have remained at "record lows," Ball said. His own personal prediction is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">GTA 6 will be priced at $70.</a></p><p>Also in the interview, Klaitz said he would like to see a future GTA game take place outside America and possibly go somewhere like Dubai. "You could be in like a big city with huge skyscrapers but then you’re out in the desert one minute later. GTA: Dubai would give you a lot of fun environments and scenarios to play with and build a game on," he said, adding that other options could be the North Pole or Greenland.</p><p>Klaitz also talked about the possibility of a GTA TV series, saying it would be "really cool to try to pull off," adding that he would personally like to see it be a live-action show as opposed to animation.</p><p>"It would be tough to translate because it's that sandbox-type game and people can do whatever they want, wherever they want, whenever they want. It's hard to sort of refocus that into a straight narrative. But it would be fun to try," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 launches in May 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

Earlier reports and leaks have hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-teases-theme-park-integration-with-disney-x-fortnite-project/1100-6530010/" data-ref-id="1100-6530010">Disney’s $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games</a> is funding a large-scale online world where progress from park attractions could influence gameplay in Fortnite. For example, guests who complete the new Smugglers Run mission might earn in-game rewards or status in the Disney x Fortnite experience--but this has not yet been officially detailed.</p><p>Still, Disney executives have stated that the company's future lies in connecting movies, games, and attractions into one shared digital ecosystem. The upcoming Smugglers Run update may be the first clear step in that direction, combining storytelling, gaming technology, and theme park interactivity in ways that blur the line between real and virtual worlds.</p>

This year, the theme is "it happens on PS5," and Sony has rolled out three ads showcasing scenes familiar to gamers.</p><p>First off, there's the stunt jump showcasing an ambitious--but failed--attempt to do a Superman and make an 18-wheeler leap over a tall building:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=woGbrJqimvE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/woGbrJqimvE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"The Unexpected Catch" shows off some fishy body horror that wouldn't look out of place in a David Cronenberg movie:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyYzIT7kNUY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uyYzIT7kNUY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>And finally, "Everyday Problems in Everyday Vehicles" proves that even in a future where interstellar ships are the norm, you just can't beat a good truck when it comes to reliability:</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTi78EVDDJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VTi78EVDDJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox has launched its own holiday marketing campaign by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-leans-into-ex-boxer-meme-for-new-advert/1100-6535874/" data-ref-id="1100-6535874">leaning into the ex-boxer meme</a>.</p><p>This month marks the fifth anniversary of the PS5, as it first went on sale on November 12, 2020. In the years since it launched, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-reach-80-million-worldwide-in-latest-milestone/1100-6533755/">the PS5 has reached 80.3 million unit sales</a> as of August 7, 2025, making it race neck-and-neck with its predecessor, the PS4, at the same time during its life-cycle. One area where the PS5 has been a big sales hit is the PlayStation Network, as Sony has grown its user base substantially here.</p><p>While November marks a major milestone for the PS5, attention is starting to shift toward the future of the console brand. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/">Amidst talk of a modular design</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">rumored PS6</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">reliance on traditional game delivery systems</a>, Sony also recently teased some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">innovative tech that will power its future gaming hardware</a>, which it's developing in partnership with AMD.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The Battle Bus dropped off Peely, Jonesy, Meowscles, and a couple of other Fortnite characters on to The Simpsons for the long-running show's opening couch gag. The crossover starts harmless enough. But then, things go awry for the Fortnite clan--especially the cute-looking banana.</p><p dir="ltr">Peely slips trying to run away from the Simpsons, who pull out weapons to get the Fortnite characters to leave their couch. That misstep leads to a terrible fate for poor Peely. The Simpsons turn the character into a banana split, bringing a horrifying new meaning to Fortnite skin. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1985104142231130272" rel="nofollow ">The official Simpsons account on X</a> shared a clip of the opening sequence from last night, November 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The crossover is a reciprocation of<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/#1"> Fortnite's recently launched Simpsons season</a>. This is a huge collaboration that has replaced the game's normal island with a Springfield-inspired map that's cel-shadded and features locations like Moe's Tavern as well as the Qwik-E-Mart. There's even a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/">Simpsons-specific Battle Pass</a>. Players can earn skins based on Homer, Marge, and even Flounders.</p><p dir="ltr">The start of The Simpsons season in Fortnite has seen a spike in player counts, as spotlighted by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1985104142231130272" rel="nofollow ">Shiina on X</a>. The battle-royale game almost hit 2.7 million concurrent players, per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count" rel="nofollow ">Fortnite.gg</a>. To put that number in perspective, that would put Fortnite at No. 2 all time <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/">for Steam concurrents</a>--though the big caveat here is Fortnite is available across PC, consoles, and mobile devices. The player count also comes nowhere close to Fortnite's all-time recorded high, which was over 14 million concurrent players roughly a year ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Fortnite dataminers believe they've found evidence pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">future collaborations with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>
