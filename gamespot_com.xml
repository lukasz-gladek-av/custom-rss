                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-and-time/1100-6534447/">Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally out</a>, and with the entire internet talking about Team Cherry's long-in-development metroidvania, you might be feeling some FOMO about it. The good news is that the game is relatively cheap to purchase, and if you're looking to save a few extra bucks, you can score a discount on the Steam version <em>and </em>some free games if you happen to be a Humble Choice subscriber. Right now, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhollow-knight-silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get the game at a 15% discount</a>, dropping the price of Silksong from $20 to $17. Humble has temporarily sold out of keys at the moment, but a restock is on the way.</p><p>This deal is one of the perks that Humble Choice subscribers get with their monthly membership, which costs $15 a month. Alongside new PC games that are refreshed every month, you also get access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games. The best thing about the membership is that the PC games you claim are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-wwe-2k25-and-seven-more-games-for-just-15-at-humble-this-month/1100-6534418/">This month is also pretty good</a>, as you can pick up WWE 2K25, Destiny 2: Legacy Collection, The Plucky Squire, Return to Monkey Island, and more.</p><p>If you bought Silksong and didn't get your Steam key before it sold out, Humble is offering DRM-free keys as an alternative. Speaking of DRM-free keys, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhollow_knight_silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get Silksong at its regular price of $20 through GOG</a>. The benefit here is that you're getting a DRM-free version of the game, which means the license for it will never be revoked and it can play without needing to start through a launcher. You can also easily load it onto a mobile gaming PC like an Asus ROG Ally and keep on playing, even when you're in an internet dead zone.</p><p>While Silksong is out, you might have to wait a little longer to play it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/">as various digital storefronts are experiencing a few issues</a>. Steam, the Nintendo eShop, the PlayStation Network, and Xbox appear to be buckling under the strain of excited players, and on Steam alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-big-launch/1100-6534482/">the game reached more than 100,000 concurrent players</a> in under an hour. If the Nintendo eShop is still down for you, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Silksong-Standard-Nintendo/dp/B0FPJHY6T3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon is selling digital Silksong keys for Switch</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally available, and it's putting up huge numbers on Steam. The game blasted off today with 5,000 concurrent players in the first five minutes, growing to 50,000 within 30 minutes and 100,000 after the first 45 minutes of availability. It's now exceeded 156,000 concurrent players.</p><p>Silksong is currently the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 5 most-played game on Steam right now.</a> The game is putting up these massive figures despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">numerous and serious issues on Steam</a> that are preventing people from accessing the store, let alone buying and playing the game.</p><p>The 2017 original Hollow Knight, meanwhile, capped out at a peak concurrent-player record of 72,916--a record that was, in fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">achieved just recently on September 3</a>. The game's player numbers no doubt spiked due to interest in the sequel.</p><p>Silksong's Steam numbers are expected to keep climbing. Historical data shows that Steam games tend to spike on weekends in terms of popularity when people generally have more free time.</p><p>Silksong is also available for console, but the same kind of player data is not available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or Switch 2. On Xbox and PC, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">game is also available via Game Pass</a>, so any sales data for those platforms wouldn't necessarily tell the whole story. For what it's worth, Silksong's rollout on console platforms also ran into a number of issues.</p><p>The original Hollow Knight sold more than 15 million copies.</p><p>In other Silksong news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-twitch-drops-how-to-get-the-hornet-badge/1100-6534483/" data-ref-id="1100-6534483">has Twitch Drops available</a> for a Hornet badge. Hornet is the playable character in Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel.</p><p>Silksong took years to come out, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/" data-ref-id="1100-6534218">wasn't because the game was stuck in development hell or anything like that</a>, the developers said. Simply put, the enormous success of the first game gave the small team the time to develop the sequel at their own pace. Also adding to the lengthy development schedule was how Silksong actually began as an expansion to Hollow Knight before shifting to a standalone release.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Ahead of its launch in October, Square Enix has revealed more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D</a> Remake, focusing on how combat has been enhanced and new items that players can take advantage of. Just like the original JRPGs, players will once again encounter monsters as they explore an overworld and several dungeons, with combat revolving around turn-based battles.</p><p>All the staples of the classic Dragon Quest gameplay are here--like spells and skills--but if you're having a tough time, the game will suggest the optimal actions you can take to exploit the weaknesses of monsters. This is an optional setting found in the game menu, and once enabled, it will show text above the enemy that indicates which of your moves will be effective against it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxEsHUslhTQ" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rxEsHUslhTQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another new feature being introduced are Scrolls, which will allow characters to learn additional spells and skills. These can be obtained from treasure chests throughout the games, but they can only be used on specific characters. The five sigils--Sun, Star, Moon, Water, and Soul--that originally appeared in Dragon Quest 2 return in Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake, and these will activate various effects in battle once they have been collected.</p><p>In Dragon Quest 1 HD, sigils can be acquired through a quest to assist the fairies, and in Dragon Quest 2 HD, sigils are collected as part of a mission to defeat Hargon, the evil high priest who leads an army of monsters. Each sigil offers unique bonuses, like guaranteed critical hit damage for special abilities and other abilities will be upgraded if certain conditions are met.</p><p>Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and Switch. if you're planning to play the game on Nintendo hardware, it's worth noting that there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-dragon-quest-remakes-wont-upgrade-from-switch-to-switch-2/1100-6533168/">no upgrade path between the different Switch console releases</a>.</p><p>"The games are a stunning marriage of classic pixel art and modern touches. I hadn't realized how much better Square Enix's 'HD-2D' aesthetic had become in recent years," Steve Watts wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-quest-12-hd-2d-remake-gives-the-classics-a-deserved-glow-up/1100-6531817/">Dragon Quest 1+2 HD-2D Remake preview</a>. "The color palette and saturation feels reminiscent of 8-bit classics, which makes the beautiful sprite artwork pop."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

The last Twitch badge to be made available in direct conjunction with a game's release was Elden Ring Nightreign's Wylder, which was unlocked by clipping moments from streamers playing the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>This time around, you can earn the Hollow Knight: Silksong Hornet badge, which depicts the sequel's protagonist, by subscribing to<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/hollow-knight-silksong?filter=drops" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> a participating channel</a>. The campaign is live now and will run until September 13. After that time, it won't be possible to earn the badge via any other method, so if you're a fan of the series and want a fun way to show it on Twitch, you've only got a short while.</p><p>Silksong's release proved so popular that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">crashed several storefronts</a> hosting the game, including Xbox where the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-september-headlined-by-hollow-knight-silksong-and-i-am-your-beast/2900-6974/" data-ref-id="2900-6974">Day One release for Game Pass</a> is hosted. Despite the release time being widely publicized, it seems nobody was expecting just how sought-after the game would be. Part of that is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksongs-price-is-cheaper-than-you-might-have-guessed/1100-6534401/" data-ref-id="1100-6534401">Silksong's modest price point</a>.</p>
