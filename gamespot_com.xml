                <p>Greek teenager Angelos Mako was a young man on a mission. Almost 10 years since Facebook removed Dungeon Rampage, Mako wanted to bring back the game that was a safe space for him during a rough time in his life. After years of trying to recreate the code, Mako now owns the code and the license, and it'll soon be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"My parents were going through a very nasty divorce. Dungeon Rampage was there for me. Every time they would fight, I would go into another room and I would play," Mako told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dungeon-rampage-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "It took care of me when no one else could."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dungeon Rampage Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Playing the game every day for five years straight, it became part of his young life, then suddenly the game was removed. That set off his quest to get it back, even at the age of 10.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870" data-ratio="0.5671875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870"></a><figcaption>Dungeon Rampage is back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png"></figure><p>"I couldn't fathom it. I couldn't understand why it happened," he continued. "But even from that moment, I said that I'm going to find a way to get this back again. I had no clue how, but I had a dream."</p><p>He eventually did some apprenticeships for a Roblox team, working in Unity. While he was doing that, four years later, he ran across a Discord server that was trying to remake Dungeon Rampage and joined in. He quickly learned they wanted to remake the game instead of restoring the original, but Mako took over that project last year, trying to do more of the latter.</p><p>"I was fed up. I wanted this to come to life," Mako said. "Okay, I'm starting from scratch. I'm taking initiative. And I went directly to try and get the copyright of Dungeon Rampage." Using a saved credits screen from the game, he made a LinkedIn account and messaged everyone he could find. "People replied, actually. That's the weird part."</p><p>One of the first people to reach out was Jason Yeung, the game's original creative director. Yeung agreed that the attempt to remake Dungeon Rampage was a cool project, but he needed to speak with Mike Goslin, former head of Rebel Entertainment, the original Dungeon Rampage developer. Mako soon spoke to Goslin on the phone, who then introduced him to the CEO of the parent company, and he got his license agreement.</p><p>Only one problem: Nobody seemed to have the original code.</p><p>Mako tracked down the last engineer on the project, who said he might have the files of the last build on a laptop--something he gave his young daughter to play with. Luckily, the laptop and the files were still intact. It turned out to be a tougher challenge than they expected because Dungeon Rampage wasn't a simple Flash game; it was Flash and C++ and a PHP backend. When one part was working fine, others seemed to fall apart, but after several trials and errors, the game finally booted up, with Mako being the first one to play it in eight years.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter campaign</a> was set up and easily crushed its initial $25,000 goal--it's at $66,000 now, and on its final day. The team event got access to the original game's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dungeonrampage/">Facebook</a> page as well.</p><p>"It's a very fun game and it's been a very fun game forever," Mako added. "Those first days of playing again were the first days of discovering fire as a caveman. That's my best analogy of this."</p>

Acer's 50mm drivers provide a robust soundscape for the price, so it's a solid option for a travel headset or for casual and younger players shopping on a budget. Most impressively, the headset can run for up to 100 hours on a full charge.</p><p>It's also versatile thanks to 2.4GHz Wireless and Bluetooth support. On PlayStation consoles, you'll need to connect the wireless receiver to your console's USB port to establish a connection. PC players can sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz or Bluetooth, with the latter also providing compatibility for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, Steam Deck, mobile, and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. A wired connection is available with the included, detachable 3.5mm audio cable. The microphone for chat has built-in noise-canceling tech, but it's worth mentioning that the mic will not work with Nintendo Switch consoles.</p><p>As mentioned, the cheapest model at the moment is black with red accents on the headband and exterior earcups, but there are other accents as well as two models with a white base color. All models come with plush earcups and a cushioned, plastic headband. Keep in mind that cheap headsets tend to wear down faster than pricier models due to material quality.</p><p><strong>Acer wireless headset deals</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CLYH2DRN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Red</a> -- $34 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L637P6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L2QFF1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HLYH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8L3HHKF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQB42N1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pastel Pink</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DPQ7CRWS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">White</a> -- $40 (<strike>$50</strike>)</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>If you are in the market for a new headset in the $100 range, SteelSeries has just launched a new wireless model in its popular Arctis Nova range, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F9548L67,B0F94KTF6C&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Arctis Nova 3 Wireless</a>.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At an event like Summer Game Fest, where demos and trailers are coming from every direction, the really special experiences are the ones that stay with me long after my demo time has ended. Whether it's the game I try, or the conversation surrounding it, the games I continue to think about days or weeks afterward are the ones I most heartily recommend others explore as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For SGF 2025, that game was Ambrosia Sky, the first project from Toronto-based Soft Rains Studio. The brief demo I played seems like a "clean-'em-up" style game like Powerwash Simulator, but the underlying story surrounding those cleanup missions is so interesting and introspective that it has stuck with me ever since. There is a respect and reverence paid to the dead in Ambrosia Sky that video games routinely lack, and I think that respect is going to lead to a very emotional story when the game is complete.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing Ambrosia Sky is pretty straightforward: I control a woman named Dalia, who holds the role of "Scarab"--this world's version of a "mortician." She's someone who is tasked with disposing of bodies, collecting mushroom samples around those bodies, and testing them to try and find a way to rid the universe of the invasive fungus. As Dalia, I enter a cluster colony near the rings of Saturn, as I've been assigned a recently deceased man to examine.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVVYIfCX6tg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FVVYIfCX6tg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As the demo begins, I'm armed with a pistol-like tool that shoots cleansing water and other elements to remove fungus I see in my path. Some fungi hold special properties--one strain is electrified and can damage me if I get too close, while another is highly flammable and can be destroyed over time with a well-placed flame shot from my tool.</p><p dir="ltr">One room requires me to solve a puzzle by routing electricity to a dormant power terminal in order to unlock the door next to it. I learn that I can use a sample of the electrified fungus to shoot a version of it from my tool, which I can use to create a path from a nearby light on the ceiling to the power terminal, giving it the electricity it needs for me to proceed. It's a neat trick, as it gives a small "aha!" moment and makes me wonder how other elemental blasts will come into play.</p><p dir="ltr">I reach my target and begin the process of disposing of the body and collecting the sample--and this is where Ambrosia Sky ascended from "simple cleaning game" to "thought-provoking experience." Rather than simply standing and watching while the corpse fades away and converts to the sample I need, I watch through Dalia's eyes as she starts the process, and then quietly kneels in front of the deceased, her hands on her lap.</p><p dir="ltr">She places herself in a pose of reflection, respect, and reverence for the dead, creating a moment I found beautiful and poignant. In her own way, she is paying respect to the departed, and I didn't have to press F to achieve it--it was part of the normal gameplay experience.</p><p dir="ltr">This, co-founder Joel Burgess told me after the demo ended, was completely intentional.</p><p dir="ltr">"The idea of after-death care is something we've thought about a lot; there's a combination of sterility and intimacy in it, acting at the same time," Burgess said. "Treating these bodies with respect has been very pervasive throughout, with the challenge being how we actually portray that through actions and presentation."</p><p dir="ltr">Dalia--whose name certainly sounds like it was intentional given the themes of death and dying, but Burgess would not confirm or deny--went through multiple iterations on how she acts around these dead people throughout the development process, Burgess explained. "How does Dalia touch a thing? Is she handling this object a bit too rough?" he says. "That, plus the kneeling posture shown in the demo, are all parts of us trying to convey that respect."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515861"></a><figcaption>Ambrosia Sky</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515861-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515862,1300-4515863,1300-4515864,1300-4515865,1300-4515866,1300-4515867,1300-4515868" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515862-ambrosiasky_07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515863-ambrosiasky_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515864-ambrosiasky_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515865-ambrosiasky_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515866-ambrosiasky_03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515867-ambrosiasky_01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4515868-ambrosiasky_02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's also a personal layer to this story for Dalia--one that the demo alludes to through in-game messages, but doesn't outright call out. Dalia is a former citizen of this cluster, and the person she's tasked with collecting is someone she knew before she left 15 years prior. In fact, if you search the target's terminal across the room from where the body is found, you'll find that he archived the last message he received from Dalia before she left.</p><p dir="ltr">That personal connection is at the root of Dalia's reverence for those she's tasked with performing these last rites for, and Burgess and his team not only explore that through her, but also through environmental storytelling like the terminal above. Every corpse Dalia comes across on her way to her target can be analyzed, and doing so is usually followed by Dalia paying her respects by saying something to the effect of, "I'm sorry I couldn't help you."</p><p dir="ltr">The personal elements to Dalia's story have layers of their own, too: Other in-game messages reference the fact that, in order for a corpse to be collected by a Scarab for this research, the deceased must give consent before they pass away. It's also brought to light that our target only gave his consent moments before he died; Burgess says that, if you look hard enough, you'll learn that the deceased knew Dalia became a Scarab--and that she would be assigned to his collection should he give his consent.</p><p dir="ltr">The layers upon layers of storytelling contained in a game that, on the surface, involves simply removal of fungus from a space station, is what makes Ambrosia Sky so interesting. The focus on death--and particularly the payment of respect to those who have passed--also possesses a universal appeal, which is why Burgess and his team decided to place it at the center of their story.</p><p dir="ltr">"At the end of the day, death comes for all of us; it doesn't matter what culture you're from, what your background is, your age," Burgess said. "You will die, you will know people who pass, you will go through this as well." That relatability, once Ambrosia Sky is released, has the chance to resonate with everyone who decides to give it a try.</p><p dir="ltr">Ambrosia Sky is "coming soon" on PC.</p>

Slider once crooned it to a villager in Animal Crossing, while Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin 2 both play the song if you sit on a certain menu screen for too long. Now, the melody has surfaced in Mario Kart World, which makes for the 25th confirmed instance of the melody being hidden in a Nintendo game.</p><p dir="ltr">As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-long-running-musical-easter-egg-has-been-found-in-mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>, a Reddit user by the name of "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1la5xcm/totakas_song_in_mario_kart_world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">charizardtelephone</a>" found the song in the latest Mario Kart's character-select screen. By moving the cursor to Yoshi and leaving it there, the cute little dino starts humming the familiar tune.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World – Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is not the first time the song has appeared in a Mario Kart game, nor is it the first time Yoshi is the one singing it--in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, if you move your kart close to a Yoshi watching the race, you'll hear Yoshi's voice singing the tune there as well. Fittingly, Totaka himself has provided the voice of Yoshi since Yoshi's Story in 1998.</p><p dir="ltr">Totaka's Song first appeared in X, which was released in 1990 for the Game Boy, before making an appearance in Mario Paint in 1992. Since then, it has appeared in 25 different games, including multiple titles in the Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, and Yoshi franchises. Its most recent appearance before this was 2020's Animal Crossing: New Horizons, where players could request it by asking K.K. Slider to play "K.K. Song."</p>

                <p>Pokemon Go is now owned by Scopely, which itself is owned by Saudi Arabia-owned Savvy Games. What's the day-to-day impact on Pokemon Go based on its new ownership? Not much, according to Pokemon Go's game director.</p><p>Michael Steranka told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he understands why people are skeptical. After all, there are countless examples of a new owner coming in and making major changes.</p><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka said. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that... I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless."</p><p>Niantic sold its games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion, and this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 most-expensive video game acquisition in history.</a></p><p>Steranka also clarified that the Pokemon Go development team will "pretty much never" engage directly with the bosses at Savvy. He said it's his understanding that Savvy allows Scopely to "operate the way they want to operate."</p><p>The director went on to say he's excited by the fact that Scopely is 100% a video game company, whereas Niantic had projects in the works across multiple content categories. "That's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he said. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><p>In terms of what fans can expect from Pokemon Go in the future under its new ownership, Steranka said the team plans to pull back from AR initiatives for the game. He said it's no secret that players "have not been super excited about some of the AR systems" in the game. In the future, Steranka said fans can only expect new AR features if it's something the team believes in fully and could be something "exciting."</p><p>"Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap," he said. "We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p>Scopely is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">working with The Witcher studio CD Projekt on a new game.</a></p>

A cinematic cut of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to debut at a film festival next month.</p><p>The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut will get its premiere screening on July 9 during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic. The announcement (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut-kviff-premiere-1236291931/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) doesn't say how long the cinematic cut will be, but it will follow the narrative of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who sets out to avenge his family and protect Sir Hans Capon during a diplomatic mission gone wrong.</p><p>Daniel Vávra and Petr Pekař are both credited as the director of the cinematic cut. Vávra wrote and directed both Kingdom Come games, while Pekar is Warhorse's cinematic director and led the team of animators who created five hours of cutscenes for the sequel. It's unclear if Warhorse Studios intends to screen the cinematic cut outside of the film festival, but CEO Martin Frývadlský expressed his eagerness to see the game's story get its due.</p><p>"I have wished to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on the big screen for a long time," said Frývadlský in a statement. "I believe that the civil story of a blacksmith’s son will also appeal to film audiences and stand up to the competition of international movie productions. Together with my colleagues in the studio, we are proud that we have the opportunity to present the story we have been working on for many years in a world premiere at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival."</p><p>PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers recently received the opportunity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-trial-experience-on-ps-plus-premium/1100-6531873/" data-ref-id="1100-6531873">play through the first few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> as a trial experience. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski also praised the game and noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-talks-kingdom-come-and-baldurs-gates-influence-on-the-witcher-4/1100-6532120/" data-ref-id="1100-6532120">that it influenced The Witcher 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is getting a <em>third</em> official Lego mode on Wednesday, in the form of Lego Fortnite <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Expeditions</a>, a four-player co-op mode that allows players to team up on a variety of action-adventure missions. For those Lego fans who have asked for a Lego Fortnite mode that recalls the many different story-based Lego adventure games, like Lego Star Wars, Expeditions is the one you've been waiting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOPVQSHIic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lego Fortnite Expeditions is the first official Lego mode in Epic's metaverse that doesn't involve building stuff--the purpose of this game is to battle enemies and solve puzzles alongside your friends. But don't worry--you won't be stuck using only the same sorts of weapons and items you can find in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, because Expeditions has character classes with unique abilities that you can upgrade as you complete missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the three classes–Hunter, Shadow Caller, and Rift Ripper--has its own unique main power and movement ability. The Rift Ripper, for example, can use rifts to get high ground or travel, or to drop crystal on the heads of baddies, while the Hunter can mark and make enemies more vulnerable to damage with its Bulls-eye Blade. If you wanna get weird, try out the Shadow Caller class, which can turn into a flock of ravens in an instant to escape any bad situation.</p><p dir="ltr">When Expeditions launches on Wednesday, it'll be accessible both as its own mode in the Discover page in the lobby, and by visiting a battle bus location in Lego Fortnite Odyssey or Lego Fortnite Brick Life. Odyssey, Lego's sandbox crafting mode, will also experience some bleedthrough from Expeditions, as new baddies introduced in the mode will start invading Odyssey islands in July sometime.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Expeditions is just one of several parts of the massive June 18 update, which almost feels big enough to be a new season update by this point. In addition to Expeditions, this update will begin a new season of Fortnite Festival with a brand-new headlining artist, launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-yet-another-new-battle-royale-mode/1100-6532468/" data-ref-id="1100-6532468">the new Blitz Royale mode</a>, and see Ballistic expand with another new map.</p>
