                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a> is on the way, and tonight during WWE Raw on Netflix, the official cover star was revealed. If you've followed the teases, you may have already figured it out, but now it's official: Roman Reigns will be featured on the cover of WWE 2K25.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns had one of the biggest years of his career in 2024. After 1,316 days as WWE Champion, he finally dropped the title to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40. For months, he was off-screen, as his cousin Solo Sikoa had disowned him post-defeat from their familial faction, The Bloodline, and claimed the role of leader for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns returned at SummerSlam to reclaim his spot as the "Tribal Chief" to a chorus of massive cheers from the crowd. Turning face but still keeping a harder edge to his character than Rhodes' purer Face That Runs The Place role, Reigns has re-emerged as the fan-favorite good guy the company once spent years failing to create.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, the cover star news is all we have to go on regarding WWE 2K25, but stick around, as we expect to share more soon on this year's wrestling sim. If the WWE 2K24 schedule is any sort of indication, we can expect to see this year's game launch a few weeks ahead of WrestleMania, which would slot it into a March launch some time.</p><p dir="ltr">In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/">WWE 2K24 review</a>, I wrote, "As both WWE and the wider format of pro wrestling live through a new golden age, it's fortuitous timing for fans that this year's game is so great. While the MTX-heavy mode feels tacked on like a publisher mandate, there are thankfully several other modes that each feel like they deserve to be played for many months ahead, making them the true centerpieces of your personal WWE universe."</p>
