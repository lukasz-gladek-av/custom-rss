                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off the game's next-level visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. According the game's director, Aoba Miyazaki, one of the highlights of My Hero Academia: All's Justice is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A. From this roster, players will assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing them to chain together attacks and quirk abilities. A new Rising system will also players to "significantly boost" the power of their characters by unleashing "their full potential," though the studio did not specify exactly what that might entail.</p><p>However, Bandai Namco did confirm it will be sharing more about My Hero Academia: All's Justice in the near future. For the time being, players can wishlist the upcoming title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p><p>The announcement of My Hero Academia: All's Justice comes more than five years after the last My Hero Fighting Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">One's Justice 2</a>, was released back in March 2020. One's Justice 2 was considered a significant step up from its predecessor, One's Justice, but failed to garner the sort of praise reserved for Bandai Namco's Naruto fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm/" data-ref-id="5000-33192">Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>, or its Dragon Ball fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz/" data-ref-id="5000-465487">FighterZ</a>.</p>

Separately, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that "every game" on display at the event in June is "continuing on."</p><p>In terms of games that are not going forward, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild </a>and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">new Perfect Dark have been canceled</a>--neither appeared at the Showcase, fueling theories about what that could mean.

We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>Going forward, Booty claimed Xbox's portfolio strategy is "unchanged," and that is to make great games filled with "new stories, worlds, and characters." He specified that Microsoft has 40+ games in "active development" and teased a "strong slate" for 2026 that will include the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-teases-2026-plans-including-possible-halo-release/1100-6532264/" data-ref-id="1100-6532264">new Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, the next Forza game, and a possible Halo release.</a></p><p>Microsoft's cuts to Xbox came as part of a wider cost-cutting program that saw the technology giant lay off about 4% of its global workforce, amounting to around 9,000 people.</p>

Iron Man fans can still grab that model today, but it's selling for its full $40 MSRP. The bundles are discounted, however, allowing you to pick up an <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Bundle-release-Glacier-Limited/dp/B0DKPFN5PW?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot (5th Gen) and Iron Man Stand</a></strong> for $62 (was $90). That’s the same price you’d pay if you picked up the discounted Spider-Man Stand and an Echo Dot (5th Gen), making it a good choice if you don’t yet have the smart speaker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png" data-ref-id="1300-4525227" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png" data-ref-id="1300-4525227"></a><figcaption>Amazon Echo Dot with Iron Man Stand</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4525227-ironman.png"></figure><p>Speaking of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-vibrant-helpful-routines-Charcoal/dp/B09B8V1LZ3?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Dot</a>, the standalone speaker is available for $32 (was $50), though you can also find it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Amazon-Basics-Smart-Color/dp/B0DGRFBFP2?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundled with an Amazon Basics Smart Color Bulb</a> for $37 (was $63). Consider spending the extra few bucks on this option, as you’ll be able to control the bulb via voice commands with your new smart speaker. The bulb typically costs $13, so you’re saving a nice chunk of change for Prime Day. If you’re not sold on the Echo Dot, the bulb can be <a href="https://amzn.to/4kgihVN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundled with several other products</a>.</p><p>A bunch of <a href="https://amzn.to/4evC4Q1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon devices</a> are discounted for Prime Day, including the affordable <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/dp/B09ZXJDSL5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Pop</a></strong>. This smart speaker is now just $22 (was $40), and while it doesn't sound quite as robust as the Echo Dot, it's a good choice for small spaces that don't need the 360-degree soundscape provided by the Dot. This is the best price we've seen in 2025, and it's not likely to stick around past Prime Day.
