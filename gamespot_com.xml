While new main story campaign quests are expected, the patch has more than a few surprises in store, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of them is a new way to level characters that sounds like a more story-driven version of Chromie Time. By speaking to Lorewalker Cho in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, or Dornogal starting in patch 11.1.7, players can complete three repeatable quest chains containing both old and new quests from previous expansions but that share a common story thread. One quest chain, for example, dives into the history of iconic Warcraft villain Arthas, where players will be able to battle through Strathholme during the culling before jumping to the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion and stepping into the shoes of Arthas himself. Another questline dives into the history of current main villain Xal'atath, as players experience her origins in Legion, how she regained her physical form in Battle for Azeroth, and a past confrontation between her and the Old Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate much on the new Lorewalker Cho quests, but it seems a great way to keep new or returning players up to date on plot threads that are currently relevant, with Xal'atath's origins, and another quest chain involving the Ethereals, being perfect examples. Why Arthas and the Lich King are featured prominently with a questline despite having no real connection to The War Within's events is anyone's guess. Perhaps the Lich King still has some role to play, or more likely Blizzard simply knows Arthas is one of the game's most enduring characters. Presumably, max-level characters can also experience these quest chains for a lore refresher, though what rewards they might contain is currently unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">Another surprise is the introduction of Overcharged Delves, more dangerous versions of six specific Delves that will feature more traps and enemies, as well a new trait tree specific to these amped up versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">WoW's solo dungeons</a>. Blizzard will additionally be adding Battle for Azeroth dungeons to the game's Timewalking lineup as part of the return of the Turbulent Timeways event, complete with a new Battle for Azeroth Timewalking vendor.</p><p dir="ltr">While it will be coming sometime after the patch's launch, Blizzard also detailed the return of its Diablo-themed Greedy Emissary event that sees players hunting down Treasure Goblins for rare loot. This time the loot will be even more desirable, as there will be a new mount and recolors of WoW's recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">remastered tier 2 armor sets</a> that players will definitely want to collect.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 will additionally bring UI improvements in the form of the recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">revealed Combat Assistant</a>. This feature when enabled will mimic the behavior of popular rotation assistance add-ons by displaying which ability a player should use next for optimal damage, but goes a step further by including a single-button rotation option that will automatically cast abilities in sequence. It's just the latest way Blizzard is looking to bring add-on functionality into WoW's base UI, with its most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-april-22-update-will-finally-offer-an-easy-alternative-to-a-critical-ui-add-on/1100-6530701/" data-ref-id="1100-6530701">recent patch introducing a Cooldown Manager</a> meant to replace the popular WeakAuras add-on.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: The War Within patch 11.1.7 doesn't have a release date yet but is now available for testing on the game's public test realm.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's strategy of releasing first-party Xbox games on PlayStation looks to be working, as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced during its Q3 FY25 earnings call that the company was recently the top publisher on the PlayStation Store when it came to preorders.</p><p dir="ltr">The period Nadella referred to was January through March 2025, when he said Microsoft ended the quarter as the top publisher by preorders and preinstalls on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Other stats Nadella highlighted included news that PC Game Pass revenue was up 45% year-over-year, and that while Xbox hardware revenue declined 6% over the previous year, it saw gaming revenue increase 5% and Xbox content and services revenue increase by 8%. Those numbers were thanks to growth in Xbox Game Pass, Call of Duty, and Minecraft, Nadella said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what Xbox games available on PlayStation led to so many preorders, Microsoft had several big titles set to release shortly after the time period Nadella cited. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-indiana-jones-was-the-weeks-top-seller-but-it-wasnt-in-the-top-15-most-played/1100-6531178/" data-ref-id="1100-6531178">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle released April 17 and became the best-selling PS5 game</a> for that week (even if it wasn't in the top 15 most-played games). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-performance-on-ps5-pro-is-a-compromise-free-experience-experts-says/1100-6531102/" data-ref-id="1100-6531102">Forza Horizon 5 released for PS5</a> shortly after on April 29 (or on April 25 for those who bought the premium edition). Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, set for release on May 15, is likely also driving preorders for Microsoft on Sony's platform.</p><p dir="ltr">While Nadella didn't mention it during the investor call, Microsoft the following day announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">sweeping price increases for Xbox consoles</a>, accessories, and games. All Xbox Series consoles, including the Series X, saw price jumps of up to $100, while controller prices increased between $5 and $10. Microsoft additionally announced select first-party games will cost $80 starting this holiday season, but did not name specific titles.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Microsoft, the price hikes were made with "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development."</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft didn't cite recently enacted US tariffs as the specific reason for the price increases, but it wouldn't be the first video game publisher affected. Nintendo delayed Switch 2 preorders in order to assess the impact tariffs might have, announcing several weeks later it would increase the price of Switch 2 accessories (but not the console itself, at least at launch) due to "market conditions."</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in May, and this month celebrates May The 4th with some Star Wars games, brings one of Xbox'ss top shooters, and delivers an indie darling that recreates the feelings of late-'90s Internet culture.</p><p>As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" rel="nofollow ">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>With May The 4th approaching at the beginning of the month, there is plenty of Star Wars representation in the first batch of free Prime Gaming titles. Both Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga will be available on the first week of the month, and each offers a unique gateway to fun Star Wars action--Galactic Battlegrounds for the real-time-strategy fans, and Lego Star Wars for those looking for something silly and lighthearted.</p><p>Outside of Star Wars, one of the marquee games on this month's free lineup is Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. You'll be able to get ready for the Doom Slayer's next adventure by leading his canonical great-great-grandfather B.J. Blazkowicz take on the Nazis in an alternate version of America.</p><p>If you're looking for something you've never played before, Hypnospace Outlaw will certainly fit the bill: It simulates the Internet of the late 1990s, as you try to surf the web in order to solve mysteries and thwart criminals from wreaking havoc on the World Wide Web. Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell, meanwhile, features an entire musical number in the middle of the game, and that alone is worth checking the Saints Row sidestory out for yourself.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for May 2025</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Styx: Master of Shadows [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">The Invisible Hand [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 8</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Digital Deluxe Edition [Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: Rebirth [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Hypnospace Outlaw [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Doors - Paradox [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 15</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Saints Row: Gat out of Hell [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Legend Definitive Edition [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Golf with Your Friends [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Mail Time [GOG Code]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 22</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Fate [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Thief 2: The Metal Age [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Everdream Valley [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Chessarama [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">The Lost Ashford Ring [Legacy Games Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Samurai Bringer [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 29</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Trinity Fusion [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Masterplan Tycoon [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Liberté [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Jennifer Wilde Unlikely Revolutionaries [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to play the following games in May via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars III - The Clone Wars</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga</li><li dir="ltr">Disney Planes</li><li dir="ltr">Death Stranding Director's Cut</li><li dir="ltr">Lawn Mowing Simulator: Landmark Edition</li><li dir="ltr">House of Golf 2</li><li dir="ltr">RiMS Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Haven</li><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Pinball</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite OG</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Ballistic</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Festival</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li dir="ltr">Rocket Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite</li><li dir="ltr">Trackmania Starter Access</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

                <p dir="ltr">Fans of Color Gray Studio's Golden Idol point-and-click mystery franchise will soon have a new riddle to unravel. After its first expansion, The Sins Of New Wells, cast a new perspective on certain endgame events in The Rise Of The Golden Idol, Color Gray is back with Golden Idol Investigation: The Lemurian Phoenix, which will launch May 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lemurian Phoenix will add five new scenarios to Rise Of The Golden Idol, which will make it the largest expansion to date. The story will span 40 years, and it will involve a murder that "ignites a complex conspiracy that reaches back to 1910," according to the blog post on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2716400/view/519712411641446587" rel="nofollow ">Rise Of The Golden Idol Steam page</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485986-lemurian-idol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485986" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485986-lemurian-idol.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485986"></a><figcaption>Golden Idol Investigations: The Lemurian Phoenix</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485986-lemurian-idol.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Official Rise Of The Golden Idol social media pages have been <a href="https://x.com/ColorGray7/status/1916861742740656243" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaving clues</a> for players to solve, with the answers revealing the names of the five scenarios coming to the game via The Lemurian Phoenix. Eventually, the fanbase was able to decipher all five scenario names, and they are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Eternity's End</li><li dir="ltr">Ascension</li><li dir="ltr">Royal Blood</li><li dir="ltr">Revelation</li><li dir="ltr">A Blaze of Glory</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Rise Of The Golden Idol first launched in November 2024, where it continued the story of the titular idol and its mysterious abilities to make people older or younger in an instant. The original game, The Case Of The Golden Idol, introduced the gaming world to the idol--and the Cloudsley family who controlled it--in October 2022.</p><p dir="ltr">Golden Idol Investigations: The Lemurian Phoenix will launch May 13 on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. It will also be added to the Netflix Games version of Rise Of The Golden Idol, which is available for free on mobile devices to all Netflix subscribers.</p>

"We felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game," he said.</p><p>To sum up, Handrahan said, "Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis said 35% of Expedition 33 players overall also played Oblivion Remastered, with 55% of Expedition 33 players on Xbox also spending time with Oblivion Remastered. The crossover was more limited on Steam (22%) and PS5 (16%).</p><p>Xbox was also the most popular platform overall for Expedition 33, Ampere found, saying 45% of all players came from Xbox, with 47% of Oblivion Remastered players on Xbox. PS5 was No. 2 for Expedition 33, making up 30% of players, with Steam following as the third-biggest platform (25%).</p><p>For Oblivion Remastered, Ampere's data said Steam was No. 2 (34%) followed by PlayStation (19%). The preference for Xbox for both titles was attributable in part to both games being included with Game Pass, the report said.</p><p>While Xbox was the top platform for both Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered, it wasn't the biggest platform for either title based on playtime. Ampere said the average playtime for Expedition 33 on Xbox was 2.2 hours, compared to 4.4 hours on PlayStation and Steam. For Oblivion Remastered, PlayStation users played an average of 3.8 hours, compared to 3.6 hours on Steam, and 2.2 hours on Xbox.</p><p>All of the figures here from Ampere cover data from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe, from each game's launch through Sunday, April 27. Oblivion Remastered, of course, came out two days before Expedition 33, which no doubt had an effect on Ampere's findings.</p>

                <p>"Mechs, outer space, and giant monsters" sounds like a winning formula on the surface, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battle-suit-aces/" data-ref-id="5000-631825">Battle Suit Aces</a> puts a unique spin on it. Rather than offering full-scale, action-packed battles across the universe, Trinket Studios' next game instead boils things down to a sleek, card-based battle system, which focuses on resource management and strategy rather than brute force action--all while adding dozens of interesting characters with fully voiced dialogue on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing an hour-long demo, it's immediately clear that Trinket is on to something with this unique approach, but it's too early to tell if the experiment will stick the landing. Battle Suit Aces is trying something different, and so far, the results are worthy of your attention.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battle Suit Aces - Official Reveal Trailer | Future of Play 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aces high</h2><p dir="ltr">Battle Suite Aces follows a simple premise: A group of spacefarers called the Patchworks travel the universe in a massive spaceship called the USS Zephyr, as they explore planets looking for ancient tech. In their travels, they have found and commandeered a Gundam-adjacent mech suit, and eventually they meet other characters with mech suits of their own.</p><p dir="ltr">The crew fights against the Frenzied, mysterious monsters that can attack without notice and devastate everything in their path. The Zephyr and its crew meet the Frenzied multiple times throughout the demo, an excellent introduction to Battle Suit Aces' novel battle system.</p><p dir="ltr">Fights take place via a card-battling system, where each character you've recruited is represented by a card featuring their mech. There are also secondary cards--in the demo, for example, these are all attack drones--which can attack for you as needed. The USS Zephyr, meanwhile, is the "player" of these cards, but it has a set life total--if enemies attack enemy spaces on your side of the board, the Zephyr will take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595"></a><figcaption>Battle Suit Aces uses cards to depict space battles between mechs, ships, and drones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the board, the battlefield is a single row containing five slots, and only one card can fit in a slot at a time. As you fill slots in the row with cards, you accrue energy in whichever color is represented on the card--the deck in the demo contains blue and red energy (the full game may have more), so you'll accrue one energy of a certain color for each card in your row. After energy is accrued, you can choose how to spend it on attacks and other abilities, and you can also move cards to different slots once per turn in order to maximize the turn's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the full strategic prowess of the Battle Suit Aces fighting system comes into play. Each battle is won by reducing the HP of the main enemy to zero, and you damage that enemy the same way they can damage the Zephyr--by firing a card's weapon into a slot not occupied by an enemy card. If the opponent places a card in an empty slot, damage will be taken by that card before the main enemy will, meaning that each card is "protecting" its leader when placed.</p><p dir="ltr">Every battle in the demo offered multiple different paths to victory, creating an engaging and sometimes stressful experience. Early battles are easy, as they're normally won by moving a powerful mech to empty slots as needed. Later on, the demo throws a couple of curveballs into the battle mechanics; one battle creates more enemy cards whenever one of their own is killed, while another places shields in each slot which need to be broken before the main enemy can be damaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596"></a><figcaption>Between missions, you can customize your deck of cards.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a battle, you can visit different rooms on the USS Zephyr and make changes to your mechs, drones, and more in different rooms of the ship. This adds an air of customization to the experience, as it lets you throw your ideal curveballs at an enemy ship depending on your chosen loadout. I really like the way Trinket Studios has already shown it can tweak the battle system on the fly, and I'm excited to see what sort of mad scientist experiments later battles in the game will present.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The heart of the cards</h2><p dir="ltr">Battling in Battle Suit Aces is fun, but the real joy comes from listening to the characters interact with one another. Each character is fully voiced, and unique personalities burst from each of those voices. Heathcliff is the leader of the crew and an adept engineer in his own right. Daciana is a fiery mechanic with a seedy backstory. Jules is a researcher obsessed with analyzing every last inch of ancient tech--and he drinks a <em>lot</em> of coffee. The dozen or so characters I met in this demo all burst with personality, and their back-and-forth banter elicited more than a few laughs. There were a few references to potential plot points in the main game too.</p><p dir="ltr">These characters are the emotional heart that brings the rest of Battle Suit Aces to life, and listening to their stories unfold is very cool. However, this demo is heavily unbalanced in terms of "dialogue time" versus "gaming time." There is a hefty amount of dialogue that you have to skip through, and while it's all important and worthy of your attention, it does mean it will take a while to get from one card battle to the next.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597"></a><figcaption>Like Battle Chef Brigade, Battle Suit Aces' biggest strengths are its gorgeous art and intriguing characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do decide to listen, there's also a ton of information being thrown at you all at once, and it may leave you wondering what the heck is happening in this game. Some of the terms are easy enough to pick up--Blue Crest is the name of the ancient mech, the Pholians are the ancient race who developed the tech, etc.--but there are some sentences that sound like complete rubbish out of context. If you're the type that likes to have all of the information all at once, you may experience an overload of that info before long, especially in the time constraints of an hour-long demo.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Suit Aces smashes a bunch of different elements together--mech suits, spaceships, card battles, upgrade systems, dialogue trees, and more--into an interesting package. Card battles are fun and engaging, especially when extra wrinkles are thrown in to challenge you in new ways. The crew of the Zephyr are shaping up to be the emotional weight of the story, with a few interesting details already spilling out in this short demo playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo only offered a limited amount of time with Trinket Studios' latest, but despite the brevity, I'm hopeful that the full experience will come up aces.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo for Battle Suit Aces is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>
