                <p>Is there going to be a third The Last of Us game? Given the big success of the first two games and the HBO series, many are expecting more entries in the game series. But Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann says it would take something special for the studio to make a third game.</p><p>He told <a href="https://x.com/NaughtyNDC/status/1909971408546914368" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ComicBook</a> that he's currently focused on the TV show--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-announced-before-season-2-has-even-premiered/1100-6530734/" data-ref-id="1100-6530734">which was just renewed for a third season</a>--along with the game he's directing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. He's not ruling out a third The Last of Us game, but he's not confirming it either.</p><p>"Back at Naughty Dog, we're now working on Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which is something we've been working on for many years. That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p>Druckmann went on to say the story in the first The Last of Us was structured to have a "definitive ending" because he didn't know if he would get to make a sequel. But the game was a big success and Druckmann came back for The Last of Us: Part II. He said Naughty Dog didn't <em>have </em>to make the sequel because Naughty Dog owner Sony trusts the company enough to make its own decisions.</p><p>"But we had an idea [for The Last of Us: Part II] that we felt passionate about. It was a good enough idea to spend years on it. We worked on the story and felt like, 'OK, that story has come full circle. The definitive ending for this moment in time,'" he said.</p><p>Druckmann is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-clarifies-comments-on-the-last-of-us-3/1100-6530414/" data-ref-id="1100-6530414">repeating himself here</a>, as he previously addressed rumors of The Last of Us: Part III by saying he treats every game like his last and that the stars would have to align for it to come about.</p><p>In 2023, after Naughty Dog canceled The Last of Us Online, the studio said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-has-two-single-player-games-in-development-described-as-ambitious-and-brand-new/1100-6519980/" data-ref-id="1100-6519980">at least two single-player games in development</a>. One has been revealed to be Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, but the other remains a mystery. Reporter Daniel Richtman said <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/1675495215103107072?t=60iERJEwrxlPeugl3EIowQ&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Last of Us: Part III is in production now.</a> For what it's worth, Druckmann has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">he has a story in mind for The Last of Us: Part III. </a></p><p>Intergalactic is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-intergalactic-wont-be-released-until-2027-at-the-soonest-report/1100-6530386/" data-ref-id="1100-6530386">not going to release until 2027 at the soonest</a>, so if The Last of Us 3 or any other one Last of Us game came after it, fans shouldn't expect to play it soon. As for The Last of Us TV series, Season 2 premieres this Sunday, April 13.</p>

One of the major highlights included in the patch notes is an adjustment for Call of Duty's frustratingly hard-to-see Terminator T-800 operator skin.</p><p dir="ltr">The Terminator T-800 operator's Endo Titanium Core skin is nerfed in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone. This specific operator skin can be very difficult to see in dark corners of the maps, and according to the patch notes, the skin received a "visibility adjustment to ease target identification."</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1909721974395519000" rel="nofollow ">post from CharlieIntel</a> shows a side-by-side comparison of the skin before and after the visual update, which players are already commenting on to express that the change wasn't drastic enough.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the update includes one of Call of Duty's new Ricochet security features for account linking. Now, any Activision ID will be required to complete a new email verification security check when connecting to a new PC platform account for the first time. Accounts that fail to complete this step will be locked from use on the PC platform until the security check is completed.

Any account that links to a new platform may be required to complete a new security challenge to verify they are in control of the account. Failure to complete the challenge will block gameplay on that platform. Players will see an in-game notification if this occurs, locking gameplay on the new platform until the authentication has been completed.</p><p>If you receive an email notification about a platform link or login attempt you did not initiate, visit CallofDuty.com to login and immediately unlink the account and update your password.</p><p>Securing your account by enabling 2FA is important, as is making sure you are not reusing passwords for your Activision ID that you would for other apps or websites. Reusing passwords on other apps or websites in connection with your email can open the door to your account being stolen or hijacked.

                <p>Despite The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker being one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-will-get-gamecube-games-through-nintendo-switch-online-new-gamecube-controller/1100-6530559/" data-ref-id="1100-6530559">GameCube games appearing on Nintendo Switch Online</a> when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> drops, that doesn't mean the Wii U version won't be ported to the Switch platform.</p><p>Kinda Funny Games asked Nintendo SVP Nate Bihldorff if having Wind Waker on Nintendo Switch Online precluded the Switch 2 getting the updated Wii U port at a later date. "[Bihldorff] was very quick to say 'no,' like, all options are on the table," said Kinda Funny host Tim Gettys. "Obviously, nothing's confirmed one way or another, but there are many examples of games that are on NSO and can still get them in a different way."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kT1tV6XowUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kT1tV6XowUs?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the list of examples is small, some include the Blaster Master and Wild Guns. Several NES and Game Boy Blaster Master games are available on NSO. However, the series was rebooted with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blaster-master-zero/" data-ref-id="5000-459308">Blaster Master Zero</a> and is available on Switch. The SNES version of Wild Guns is available on NSO, and the game received an enhanced remaster called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wild-guns-reloaded/" data-ref-id="5000-454656">Wild Guns Reloaded</a>, which is also available on Switch.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-review/1900-6414506/" data-ref-id="1900-6414506">Wii U version</a> has a bevy of new features and quality-of-life improvements that make it a much smoother experience. However, there will also be improvements to the GameCube version when it lands on Switch 2. Games can receive a resolution boost and faster loading times, as well as online multiplayer functionality.</p><p>There were rumors of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-and-wind-waker-switch-release-rumored-for-2022/1100-6503137/" data-ref-id="1100-6503137">Wind Waker and Twilight Princess</a> being ported to the first Switch several years ago, but those never came to fruition. However, it seems like that still might be possible with Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
