                <p>There's no denying that the hype train for Hollow Knight: Silksong is unlike anything we've ever seen for an indie game. In the days leading up to its release, multiple other small studios <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/">delayed their games to stay out of Silksong's way</a>, something generally reserved to make space for the Grand Theft Autos of the gaming world. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/">sequel's release led to Steam and the Nintendo eShop crashing</a> (the lack of preorders played a role here, of course) and saw the metroidvania game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-had-a-massive-steam-player-count-over-its-first-weekend/1100-6534537/">top out at 587,000 concurrent players on Valve's platform alone</a>. The game also released on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and Switch 2, plus <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/">it's available on Game Pass</a>. With that in mind, the total player numbers for Silksong are huge, showcasing that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1kgtnrh/here_are_some_epic_wholesome_100_memes_that_only/" rel="nofollow ">the online memes</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-again-missing-from-nintendo-direct/1100-6533604/">anticipation for the game to show up at events </a>were true indicators of sales success.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this said, it's begun to feel unlikely that Silksong's launch will ever be matched by another indie game. But as Yoda said: There is another.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One indie game that could take the entire gaming world by storm is Haunted Chocolatier, the follow-up to Stardew Valley. Sure, it's not a direct sequel to the perennially popular farming simulator (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">that could be in the cards eventually</a>, though). However, Haunted Chocolatier shares a similar visual presentation and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/haunted-chocolatier-will-feature-a-world-larger-than-stardew-valley/1100-6532350/">will offer a larger world than Stardew Valley</a>, according to creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone. The RPG will see people living in a haunted castle and making chocolate, which requires gathering ingredients. It's <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/faq/" rel="nofollow ">a "town game" like Stardew Valley, per Barone</a>, though Haunted Chocolatier will lean more into the action-RPG genre. Oh, and it may just be set in the same world as Stardew Valley.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/">Haunted Chocolatier was announced</a> in late 2021, so the wait has already been years long at this point--similar to Silksong. Barone has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">the game will focus on mystery and whimsy</a>, adding to the allure for an audience that loves discovering secrets on their own and through online communities. But the most obvious reason Haunted Chocolatier will be a huge event when it launches is found simply by glancing at Stardew Valley's concurrent players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/413150/charts/" rel="nofollow ">on SteamDB</a>. The farming simulator has averaged 100,000 players over the past month and, despite releasing back in 2016, peaked with <a href="http://google.com/url?q=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-hits-new-peak-concurrents-record-on-steam-thanks-to-update-1-6/1100-6521971/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1757103179812607&amp;usg=AOvVaw0LB0xGkkDRpDlhWgWBfUTo">over 235,000 people playing at the same time</a> just last year.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563777" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png" data-ref-id="1300-4563777"></a><figcaption>A screenshot from ConcernedApe's Haunted Chocolatier</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4563777-13_1247.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">When comparing the two, it quickly becomes evident that Hollow Knight doesn't swim in the same waters for Steam concurrent players as Stardew Valley. Not only does Stardew Valley have a lot of players, it has a lot of <em>engaged </em>players--ones that keep coming back to the game and help it maintain its extreme popularity. It's possibly an unfair comparison, as the former is strictly solo while the latter has co-op multiplayer. But it's also possible that Stardew Valley simply has a bigger fanbase, which could catapult Haunted Chocolatier to even greater heights than what we just witnessed with Silksong.</p><p dir="ltr">There's one other point to consider as well: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-has-a-new-best-rated-game-of-all-time/1100-6533053/">Stardew Valley is the best-rated game of all time on Steam</a>.Sure, platform availability could minimize its full impact, but Haunted Chocolatier is still primed for a monstrous debut. And if it follows suit with Stardew Valley, it could very easily start on PC before eventually coming to almost every platform, including mobile devices. Oh, and as for industry impact, it's worth bringing up that Devolver Digital co-founder Nigel Lowrie has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters" rel="nofollow ">told IGN</a> that he monitors Haunted Chocolatier in case they need to alter release plans around it.</p><p dir="ltr">However, there's also an argument that the next Silksong can't be predicted. No one ever expected Hollow Knight to be a phenomenon--just check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/on-silksong-eve-this-decade-old-hollow-knight-reddit-post-is-incredible-in-hindsight/1100-6534463/">this decade-old Reddit post about the game</a> for confirmation. Additionally, some of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/#20">the most popular Steam games of all time</a> seemingly landed out of nowhere. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-massive-new-player-milestone-year-2-promised-to-be-even-better/1100-6529574/">Palworld has seen over 32 million players</a> since coming out in early 2024, a mind-boggling number. Were you aware that there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-massive-and-inexplicably-popular-banana-game-adds-new-skins/1100-6524446/">a game called Banana on Steam</a> that sees about 100,000 players daily? Sure, it being free-to-play certainly balloons those numbers, but not many people would expect a game about clicking on a piece of fruit to create that sort of long-term engagement. The chance to collect a rare banana and possibly sell it for actual money clearly has its attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">Another recent example of this phenomenon is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/">Peak, a co-op climbing game</a> that sees players working together to ascend a mountain. Fascinatingly enough, it's the opposite of Haunted Chocolatier and Silksong from a developmental perspective. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/">Peak came together during a month-long game jam</a>, though co-developer Aggro Crab had previously pitched the concept.</p><p dir="ltr">The only thing that seems certain is that the indie space will continue to surprise us with unique experiences that might take years to land in our hands, or possibly appear <em>almost</em> magically out of thin air. Maybe Silksong is a unique moment, something that can't be replicated. Or maybe it's another landmark event that will be surpassed eventually, but not forgotten by those who experienced it.</p>

With the release of any new 2K title, the developers offer Locker Codes, which can be utilized to earn a variety of cosmetics, currency, and other rewards.</p><p>These Locker Codes are completely free to redeem. However, most of them are only active for a limited time, so you have to act quickly if you want to secure the rewards they offer. You also need to know what the Locker Codes themselves are and how to redeem them.

                <p>Nintendo's star heroine wasn't always named Princess Peach, and for many years prior to the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-64/" data-ref-id="5000-2007">Super Mario 64</a> went by a different name: Princess Toadstool. Now, fans know the reason why, and it wasn't because of any decision Nintendo made.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo veteran Leslie Swan, who over the course of her nearly three-decade career helped localize countless Nintendo classics, wrote for Nintendo Power magazine, and even voiced Princess Peach in Super Mario 64, spilled the beans on the unlikely origin of the Toadstool moniker. She said in Nintendo's early days, there wasn't a lot of communication between the development teams in Japan and those working on marketing in the US.</p><p dir="ltr">"So on Super Mario Bros. they [Nintendo] had outsourced the production of the manual to an ad agency," Swan said. "And the ad agency just kind of created names for things. And so they're the ones who came up with Princess Toadstool as the name for Peach."</p><p dir="ltr">After the ad agency's decision, the name stuck for the next decade. Swan said when localizing Super Mario 64 for North America alongside Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, Miyamoto was fond of the "Peach" name and wanted it included.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4563743"></a><figcaption>Princess Peach's letter to Mario in Super Mario 64.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4563743-mario64princesspeachletter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Swan suggested combining the two names together for the US release. Peach could be Princess Toadstool's more "informal" name, Swan said. It's for that reason Peach's letter to Mario at the beginning of Super Mario 64 is signed Princess Toadstool, with "Peach" handwritten in pink.</p><p dir="ltr">The full interview includes tons more details about Swan's career and is well worth a read. Meanwhile, Princess Peach has come into her own in recent years, stepping out of Mario's shadow. Far from a damsel in distress, she proved to be a major force in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-was-the-most-profitable-film-of-2023/1100-6523224/" data-ref-id="1100-6523224">Super Mario. Bros movie</a> and even received her own game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/princess-peach-showtime/" data-ref-id="5000-591679">Princess Peach: Showtime</a>, in 2024, the first game to star her as the main protagonist since 2006's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-princess-peach/" data-ref-id="5000-22936">Super Princess Peach</a> for Nintendo DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Peach is making a name for herself, her relationship with Mario is more complicated than ever, with Nintendo recently going out of its way to remind fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-really-wants-you-to-know-mario-and-peach-are-just-good-friends/1100-6533462/" data-ref-id="1100-6533462">Mario and Princess Peach are just "good friends."</a></p>

There hasn't been a new game in the franchise since the VR title <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wolfenstein-cyberpilot-review-falling-short/1900-6417264/" data-ref-id="1900-6417264">Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot</a> in 2019, but Machine Games creative director Axel Torvenius still wants to continue the story of William "B.J." Blazkowicz in a third Wolfenstein game.</p><p>"We have always seen this as a [Wolfenstein] trilogy," said Torvenius during a Wolfenstein documentary by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a>. "So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character. What will happen in the second one, what will happen in the third one. So I think that's important to say, because--at least, I hope--that we're not done with Wolfenstein yet. We have a story to tell."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While there's currently no word about a third Wolfenstein game, Amazon is reportedly developing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">a Wolfenstein TV series for Prime Video</a>. Kilter Films--one of the production companies behind Prime Video's Fallout series--is producing the show alongside Machine Games. Plot details are currently undisclosed, but it's believed to be based on the reboot's storyline.</p><p>Machine Games is now owned by Microsoft as part of the ZeniMax acquisition. The studio's most recent title was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which continued Wolfenstein's Nazi-fighting tradition. The first DLC expansion for the game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-order-of-giants-looks-like-the-best-of-the-great-circle-and-its-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-too/1100-6534094/" data-ref-id="1100-6534094">Indiana Jones And The Order Of Giants</a>, was released earlier this month. Machine Games and Bethesda will also port Indiana Jones and the Great Circle to Switch 2 in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax. Hines is now retired, but he's continued to share his opinions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">how he feels about Xbox Game Pass. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
