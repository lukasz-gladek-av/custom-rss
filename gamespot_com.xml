                <p>2K Games hasn't said much about its free-to-play third-person shooter currently in the works under the working title Project Ethos, but the game is not being abandoned.</p><p>2K Games shared a memo from 2K President David Ismailer today in which the executive confirmed that it has hired Ben Brinkman to take over as studio head for developer 31st Union. The company's previous boss, former Call of Duty executive Michael Condrey, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">left the studio earlier this year.</a></p><p>Ismailer said in a memo to staff that the feedback from the Project Ethos test in Fall 2024 was "enlightening" for the studio. "It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity," Ismailer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The executive said he believes the "renewed vision" for Project Ethos is one that is "poised to deliver on its promise to our players."</p><p>He went on: "Our confidence in Project Ethos grows every day."</p><p>Brinkman is a veteran of the shooter space, having most recently spent five years at Respawn as executive producer for Apex Legends. Before that, he was an executive producer for the Call of Duty series at Activision from 2008 to 2020. He's actually returning to 2K, as he was a producer at the company from July 2006 to March 2008.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">"delightfully different" but lacked an identity.</a> Exactly what this "renewed vision" is remains to be seen, nor do we know when 2K may share more details about the game or show it off again.</p><p>In February, it was reported that Project Ethos would have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">"pivot or be killed."</a></p><p>The hiring of Brinkman and "renewed vision" for Project Ethos comes just after EA announced that it was in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> official soundtrack features Limp Bizkit, and while the collaboration might seem natural given the game series is known for "breaking stuff" and Limp Bizkit has a song called "Break Stuff," the partnership wasn't planned from the onset. Henry Jackman, who scored Battlefield 6, said in an interview with Hollywood Records that he was nearly finished with the Battlefield 6 OST before wondering if a collaboration with a rock group might benefit the game.</p><p>"There is definitely a bit of a rock thing going on," he said, referring to Battlefield's iconic theme. "Would it be completely crazy... is there any mileage in trying to think of some crazy collaboration with a band... that's obviously got serious rock credentials?"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMMkacVAoFg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sMMkacVAoFg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>A partnership would also require a group to be "creatively humble enough" to work on a collaborative project that is outside their wheelhouse. So Jackman thought, "What about Limp Bizkit?"</p><p>Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst says in the video that he warmed up to the idea immediately and that his aim with contributing to the Battlefield 6 OST was to, "Follow the yellow brick road until we get to Henry..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxJfLZVjT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvxJfLZVjT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Limp Bizkit's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-features-limp-bizkit-songs-including-the-series-appropriate-break-stuff/1100-6534876/" data-ref-id="1100-6534876">"Break Stuff" was featured in a Battlefield 6 trailer</a>, and that was pretty fitting because the Battlefield series is indeed all about breaking stuff via its trademark destruction elements.</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels. It remains to be seen if Battlefield Studios can keep the momentum and engagement going, but the company has seemingly laid a strong foundation to build on.</p><p>Next up for Battlefield 6 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">launch of Season 1 on October 28</a>, and that's also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">the game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>As for the competitive landscape, EA veteran Patrick Soderlund's Embark Studios is launching its new multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-gets-free-test-for-everyone-this-weekend-on-all-platforms/1100-6535422/" data-ref-id="1100-6535422">Arc Raiders</a> on October 30, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14.</a></p>

                <p>In a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-563578">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> showcase, Gameloft has shared new info on the cozy game's upcoming Wishblossom Ranch expansion, which introduces a selection of new characters, biomes, and gameplay features when it launches on November 19. Oh, and there are a <em>lot</em> of horses.</p><p>Today's Disney Dreamlight Valley showcase gave players a glimpse at the story they can expect to experience in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, revealing that Cruella de Vil has taken control of the ranch and brought it to ruins with her villainy. At the same time, a giant flower beneath Wishblossom Ranch has been disturbed, causing wish magic to run rampant through the biomes. This expansion's tale will revolve around solving the mystery of the wish magic, as well as finding all of the missing horses that once inhabited the ranch and rebuilding it to its former glory.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBxHY3r1_bY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NBxHY3r1_bY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>Cruella de Vil isn't the only new villager coming in the expansion, though, as players will also get to befriend Tigger, Snow White, and Tinkerbell. They'll encounter these beloved Disney characters while exploring the expansion's new biome: the snow-covered Wishing Alps, Cruella-inspired Glamour Gulch, and oversized fauna-filled Pixie Acres. And as usual, each of these biomes features new critters to meet and feed, including geese, skunks, and adorable little bees.</span></p><p>Speaking of horses, Gameloft has confirmed that these majestic creatures will play a huge part in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, both in terms of story progression and as rideable mounts. In addition to working with and riding horses from Disney films--such as Tangled, Mulan, and Hercules--you'll even be able to customize horses with a wide variety of flairs to make them uniquely your own.</p><p>The horse-related elements aren't exclusively about customization and leisurely rides, though. Horses also bring new ways to work around the valley, as they allow you to run through Night Thorns, Splinters of Fate, Inkies, and brand-new Dead Wish Blossoms to clear them away. And your horse can even stomp the ground to dig holes, hold a watering can to water your crops, and kick mining nodes to help you collect gems.</p><p>The good news doesn't stop at having a helping hand (hoof?) around the valley, either. Unlike previous expansions, which were split into multiple parts that released over the course of a year, Wishblossom Ranch will release all of its content on day one. This means all four villagers and the full story will be available right away, incentivizing players to get to work rebuilding Wishblossom Ranch at their own pace.</p><p>For existing players, the standard version of the Wishblossom Ranch expansion will come with 5,000 moonstones--the game's premium currency--while the Deluxe Edition will come with 10,000 moonstones, the Arendellian Riding Outfit and Snowy Alpine House Style cosmetic items, and an exclusive Sven mount from the film Frozen. And yes, Sven is rideable!</p><p>Meanwhile, new players can purchase a Wishblossom Ranch Edition of Disney Dreamlight Valley that comes with the base game and the expansion, or opt for the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, Wishblossom Ranch with all Deluxe Edition bonuses, and all previous expansions.</p><p>Lastly, anyone who purchases any version of Wishblossom Ranch between November 19 and December 3 will receive the Springtime Festival Outfit and Festival Tack cosmetic items for free.</p><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley's Wishblossom Ranch expansion launches November 19 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC. We've also learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-teases-cinderella-new-dreamteam-multiplayer-feature-and-2026-updates/1100-6535429/" data-ref-id="1100-6535429">Cinderella is coming to DDV</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> has long been one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">best horror games</a> to play, but in its next update, it's going to get even scarier. Coming in a patch on October 21, Invasion mode is adding an optional PvP mode to the game for the first time, and the way developer Red Barrels has designed it adds a ton of horror and paranoia to the experience.</p><p>As devoted players already know, the normally PvE co-op horror game can be disrupted by "impostors," NPC characters who appear on the map as violent doppelgangers. These impostors are caught somewhat easily by their tell-tale laughs--they don't easily fool experienced players, though their behaviors have grown more sophisticated since the game first launched. But Invasion mode is about to overhaul that element in a major way.</p><p>During Invasion rounds, an enemy team of up to four players can join a game as impostors, taking turns infiltrating the round while disguised as players on the other team and armed with a kitchen knife. When waiting to spawn in, impostors can spy on the other team using security cameras, while those players can break the cameras as a counter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339" data-ratio="0.55786163522013" data-width="1590" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339"></a><figcaption>Invasion mode brings even more paranoia to a game that already loves toying with players' sense of safety.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png"></figure><p>It's the goal of the impostor team to sabotage the mission for the other side. Gone are the impostors' signature laughs that would give away the ruse, and impostors can even unlock a number of unique skills that will help them move faster, blend in better, and kill more efficiently. In the final moments of a round, all impostors are released onto the map, adding a final touch of chaos. In an added bit of fun, impostors can hear a moment of their victim's voice comms just before they kill them off, too.</p><p>I recently played a live preview of the mode and it was the scariest thing I've experienced in the game to date. At the same time, it was hilarious, in that "I'm so nervous, I'm laughing" sort of way. Each round of Invasion becomes fully enveloped in an air of paranoia. Even just working with another player on your team becomes an unnerving exercise. I didn't feel safe turning my back to my allies, because they may have been killers only wearing their face.</p><p>The mode looks like it'll be a hit for the horror game, and it comes alongside a bigger update that also adds an in-game shop, new missions, and the annual Halloween event, Geister. Twitch Drops are coming for the first time, too. All of these things come bundled in the October 21 game patch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

                <p>Nearly two years ago, Rockstar Games shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, one of the most highly anticipated titles in the history of the video game industry. Since then, numerous analysts and gaming industry figures have speculated or openly wished for the game to be sold for $100 in order for other AAA games to reach the same price. Now, Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has shared his wish for GTA 6 to be $100 as well, but not for the same reason as some of his peers.</p><p>"They're the only ones that can get away with it," said Stockman during an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Esports Insider</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "I don't think it's a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that [there will] be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100. The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</p><p>Earlier this year, Wedbush Securities argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">selling GTA 6 at $100 could benefit players</a> by giving them a massive amount of in-game currency for GTA Online. Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott disagreed and said it was a bad idea because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise. Elliott also cited the rising cost of living as a primary reason not to charge players a higher price than the industry standard. Most of the newer AAA games are now going for $70.</p><p>Take-Two was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-defends-nba-2k21s-price-increase/1100-6482168/" data-ref-id="1100-6482168">among the first publishers to raise its prices from $60 to $70 back in 2020</a>. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">non-committal about raising prices</a> again during an investor call in August.</p><p>"We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing," said Zelnick. "So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>
