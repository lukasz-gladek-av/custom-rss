<section><p>"We have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets," Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller told GameSpot in an exclusive interview.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Without being hyperbolic--and as someone who has been an on-and-off again Overwatch fan since the original game's release back in 2016--I don't mean it lightly when I say that I believe Overwatch has never been better.</p><p dir="ltr">I've critiqued the series quite a bit throughout the years. In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/overwatch-2-review-same-as-it-ever-was/1900-6417972/">Overwatch 2 review</a>, I wrote at length about how it felt "detached from the principles and charm of the original," was seemingly struggling to retain its identity, and how its new monetization models felt disingenuous and "at odds with the spirit of the original Overwatch." Harsh words, yes, but I meant them. I was frustrated by what one of my all-time favorite games had become, and worried that I'd be chasing the same bliss I felt playing in 2017 endlessly and to no avail.</p><p dir="ltr">So, with all that said, how did we get here?</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to discuss the state of Overwatch 2 with game director Aaron Keller and associate game director Alec Dawson in an exclusive interview for GameSpot, and it seems a lot of this dramatic turn-around boils down to two things: an increased emphasis on responding to player feedback, and a sharp pivot away from the "conservative" mentality the Overwatch 2 team once clung to. The result is a vastly improved game that is taking big swings with more efficiency.</p><p dir="ltr">Be it Stadium mode, Perks, the inclusion of heroes with never-before-tried mechanics, map voting, hero bans, or one of the many other tweaks and additions made to the game, Blizzard is not shying away from shaking up Overwatch 2's core gameplay loop; Season 18 is no exception. And according to Keller and Dawson, all these changes are just the beginning of the studio's push to "explore how big" Overwatch can become.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: A lot of changes have happened this year in Overwatch 2, so I would love to start by unpacking that with you both. How do you think things are going? How are you feeling about the overall health of the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>When you look at the way that 2025 has gone for the game, we've done a lot of big releases. Earlier this year, we released our Perk system, which was a pretty substantial game mechanic that changed the way moment-to-moment gameplay can happen. It gave players more strategic choices that they could make over the course of a match and put more emphasis on what a hero can do and [fulfilling] that power fantasy.</p><p dir="ltr">In Season 16, we released Stadium. It's probably the biggest new game mode we've ever introduced to the game and there was a lot of player excitement there. We've done a lot of other things, too. We introduced hero bans this year. We introduced map voting this year. We've introduced a new hero as well, with another one soon to come.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of players are now telling us that this is the best state that Overwatch has ever been in and we think that some of that is because we're making bigger changes to the game than we typically would have in the past. If you look back on the history of Overwatch, you could say that maybe we're a little bit conservative, but we have a new mindset and a new vision for how we operate the game. [We want] to be taking bigger swings and bigger bets with Overwatch, and I think you'll see that when we get to Season 18.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556086"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556086-ow2_s18_stadium_abilities_brigitte_kaptensweden.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's great to hear. Touching on that, I would love to hear a little bit more about what's coming tomorrow in Season 18.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>We look at Season 18 as sort of the next steps for a number of the big swings we've taken this year. There's around 60 new Perks that are brand new--every hero gets [a refresh]. Quick play is coming to Stadium, and then you have four new heroes coming: Brigitte, Winston, Farah, and then Tracer.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of what we're doing in [Season] 18 [stems from] evaluating what's in the game currently and evolving it in some way and/or even revamping it. Our progression system is a great example. It's been one of those things that's been in the game for a bit now, but there's a lot of screen space that players weren't really caring about; a lot of bars going up, a lot of things you're leveling up. We want to simplify it--make sure it's a lot more visible, make sure it's a lot more surfaced.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>We are doing a total revamp to our progression system. When you looked at our progression system before, it kind of just felt like there were just a bunch of bars going up all the time. It was pretty complex and so we've simplified it. But the exciting thing about it is that, not only is it easier to understand, but it has a lot of cool new rewards too.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a whole rewards track where you're updating things like emotes and Play of the Game [intros]--even loot boxes and legendary loot boxes. There's a whole Ascended State where you get a really cool icon with VFX on it that lets you and other players know just how much time you've put into each one of your heroes. We have a new Hero [Skill Rating] system coming out, so you're going to know how good [you are] not just at a [particular] role, but how well you play each of your heroes in Competitive. You can see which ones you're better at, and which ones you're worse at. We also have a new advanced hero info panel, where you can look up stats on what all of the different heroes do.</p><p dir="ltr">We're bringing Stadium to Quick Play, which is one of the biggest requests that our players have for the mode, and that's coming with cross-play enabled. We have four new heroes coming to Stadium, a new game mode, Payload Race, and two brand new maps for it. You mentioned Wuyang, our new support hero, is coming, and we have changes to Roadhog too. Lucio Ball is back--this time in third-person--and there's mouse and keyboard support coming to console.</p><p dir="ltr">We even have [things] on the cosmetic side. Kiriko's getting this skateboard emote [that lets her] travel around the maps riding a skateboard. The Mythic [Character] skins and Mythic Weapon skins are really cool this season… It's a huge update to Overwatch. This is going to be one of the biggest seasons we've ever had for the game.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Is this the biggest update in terms of sheer content? Because I feel like, based on what you're saying, I don't know if there's ever been an update quite this big.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I don't want to jump into hyperbole and say like this is the biggest one coming, but man, it's… it is big.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>There's truth to that, though, to some degree. I think our team has been getting better and better about structuring our seasons to where, now, we can create some really big beats. Season 9 felt like a big change in the game, and then they went to Season 12 which had Juno and a bunch of competitive updates. 15 and 16 [added] Perks and Stadium. And now 18, is another massive update for Overwatch. We've been getting a lot more efficient and a lot better at planning over time, which has led to these big moments for Overwatch. [We can now] decide, like, "Hey, how do we want to change the game for the middle of the year?"</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556085"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556085-ovr_pk_s18_h44_aqua_beautyshot_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I can sense that. Even with your newest hero, Wuyang--he feels extremely different.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Yeah, there's a lot of unique mechanics and abilities with Wuyang that I just think it'd be great to touch on. He can surf on his own private wave and cruise around the map. He gets this speed boost with it, too, and is able to jump over gaps and things like that. He can use his staff to create this wave of water in front of him that knocks down enemies, and can turn himself or allies basically into ticking time bombs by imbuing them with water. But what I'm most excited about with Wuyang is his primary fire. He shoots out this orb, and you can kind of do it rapid fire, but at any moment, you can also take control of it and steer it, turning it into a guided missile. Even if they take cover, you can actually bend it around a corner. There's some skill expression here. It takes a little bit of practice to actually be able to do it, but once you get it, it feels so satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> I think he's one of the best support heroes we've ever made. He's an example of what a support is in Overwatch 2, where you can have a ton of impact through your offense and can make game-changing plays. Wuyang is dynamic in the sense that he has to go from offense to defense quite quickly. All of your attention is gonna be on the primary fire, landing some of those shots, and tracking people down, but then you have these defensive options that you're going to [need to] be really timely with. His guardian wave is this big wave that gives healing and gives heal boosts--it can change the fight instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">I think players are going to really love him. I know we're not supposed to play favorites, but he's a joy to play with and I think he's really special.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I think he's also one of the first heroes where his skills and powers feel almost more magical rather than technological, right? I feel like Overwatch historically has always leaned more into tech rather than magic. Was that a conversation that had to be had when developing him?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>Oh yeah, and we have those conversations all the time. We had those conversations a lot with both Hanzo and Genji, you know, because when they summon the dragon, that feels like a pretty magical thing there as well. We do have our own internal explanations for that that we'll actually get into at some point with our players, but we're not quite ready to yet. I guess all I can really say right now is that Overwatch is a science fiction game, and so there is an explanation behind the way those work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>At this point, do you feel like you're still fighting that initial nature of being conservative? Like you both said, for a long time, Overwatch was more conservative. Are you still fighting that hesitation or is it like, "Nope, we're all in"?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I think the team has left a lot of the hesitation about being conservative behind. The question for us really is, how big do we go with releases for Overwatch? Because there's two sides of this coin. There's an active player base that really appreciates the way that the game plays right now, you know. But we also see that, anytime we do make a big release for the game, players respond to it really positively.</p><p dir="ltr">So we want to keep going big. I think what we want to do is explore how big we really can go for Overwatch. And I think as we hit seasons like 18 here, and we see players' excitement, that gives us the confidence to know this isn't just the right direction--this is something that we can expand on in the future. We can keep pushing the boundaries of what a release for Overwatch can be.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>With the implementation of Stadium, did you see a spike in people playing Overwatch 2? If so, how is retention following that?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>There was a <em>huge</em> spike of people jumping into Stadium when it first came out. I think we went public at one point saying that over 50% of play hours in Overwatch were in Stadium. And when we do have new modes for the game, we do always see that initial burst of excitement and then it'll kind of taper off after that. And Stadium did taper off, but not to the extent that our other modes have. It's still, I think, our third most popular mode in the game right now, just behind Quick Play and Competitive.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson:</strong> We view Stadium as one of the main ways to play Overwatch, and Season 18 as almost Stadium's 1.0 launch. A lot of players are clamoring to have Quick Play in there. They're clamoring for something that's a little bit more brief and doesn't have a rank associated with it. So with Quick Play, it's a best-of-five round structure and you power up your hero even faster as well.</p><p dir="ltr">And then the other main piece of feedback from players is, "Hey, my favorite hero isn't here." So we're continuing to release new heroes into Stadium. We're going to be doing that throughout the rest of the year and there's four this season who I'm really excited about. Tracer in particular. I think… She's a little wild.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I'm super excited about Winston jumping into Stadium. I love playing as him and using his mobility. Sometimes with Winston, you just feel like you're holding down primary fire a little bit too long to actually be doing what you want to do. [With Stadium], you can really juice his gun and it feels so satisfying.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556087"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556087-ow2_s18_stadium_3pview_winston.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>How did you land on those four heroes and what are some other heroes who you see people clamoring for and are on the docket? If you can't say right now, can you share what gameplay styles you're focused on bringing in?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> There's a lot of things we look at when we're looking at heroes for Stadium. First and foremost is how well we feel like we can make a really cool set of abilities for them. We want every hero in there to really double down on "hero fantasy." We want to make sure that comes across to our players.</p><p dir="ltr">For the first few seasons of Stadium, we really tried to have at least a few heroes per role. Eventually, I think we're going to have to break that pattern and start moving into other patterns. I think we'll start seeing, you know, maybe different numbers of heroes coming to Stadium with different role ratios.</p><p dir="ltr">We want to make sure that heroes that we know a lot of people play are available there. Like Alex said, you know, we have a lot of people saying things like, "Hey, I'm just sitting on the sidelines, waiting for my hero to join the cast." So we want to make sure that we're opening up that funnel.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a few heroes we're avoiding, you know? Like Widowmaker, who is a controversial hero that's designed around a one-shot [kill]. I think that there's probably some learnings we need to do with how we build those heroes--how we build counters for some of the sharper mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There was a recent IGN article in which you said that you'd "dropped the ball with story in Overwatch 2," and I thought that was interesting to bring up this far removed from the announcement of PvE being dropped. So do you have plans to course-correct going forward?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> Yeah. When you look back at the history of Overwatch, there are moments where there was more or less lore--where we were developing more or less story for players. And one of the things that we hear from our community--and we've been hearing it a lot lately--is that they just want there to be more of that in the game. That it feels like we're doing less of it.</p><p dir="ltr">So I think I'm actually really excited for the Wuyang hero trailer to come out and for people to get a glimpse at that hero and maybe how they tie into the bigger, broader universe. It's something that I can't really go into a lot right now, but I'm excited for players to be able to get in touch with more lore over the coming seasons this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Based on that, do you plan on having more heroes come from similar factions or the same countries? I know that, for a while there, there was more avoidance since you're trying to represent a lot of different backgrounds. But at the same time--and with the lack of PvE--do you find yourself thinking "Well actually let's add this person's best friend and have more storytelling through voice lines?" Or "Let's try to add folks from the same factions."</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dawson: </strong>Yeah, there's a delicate balance to it. We don't want to make it feel like heroes are appearing out of nowhere and like [players always have] this brand-new thing to learn. I think we've created a universe over quite some time that is very rich with tons of different characters from different factions, and we want to lean into that more and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some of the things you saw in the Freya story trailer earlier this year link back to some of the things we've already built in the world. We want to make sure that we're pulling from that world because there are characters that people have only gotten glimpses of, that they love, or that could end up as heroes one day.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>As far as where our heroes hail from, we do still like to spread heroes out across like all over the globe. That's a really important value that we've got. We do like our heroes to feel like they represent Earth, but not in the strictest sense. We don't have 40% of our heroes from China and India, which is maybe what a true representation of the global population would be.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556088"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4556088-ovr_pk_s15_h43_freja_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Has the team considered any other avenues for more large-scale storytelling? I'm sure you see the success of series like Arcane and Castlevania on Netflix, and I wonder if that has been something that you're interested in pursuing.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller:</strong> The team would love to have something like that come out. You know, we're also fans of those shows and fans of those universes. To have something like that for Overwatch would be really, really cool. But I can't really discuss the plans for future stuff like that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I completely understand. I just ask because it's something that I want to manifest into the universe. But on the subject of Overwatch's story--and now that we're a little bit more removed from what happened--do you want to go into a little bit more detail on why things didn't really work out with story missions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Keller: </strong>I know Blizzard holds their cards kind of close to their chests sometimes. But I don't think we really saw the critical success that we wanted and it forced us to really analyze where we were putting our time and resources. At the end of the day, what we've been telling our players is that we want to make the game that they want to play. And the game that our players have been playing is this competitive, PvP-focused hero shooter. We really realized that that was the game that we needed to invest our time into.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the release of our sole campaign, we did a really big pivot internally on the team. We wanted to focus on what it means to be a best-in-class hero shooter. What are the competitive systems that we need in order to do that? What are some of the other systems?</p><p dir="ltr">In the year since that, we've focused on evolving the game our players play--on how we turn it into the best version of Overwatch it can be. That's why we started doing these much bigger systems, like Perks and Stadium. Now that we've corrected the course, it gives us the opportunity to make bigger steps with the game. And some of those are things that players are asking for, but then some of them are really big surprises. That's the future for Overwatch right now.</p><p><em>The above interview has been lightly edited for clarity, readability, and brevity.</em></p>

                <p>Fans of cooperative climbing game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a> know that ticks aren't the only bug in the game, and for the last week they've been subject to a particularly frustrating one that developers are now aware of and working to resolve: the brand new biome, the Mesa, has been missing for the last week, with only the original Alpine biome showing up in the game's seed-generated maps.</p><p>"For the last 7 days, every map has had the ALPINE," developer Team Peak wrote in a post on the game's Steam page. "Players are starting to wonder if the MESA was a dream all along. A mirage."</p><p>The developers chalk this up to one of two potential causes. One is that "[the game's map generator] randomly rolled ALPINE 7 days in a row which has a 0.78% chance of happening." While that's possible, they submit another potential cause: "Orrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr its (<em>sic)</em> a bug."</p><p>For the last week, climbers have been subjected to the bitter, whipping cold of the Alpine biome. But sometimes you'd rather free solo El Capitan than the north face of the Eiger. To give us all a break from the cold, the team is forcing Mesa as the game's third biome "until further notice," which they specify will be later this week.</p><p>On the beta side of the game, the developers are working on reenabling rising lava in the final level, the Kiln, and testing a photosensitive mode.</p><p>Previously, the team has been working to quickly update the game with new features, with the most recent being getting the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/peak-is-now-steam-deck-verified-and-the-cannon-glitch-is-fixed/1100-6534220/" data-ref-id="1100-6534220">Steam Deck Verified checkmark</a> on their game, as well as adding optional cannibalism to the game in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cute-climbing-game-peaks-latest-totally-normal-update-adds-in-totally-not-normal-cannibalism/1100-6533552/" data-ref-id="1100-6533552">Totally Normal Update</a> and adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-peak-update-adds-a-hot-biome-that-will-have-players-packing-sunscreen/1100-6533840/" data-ref-id="1100-6533840">aforementioned Mesa biome</a>.

As the name implies, this will include the PS5 Slim model with a disc drive, a DualSense controller, and the upcoming NBA 2K26. It's arriving on September 5, the same day NBA 2K26 launches on PS5, Xbox, PC, and Nintendo Switch. We're still waiting on pricing details for the new bundle, but considering Sony <strong>increased the PS5's price on August 21</strong>, we're expecting it to be more expensive than previous bundles. Still, bundles like this are always popular, so set a reminder for September 5 if you're thinking about picking one up.</p><div title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4175" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534210 - PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/blog.playstation.com\/2025\/08\/22\/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/22/nba-2k26-hands-on-report-and-ps5-bundle-details-launching-september-5/">Pricing TBA</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Slim NBA 2K26 Bundle pulls together a PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Controller, and a digital voucher for NBA 2K26.

The base PS5 Slim now costs $550 (was $500) and PS5 Slim Digital costs $500 (was $450--and before that was $400 at launch), we're expecting this to be pricier than previous bundles. For example, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-this-ps5-slim-digital-console-bundle-for-400-before-hardware-price-increases/1100-6534138/" data-ref-id="1100-6534138">PS5 Slim Digital Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Bundle</a> was previously available for just $400, offering a value of $570. The bundle didn't last long at that promotional price, and we'd expect this upcoming NBA 2K26 bundle to be much more expensive. At the very least, we're hoping the bundle ends up being cheaper than buying everything individually. Expect to learn more as we quickly approach its September 5 release date. Availability of the bundle will vary by region. Most markets should find it on PlayStation Direct, though other local retailers may also have inventory.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're worried about pricing--or don't need NBA 2K26, consider grabbing a PS5 at Amazon.

                <p>Besides creating many iconic cult movies like Halloween, The Thing, and Escape From New York, you may also be aware that filmmaker John Carpenter is an ardent fan of video games. Has he then finally decided to make one? Well, yes and no. Toxic Commando may bear his name in the title, but the real credit goes to developer and publisher Saber Interactive. Still, after playing this apocalyptic co-op first-person shooter for the first time at Gamescom 2025, I see how it bears his influence. This isn't just a cynical marketing stunt to put his name on the box.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to kind of tap into those '80s horror and over-the-top action films like Big Trouble in Little China, so we reached out to Carpenter, who was like, 'Yeah, this is great,'" said Saber's chief creative officer, Tim Willits. "He's played the game with us, he's helped with some concepts, he's been good about saying, 'Focus on these types of things when you tell this type of story.'"</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahDfS-wDsmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ahDfS-wDsmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">It may be more accurate to describe Carpenter as having more of a consulting role rather than being deeply involved in development. But his role is also more hands-on at least in some areas: The director famously composed some of the themes for his own influential movies, and has written music that will be incorporated into the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While not directly referencing Carpenter's back catalog, the story of Toxic Commando, about a corporation seeking a new limitless power source that unwittingly awakens an evil entity, is totally the kind of idea I can imagine he might have conceived of in the peak of his filmmaking career--this evil is even named the Sludge God, which is as unapologetically B-movie as it gets.</p><p dir="ltr">Our four-player session was less focused on the story than it was on just diving into the gameplay itself. Willits recommends the best way to catch up on the backstory is through the comic book prequels Saber has produced in partnership with Dark Horse Comics.</p><p dir="ltr">"The story is very fun and quirky, but it does not get in the way," he said, though those who do want to get immersed in the story can also opt to solo the game with computer-controlled bots as teammates. That should provide a better way to appreciate the moment-to-moment chatter with the other titular commandos--the laid-back Walter, the nihilistic Ruby, the empathetic Cato, and the natural leader Astrid--each played by small-screen actors whose likenesses have also been faithfully rendered in-game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556049"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556049-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_08.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Although a session cannot have everyone picking the same character, they're not bound to specific roles on the team like in, say, a hero shooter. Every player gets to have their own personal journey in terms of loadout and classes. The latter mostly refers to the mutant abilities you have equipped from a device strapped to your chest that's keeping you from being corrupted by the Sludge God's infection. Usually, this means being able to drop area-of-effect fields that your buddies can stay in to improve their defense or offense, the kind of boost you'd want when facing down hordes of undead. There's also no restriction if everyone in your party decides to play a support class, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, when it's a co-op FPS that involves blasting zombies, thoughts of Left 4 Dead aren't far behind. However, the shooter I ended up thinking about as we took on our demo mission was actually Halo, Saber having also had a hand in that game's anniversary edition remaster. Not only was the map we roamed a pretty large sandbox, with plenty of optional areas to explore and also mark with pins, we could also get around in vehicles. These are randomized in each session, so you might come across a pick-up truck or an ambulance van, or find an armored vehicle where someone can get onto the gun turret while the camera pulls back in third person for the driver. It has the same joy as piling onto a Warthog with your buddies.</p><p dir="ltr">There are some considerations to keep in mind with the vehicles you drive, though--they need gas to run, so you might need to find fuel to top up the tank. A turret also has limited ammo, so you won't be able to use it indefinitely. Some vehicles might not have the tires to handle going up some steep and muddy slopes, and it's impressive how Toxic Commando essentially makes use of the tech seen in Saber's off-road driving sims like Mudrunner and Snowrunner to give vehicles different capabilities in a variety of situations. Again, the armored vehicles are the most capable for getting around, and come with a very handy winch that can be used for pulling down barriers in the way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556051"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556051-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_03.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The real technical star of the show, however, is Saber's proprietary Swarm Engine. Originally created for World War Z's huge zombie hordes, and impressively utilized for the swarm of Tyranids in Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2, Willits said the engine has evolved to even greater heights in Toxic Commando.</p><p dir="ltr">"The environments are much larger than they were in World War Z, so the swarms come in all sorts of different directions," he explained. "We have more super creatures, special monsters, but just like our upgrade progression system in World War Z and Space Marine 2, you have different classes and you can upgrade your abilities, loadouts, even some of your passives."</p><p dir="ltr">That also ensures there's never a dull moment. When following the objective of destroying specific tendril nodes so that we could reach a church, we encountered a swarm of undead. But even when exploring other points of interest, the engine keeps the map populated with enemies so that there's always something to shoot or contend with while trying to find loot and stock up on supplies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556054"></a><figcaption>Toxic Commando</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556054-toxic_commando_4k_screenshot_logo_05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At times, the non-stop hordes can get overwhelming. Case in point: Toward the end of the mission, we reached the church and had to endure a siege of undead coming from all directions. Willits said Toxic Commando is probably the most difficult game the studio has made in years, given how much the action can ramp up. But that difficulty is managed in real-time by the Swarm Engine's AI director that's designed to also make you feel like the odds are against you.</p><p dir="ltr">"It keeps track of who you're fighting and balances the difficulty," he explained. "When you're playing and feel like, 'My god, I'm not going to survive,' and then you just pull through at the last second, a lot of that is the AI director."</p><p dir="ltr">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Turok knows a thing or two about rebirth. The original character debuted in a 1950s comic book but came to wider attention after Valiant Comics revived him as Turok: Dinosaur Hunter in the early '90s. It was this comic that became the basis for the game series that began on the N64, which was arguably the most influential console-based shooter of the time after GoldenEye. Following 17 years of dormancy after the mixed reception of its 2008 self-titled reboot (while it wasn't actually a commercial flop, a sequel was nonetheless canned), Saber Interactive has stepped up to the plate to make the cycle begin anew with Turok: Origins.</p><p dir="ltr">I was admittedly skeptical when it was first announced at last year's Game Awards, as it seemed to be a third-person co-op shooter. The good news from my first hands-on at Gamescom 2025 is that the game can be played in both first- and third-person, and while this preview session was about getting a feel for the co-op PvE gameplay for up to three players, members of Saber Interactive's Madrid-based team assured us that it will also be possible to play the game solo without AI allies, so as to stay true to the original single-player experience of the series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUPvMp_s5nc" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUPvMp_s5nc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>But most importantly, Turok: Origins gets back to the fundamental core of what you want from a Turok game: killing dinosaurs with big guns.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are, of course, some twists to that formula. As the subtitle suggests, this is a revival that goes back in the timeline, to well before the original game. Turok isn't the name of a character but rather a tribe of hunters, while still very much taking its inspiration from tribes indigenous to North America. As you would expect from a team-based game, you have a choice of different classes to play as, each inspired by different spirit animals--Raven, Cougar, and Bison--which dictate the loadout and abilities you have, though you're free to change classes before each mission starts.</p><p dir="ltr">The dinos are actually referred to as Xenia, a hostile reptilian force that's predominantly made up of familiar four-legged lizards, though this also gives license to introduce some more humanoid enemies, as well as what could be best described as a troll with scales. But wisely, the first mission in this demo gave me what I wanted from the outset, which was to drop us into a prehistoric-looking jungle while being jumped by waves of raptors. They were a blast to dispatch, whether I was playing with a first- or third-person perspective, which is something that you can seamlessly switch between. The third-person option also lets you toggle which shoulder the camera is behind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556040"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556040-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot6_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The reason behind the controls feeling so good may be down to the developer confirming that the pipelines for first-person and third-person are actually separate, so they do feel distinct. You can also see some differences such as how, when hitting crouch while sprinting, you'll perform a slide in first-person but roll forward when in third-person. Melee is also an option, and even when playing in first-person, the camera will always pull back to third-person. I can see how this is more ideal for performing a variety of brutal cinematic finishers; when you've weakened a dino to the point they're glowing yellow, your prompt to move in as your hunter rips them apart from their long jaw.</p><p dir="ltr">As cool as some of these execution animations were, I couldn't do them as often as I wanted, mostly because another teammate was still raining ammo on them and finished them off before I could press the prompt in time. In a subsequent mission inside an ancient temple, the team was able to split up to tackle threats coming from different directions, which gave me more opportunity to dispatch Xenia as I saw fit. At the same time, I was also trying out each of the available, first with the automatic-toting Cougar, and then the tankier Bison and their close-range shotgun.</p><p dir="ltr">Each class also has three unique cooldown-based abilities as well as an ultimate, typical of modern class-based shooters. After a couple of missions, I found my groove with Raven's long range bow, and I was pulling off many satisfying headshots. One downside, though, was if I didn't kill them instantly, then I'd be too far away to run in for the killing blow. Despite this, it was with this Raven class that I used their abilities with the most confidence, including one where they charged up a sort of rallying cry that instantly killed weak enemies, summoned a swarm of glowing wasps to attack a nearby target, or created a temporary barrier against projectiles.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556041"></a><figcaption>Turok: Origins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1853/18530236/4556041-turokorigins_gamescomscreenshot1_logo%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I nonetheless did return to Cougar for the demo's final encounter, an arena boss fight against a huge Triceratops that almost had a whiff of Monster Hunter about it. With my medium-ranged auto-plasma shots, it was a good way of landing hits from a distance while being able to dodge when it charged at me with its horns. The Cougar's ultimate is also especially useful by temporarily granting you a very powerful bow that you can let loose an infinite supply of arrows.</p><p dir="ltr">There was quite a lot to take in, as the developer ushered us through a varied and curated experience within 30 minutes. To ensure a tight pace, the dev made everyone gather in a glowing blue circle when it was time to advance to the next part of a mission--which also meant some optional paths were deliberately walled off for the demo. Even in this more linear structure, however, I still had the opportunity to use my grapple to swing up over certain walls or jump up to higher ground to take down out-of-reach enemies. That kind of platforming traversal is another hallmark from the original Turok games that carries over here.</p><p dir="ltr">While I would still prefer to be able to get the chance to experience Turok: Origins in a single-player scenario, this first hands-on has nonetheless put aside any initial doubts I might have had. In Saber Interactive Spain's hands, a franchise many had assumed would remain a fossil looks like it's getting a revival that could actually stick around this time.</p><p dir="ltr">Turok: Origins is coming soon to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>XSEED Games has announced that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack is coming to Switch consoles</a> in the US on October 28. The Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack collects the four visual novels in the Heavenly Host saga--which includes Corpse Party, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash, and Corpse Party: Blood Drive. It also marks the first time Corpse Party: Book of Shadows and Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash will be playable on Switch. All four games in the collection are presented with their original Japanese voiceover and English subtitles and are enhanced with high-definition graphics and audio. Preorders are available now for $50 exclusively at Amazon. The Corpse Party series rarely gets physical releases, so we're expecting the collection to sell out quickly.</p><div title="6534238 - Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack Switch Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4198" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534238 - Corpse Party Tetralogy Pack Switch Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FN69MYW3?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$50 | Releases October 28</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Corpse Party: Tetralogy Pack includes all four remastered visual novels in the collection on a physical Nintendo Switch card. Once again, the four games included are:</p><ul><li>Corpse Party (2021)</li><li>Corpse Party: Book of Shadows (2011)</li><li>Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash (2012)</li><li>Corpse Party: Blood Drive (2014)</li></ul><p>Like other Switch releases, the physical edition will also be playable on Nintendo Switch. Physical copies for this collection are available exclusively at Amazon. Digital preorders are also available.</p></div>                      </div><p>For those unfamiliar, Corpse Party is a series of supernatural horror visual novels with branching outcomes, multiple endings, and plenty of scares and gruesome murders. The first game, Corpse Party, tells the story of a friendship ritual gone horrifically awry after it transports high school student Ayumi Shinozaki and her friends to an alternate reality. Exploring the Heavenly Host Elementary institution, the group has to risk their sanity and safety to uncover the truth behind bone-chilling murders that occurred at the location, if they ever want to return home again. The version included in the collection is the 2021 version of the game that was released for PC, which itself is actually the third remake of Corpse Party originally released for the PS Vita in 2010.</p><p>The next game, Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, is an ambitious anthology series released in 2011 that served as a sequel, prequel, midquel, <em>and</em> an alternate universe tale, all in one package. It builds on the events of the first game, offering players new perspectives on several of the original game's most critical events.</p><p>2012's Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko's Hysteric Birthday Bash is billed as a midquel set that takes place during the events of Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows. It tells the story of the ghost of Sachiko Shinozaki’s murderous birthday party at Heavenly Host Elementary.</p><p>Finally, Corpse Party: Blood Drive was released in 2014 and is set two months after Book of Shadows. Designed to be the ultimate conclusion to the Heavenly Host story arc, the story revolves around black magic, the end of the world, and a mission to resurrect fallen friends.</p><p>While Corpse Party: Blood Drive was the final game in the Heavenly Host story arc, it's not the end of the franchise. A spiritual sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/corpse-party-2-darkness-distortion-preorder-guide/1100-6522304/" data-ref-id="1100-6522304">Corpse Party 2: Darkness Distortion</a>, is set to launch in Jun 2026--giving you enough time to catch up on the previous four games with the new collection. Darkness Distortion will once again be a visual novel, this time following three high school friends as they explore the Amare Est Vivere Hospital to see if a local urban legend is true.

"Nintendo seems to be almost discouraging Switch 2 development to some degree, where I've spoken with plenty of developers where they were either told that their game, they should just ship it on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility," said John Linneman, a senior staff writer for Digital Foundry. "There’s a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at Gamescom this year and so many of them said the same things." GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Cyberpunk 2077 Is A Good Showcase For The Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing story surrounding Switch 2 from before launch and even as recently as last month. In April, a report surfaced stating that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smaller-game-studios-are-struggling-to-get-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-report/1100-6530621/">small developers were struggling to get their hands on dev kits for the hybrid system</a>. But it's not just indie teams, as a July report pointed to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lack-of-switch-2-dev-kits-could-explain-limited-third-party-game-announcements-report/1100-6533186/">some AAA studios having a hard time acquiring them</a>, too. This could be why there haven't been a slew of major third-party releases, or announcements, for the system lately.</p><p dir="ltr">Oliver Mackenzie, a contributor at Digital Foundry, touched on AAA studios possibly still not getting Switch 2 dev kits. "But like there's that campfire game, you know the kind of camera campfire game, and they're getting kits, and some big developers on the other hand, who developed like AAA stuff, aren’t necessarily in the pipeline there for kits," said Mackenzie. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/chillin-by-the-fire-out-today-on-switch-2-allows-you-to-chill-by-a-fire/1100-6533581/">Chillin by the Fire is the game</a> that Mackenzie is referencing, and it launched right after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/#1">the Nintendo Direct in July</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/">Switch 2 has broken home console sales records</a> since launching June 5. In fact, at the start of this month, Nintendo revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">Switch 2 has already sold 6 million units</a>. Looking ahead, there are rumblings about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-coming-this-september-report/1100-6534229/" data-ref-id="1100-6534229">a possible Nintendo Direct set for mid-September</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Nearly 25 years from its initial release on the Nintendo Gamecube, Super Smash Bros. Melee continues to be one of the most popular games in the platform fighting franchise, particularly in the modding community. One modder, Mooshies, decided to add one of gaming's newest icons to the battle: Jimbo from Balatro.</p><p dir="ltr">The jolly jester's Smash Bros. Melee variant is a reskin of Mr. Game and Watch, with all of the movements and attacks of Mr. G+W intact. However, Mooshies's mod replaces all of the original character's weapons and sound effects with cards, images, and sounds from the 2024 smash hit roguelike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QjT-WGHvoM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9QjT-WGHvoM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Mooshies released a brief gameplay trailer showing Jimbo in action, along with the wild and wacky way he uses the recognizable jokers and card packs from Balatro in matches against Falco, Marth, and more. This was originally released as a paid mod, but Melee players interested in trying Jimbo out can find the mod on <a href="http://patreon.com/Mooshies" rel="nofollow ">Mooshies's Patreon page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Super Smash Bros. community has been bereft of new content across the entire series since Super Smash Bros. Ultimate's final update in 2021, which saw Sora from Kingdom Hearts join the roster as the final downloadable fighter in SSBU's Fighter Pack 2. Other downloadable fighters added to Smash Bros. Ultimate as DLC include Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII, Steve and Alex from Minecraft, and Kazuya from Tekken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Super Smash Bros. may be dormant, its creator, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">Masahiro Sakurai</a>, has been keeping busy. His next project, Kirby Air Riders, launches November 20 on Nintendo Switch 2, and it was the focus of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-16-things-we-just-learned-about-the-switch-2-racing-game/2900-6889/">45-minute Nintendo Direct</a> earlier this month.</p>
