                <p dir="ltr">Just a couple of days away from launch, preloading is now available for Infinity Nikki on PS5, Epic Games Store, and mobile platforms. Developer Infold Games has also announced new rewards for players when they start their adventure in the open-world fashion title, such as a special stylist background and two four-star outfits.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition, a new release trailer--seen below--sets up the plot for the stylist's adventure in Infinity Nikki. Apparently, wishes used to flourish in Miraland, but after a thousand years, they now just lead to despair. Nikki has the ability to heal the world, along with her cute companion, Momo.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUFYjUv72Yk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BUFYjUv72Yk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Infold revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/infinity-nikki-from-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-designer-comes-out-next-month/1100-6527763/" data-ref-id="1100-6527763">Infinity Nikki would come out on December 5</a>. The game's sub-director is <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Kentaro_Tominaga" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kentaro Tominaga</a>, who previously worked on The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Kart Wii. The staff also includes veterans who contributed to The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Alice: Madness Returns.</p><p dir="ltr">Infold is promising that Infinity Nikki will offer styling contests, fishing, wine-cellar minecarts, and ghost trains. We've previously seen bug-hunting and on-the-fly outfit changes in videos, as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/to-infinity-nikki-and-beyond-game-is-looking-wildly-popular-ahead-of-release/1100-6526056/" data-ref-id="1100-6526056">Infinity Nikki looks wildly popular before releasing</a> later this week. Infold notes the open-world title has over 30 million pre-registrations. For those unfamiliar, Nikki has starred in popular mobile games previously, like Love Nikki and Shining Nikki.

                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040">Fallout 76</a> dataminers discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-leak-reveals-game-is-probably-getting-a-highly-requested-feature/1100-6524749/" data-ref-id="1100-6524749">camp pets were on the way to the game</a>. Now, as part of the Gleaming Depths update going live today, pets are indeed arriving in the form of a Bombay Cat and a white German Shepherd. And while players can't keep more than one C.A.M.P. pet at a time, they can pet their adorable feline or canine companions.</p><p>The new update is Fallout 76's biggest expansion to date, and also kicks off Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This season is focused on the Enclave, a former "deep-state faction of the United States government" that is now controlled by M.O.D.U.S., an AI supercomputer. M.O.D.U.S. and its followers plan to use science to revitalize the country no matter how many experiments they have to run along the way.</p><p>The arrival of these mad scientists comes with some mad-science weapons including a Tesla Cannon, as well as the Enclave Lab Coat and a M.O.D.U.S. Terminal Vending Machine that can be set up in the player's camp. Some of the other available items include an Enclave Grill Cooking Station and Enclave Hazmat Paint. Players will also be able to use a Plasma Core Recharger instead of buying new plasma cores every time they run out.</p><p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and Bethesda teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">players will be able to control a Ghoul in 2025</a>. That feature isn't included with the new update, but it's something that's on the update calendar for March 2025 with the start of Season 20. The rest of the details about the Gleaming Depths update are below.</p><h2>MUTATED PUBLIC EVENTS UPDATE</h2><p>We have added five public events to the Mutated Public Events playlist.

Deflect grants a chance to reflect 100% of the damage of ranged attacks back to the attacker and reduces the damage you take from the attack by 50%. Deflect chance receives a bonus while wearing Heavy Armor or Power Armor (+50% multiplier). While in Power Armor, the amount of damage reflected is doubled (200%).</li></ul></li><li>Serendipity  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 1</li><li>New effect: Now increases Evade Chance while under 30% life, based on Luck. Evade provides a chance to avoid all incoming damage from direct attacks. Evade can happen once every second and the cooldown is now increased by armor. Please note, Evade cannot happen when over encumbered or while in Power Armor.  <ul><li>Armor increases Evade cooldown at the following rates:</li><li>Light Armor: +0.1 second per piece</li><li>Medium Armor: +0.2 seconds per piece</li><li>Heavy Armor: +0.4 seconds per piece</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Starched Genes  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 2 to 1</li><li>Moved from Luck to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now provides the benefits of the former Rank 2</li></ul></li><li>Thru-Hiker  <ul><li>Ranks reduced from 3 to 2</li><li>Moved from Agility to Endurance</li><li>Rank 1 now offers 45% weight reduction</li><li>Rank 2 now offers 90% weight reduction</li></ul></li></ul><h2>ADJUSTMENTS TO EXPLOSION VFX</h2><p>We’ve reduced the radius in which screen flash effects appear for a multitude of explosions throughout the game. This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage is dealt.A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions). Please be sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen flashing, if there’s any additional explosions that we should adjust, or if some explosions no-longer feel impactful and satisfying to use.</p><h2>PLAYER WEAPONS</h2><ul><li>Artillery Piece (Workshop)</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher / M79</li><li>Baseball Grenade</li><li>Broadsider</li><li>Bug Grenade</li><li>Cryo Arrow</li><li>Cryo Grenade</li><li>Cryo Mine</li><li>Explosions (all types) from weapons using the Explosive legendary mod</li><li>Fatman</li><li>Fatman MIRV (from individual projectiles)</li><li>Flaming Arrow</li><li>Floater Flamer Grenade</li><li>Floater Freezer Grenade</li><li>Frag Grenade</li><li>Grand Finale (Broadsider)</li><li>Hack and Slash (Legendary Perk)</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Cryo Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Napalm Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Plasma Payload</li><li>Missile Launcher</li><li>Missile Turret</li><li>Orbital Strike Beacon</li><li>Plasma Grenade</li><li>Pulse Grenade</li><li>Troglocide</li></ul><h2>NPC WEAPONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h2><p>NPCs’ use of player weapons listed above will also be affected.</p><ul><li>Exploding Cars &amp; other Civilian Vehicles</li><li>Explosive Rounds from Turrets</li><li>Floater Freezer Death</li><li>Fusion Core Meltdown (Robots)</li><li>Gas Canisters</li><li>Invaders from Beyond UFO Missile Strikes</li><li>Mole Rat Landminer</li><li>Robot Death Explosion</li><li>Scorched Exterminator Plasma Launcher</li><li>Super Mutant Suicider Mini-Nuke</li><li>Turret Death Explosion</li><li>Various destructible objects such as machinery in Grafton Steel and The Foundry (The Pitt)</li><li>Vertibird Death Explosion</li><li>Vertibot Death Explosion</li></ul><h2>COMBAT BALANCE</h2><p>The notes you see below are a continuation of the combat rebalancing work that we began during the Skyline Valley patch. This is an ongoing process we will continue to do combat rebalancing work into next year.</p><ul><li>The cooldown of evade effects now scales based on how much damage was avoided</li><li>The durability of armor has been increased</li><li>Slightly increased the chance to learn to craft weapon mods via scrapping</li><li>Slightly increased the amount of Steel and Ballistic fiber that weapon-using enemies can drop</li><li>Balance adjustments for Communist and Liberators</li><li>Added additional information about Damage Types and Damage over Time effects to the Help menu</li><li>Reduced the damage of the Auto Axe: 31 --&gt; 24</li><li>Adjusted the damage of the V63 Zweihaender: 85/45 --&gt; 64/64</li></ul><h2>ARMOR</h2><ul><li>Brotherhood Recon and Secret Service are now classified as Heavy Armor</li><li>Civil Engineer, Arctic Marine, Marine Armor, and Trapper Armors are now classified as Medium Armor</li><li>Covert Scout Armor, Solar Armor, Thorn Armor, Urban Scout Armor, Forest Scout Armor, and Wood Armors are now classified as Light Armor</li><li>Botsmith armor is now classified as Heavy Armor</li></ul><h2>WEAPONS</h2><p>We have made changes to Damage and AP Costs for many weapons which primarily focuses on improving cases where weapons don’t perform well enough to meet players’ expectations.</p><h2>DAMAGE BUFFS</h2><p>These values represent the weapon at its maximum level (45 or 50, depending on the weapon). Lower-level values have similar increases in damage.

This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</p><h2>HUMAN(ISH) CREATURE &amp; WEAPON BALANCE</h2><p>Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to account for this change (see notes below).When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon alongside some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that players can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons. Increases have also been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world, so now you will also have more components at your disposal.We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to account for the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance to learn Legendary weapon mods.</p><ul><li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants):  <ul><li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures whose attacks already could scale to level 100.</li></ul></li><li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player grenades is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases, at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.</li></ul></li><li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li></ul></li><li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li><li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.  <ul><li>Dev Note: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li></ul></li><li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>CREATURE BALANCE</h2><p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates:</p><ul><li>Floater Freezer  <ul><li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core damage).</li></ul></li><li>Floater Flamer  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li></ul></li><li>Floater gnasher  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li></ul></li><li>Alien Invader  <ul><li>Reduced health</li><li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li></ul></li><li>Lesser Devil  <ul><li>Increased damage.</li></ul></li><li>Bloodbug  <ul><li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li></ul></li><li>Thrasher  <ul><li>Increased melee attack damage especially at higher levels.</li><li>Decreased Sonic Gobble attack damage at lower levels.</li><li>Now weakest to fire damage and resistant to radiation, energy, and poison damage</li></ul></li><li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</li><li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced. In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough damage to kill the creature.</li><li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret has lost most of its health.</li></ul><h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2><p>When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu that includes the new settings you see below. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of these settings in the future, go to Settings &gt; Accessibility.Speech-to-Text</p><ul><li>Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all voice communication from other players in the area.</li><li>Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last message has been received.</li><li>Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window.</li></ul><p>Screen Narration</p><ul><li>When the setting is ON, you’ll hear the audible description of emotes from other players in the area. For example: “[Player] wants to team up!”</li></ul><p>UI Navigation</p><ul><li>Digital Input  <ul><li>Several screens relied completely on analog stick input and that has been addressed to allow keyboard control on PCs and d-pad control on consoles. This includes the Challenges, Scoreboard, Map, and Character Creation screens.</li></ul></li><li>Analog Input  <ul><li>Several screens didn’t support analog inputs to navigate the UI, so that analog functionality has been added to the Favorites Wheel and Social Panel.</li></ul></li><li>Single Key Presses  <ul><li>Fast Travel Countdown Cancel – Now allows a single button command to cancel the fast travel instead of clicking both the left and right analog sticks.</li><li>Social Menu – Allows a single button command to enter the Social Menu instead of having to hold CTRL-TAB on PC.</li></ul></li></ul>
