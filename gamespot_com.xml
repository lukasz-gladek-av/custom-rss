                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wwe-2k25/" data-ref-id="5000-656808">WWE 2K25</a> is on the way, and tonight during WWE Raw on Netflix, the official cover star was revealed. If you've followed the teases, you may have already figured it out, but now it's official: Roman Reigns will be featured on the cover of WWE 2K25.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns had one of the biggest years of his career in 2024. After 1,316 days as WWE Champion, he finally dropped the title to Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 40. For months, he was off-screen, as his cousin Solo Sikoa had disowned him post-defeat from their familial faction, The Bloodline, and claimed the role of leader for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Reigns returned at SummerSlam to reclaim his spot as the "Tribal Chief" to a chorus of massive cheers from the crowd. Turning face but still keeping a harder edge to his character than Rhodes' purer Face That Runs The Place role, Reigns has re-emerged as the fan-favorite good guy the company once spent years failing to create.</p><p dir="ltr">For now, the cover star news is all we have to go on regarding WWE 2K25, but stick around, as we expect to share more soon on this year's wrestling sim. If the WWE 2K24 schedule is any sort of indication, we can expect to see this year's game launch a few weeks ahead of WrestleMania, which would slot it into a March launch some time.</p><p dir="ltr">In my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k24-review-long-term-booking/1900-6418191/">WWE 2K24 review</a>, I wrote, "As both WWE and the wider format of pro wrestling live through a new golden age, it's fortuitous timing for fans that this year's game is so great. While the MTX-heavy mode feels tacked on like a publisher mandate, there are thankfully several other modes that each feel like they deserve to be played for many months ahead, making them the true centerpieces of your personal WWE universe."</p>

Whether it's cloud [gaming], whether it's on PC, whether it's on handheld, whether it's on phones... I want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just on PlayStation. We love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's what we're going to continue to do, we'll just continue to do more of it because what we learn is, 'Put the games first, make sure the games can be as great as they can.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer said he wants players to choose the hardware that's right for them, and while he'd ultimately like to see that hardware be Microsoft-made, getting Microsoft's games in front of a wider audience is ultimately the more important goal. Spencer said that part of the reason for this is simply the level of success reached by games that are available on multiple platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">"I always applaud the moves that [Nintendo] makes," he declared, adding that he's "really looking forward to supporting [Nintendo] with the games that we have [at Xbox]." Spencer even said he personally congratulated Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa on the announcement of the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just think they're such an important part of this industry," Spencer said of the Japanese gaming giant. "Who would ever bet against the success of that team? I mean they are just masterful in what they do--Switch is a massive success--and I think Switch 2 will be as well."</p><p dir="ltr">"More and more, that's an important thing [as a player], that my save game travels to whatever screen I want to play on, that my community's always there, and I just think that should be an expectation for all of us: That the games we invest in are able to be played on any screen that we want to play them on."</p><p dir="ltr">"We love the experience on our own hardware, our own platform," Spencer said. "But our games will show up in more and more places, no doubt."</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft is currently working on its own handheld gaming platform, but it's reportedly still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">a few years away</a> from release. The publisher has already made several of its games available for the Switch, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">rumored that Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming</a> to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer also discussed other topics, like the lessons Microsoft learned from the launch of the Xbox 360, his favorite game of 2024 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>), and handling player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's how I learn, it's how I stay balanced," Spencer said regarding the way he deals with critical feedback from Xbox users. "Getting out of my bubble of the people I see every day I think is critical."</p><p>The 26-minute interview can be watched in full on GamerTag Radio host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o">Danny Peña's YouTube channel</a>.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Series S has faced its share of criticism, but Microsoft isn't pivoting away from the console. In fact, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes the Series S is part of what helps differentiate Microsoft in the market. The apparent clause at Microsoft that mandates developers support both Series X and Series S for games coming to the platform is not going to change, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/savestateplus/home?newFreeMembership=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer said Microsoft has a "real advantage" right now thanks to the Series S because some of the most popular new platforms, including Steam Deck and ROG Ally, are more in line with the power and performance specs of the Series S.</p><p>"When we look at something like a Steam Deck or a ROG Ally, we've got this Xbox Series S version of the game that's more tailored to the device specs of a lot of devices that are getting introduced right now. I think that helps us," he said, going on to specifically mention the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KK8xil5Uy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-KK8xil5Uy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For what it's worth, Spencer separately told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerTag Radio</a> that he's been in contact with Nintendo's president and plans to put Xbox games on Switch 2.</p><p>Asked directly if Microsoft could remove or amend the apparent "parity clause" between Xbox Series X and S, Spencer said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-spencer-says-series-s-compatibility-requirement-isnt-going-anywhere/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), "In a way, I think about it almost exactly the opposite way right now."</p><p>There has been ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the challenges that getting games to run on the lower-powered system present.</p><p>In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox.</a> Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a> Concerns exist about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> might run on the Series S, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">Take-Two isn't worried</a>. More recently, the developers of Black Myth: Wukong said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">Xbox port delay is due to the Series S.</a></p><p>In regards to sales volume, the Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Spencer said in the interview that he believes the Series S is an important part of Microsoft's hardware offerings, saying it's no slouch and can handle new games capably.</p><p>"The scalability of engines today allows [games] to scale from ray trace-enabled, multi-thousand dollar graphics on desktop PCs all the way through to a handheld, battery-powered device. So for me, Xbox Series S has been helpful in our portfolio," he said. "I'm playing Indiana Jones on the S and it looks great. It's definitely capable of playing current-generation games in a great way."</p><p>The Xbox Series S has been important for Microsoft and will continue to be an "important design point" for Microsoft's teams going forward, Spencer said.</p><p>Also during his chat, Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">discussed the possibility of Starfield coming to PS5</a>, while in a separate interview he talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028">Microsoft's desire to "win" in the hardware market.</a></p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Larian Studios announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> will be receiving one last major update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-more/1100-6528863/" data-ref-id="1100-6528863">Patch 8</a>. And while select Baldur's Gate 3 players will be invited to a stress test for Patch 8, the update has been mistakenly released for some PlayStation 5 players ahead of the scheduled time. Larian confirmed the mistake in a post on social media.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn’t yet begun.<br>Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8.<br>While we work with our partners to understand what’s going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7.<br>How’s your Monday going?</p>  — Larian Studios (@larianstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/larianstudios/status/1883903199687631144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Larian subsequently shared <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a longer update about the situation</a>, which acknowledged that Patch 8 was mistakenly available for a few hours to PlayStation 5 players in Europe and Asia. The studio also warned that Patch 8 is not compatible with Patch 7, and urged players to uninstall and reinstall the game to return to the previous patch. Players who don't revert to Patch 7 may risk losing their saves.</p><p>Additionally, Larian indicated that receiving the Patch 8 by itself was not intended as an invitation to the stress test. Players who were selected to take part in that should receive a separate email--if they haven't gotten one already--and the Patch 8 stress test will go on as scheduled later this week.</p><p>Patch 8 will introduce cross-play between all consoles, PC, as well as a Photo Mode, in-game bug fixes, and mod improvements. Larian is currently developing a new project, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.
