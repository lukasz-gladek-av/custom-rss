                <p>A two-player mode is making its debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> next week, allowing duos to run together without seeking a third player.</p><p>From Software has announced that a duos mode will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign on July 30 alongside update 1.02, which is aimed at providing a variety of other quality-of-life improvements. Full patch notes haven't been revealed yet.</p><p>The highly requested feature will be a game-changer for some folks looking to tackle the challenges in Limveld. When Elden Ring Nightreign first launched, players were forced to enter matches solo or in a group of three, the latter of which forced duo partners to team up with a random third player or seek out an additional person to join up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/" data-ref-id="1100-6531963">A mod</a> released just weeks after Elden Ring: Nightreign launched allowed PC players to run duos, but players on other platforms remained out of luck. So, it's great news that everyone will finally be able to run matches with a team size of their choosing.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign director, Junya Ishizaki, initially told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> the game's focus on three-player matches "was largely a game-balancing decision, rather than a game-design decision." Later, he admitted in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">separate interview</a> that a two-player mode was "simply something that was overlooked during development" before stating the team was looking into it.</p><p>This new addition couldn't come at a better time, either, as Elden Ring Nightreign recently crossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">5 million units shipped</a>. This comes along with news that the original Elden Ring has sold over 30 million copies alone, making the franchise From Software's most commercially successful ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MindsEye GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The post begins as follows:</p><p>"Dear community, it’s been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we’re grateful for your support and detailed feedback. Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game.</p><p>In June, we committed to delivering a great experience for all players. Since then, we’ve released three updates, each addressing bug fixes and performance improvements across all devices, driven by your reports and suggestions. We hope you’re starting to see the impact of these changes, and we’re committed to building on this progress. Moving forward, updates may be less frequent, but with the aim for each to bring more meaningful changes."</p><p>The rest of the post vaguely outlines the next few months of fixes. First though, Build A Rocket Boy issued a delay to its Hitman crossover, which was originally intended to land in July. The team didn't provide a firm date, or even commit to a window--just saying that it has been pushed back and that it looks forward to "delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right."</p><p>Looking forward, August will bring MindsEye's fourth significant performance update to both PC and consoles. This patch will also bring features requested by the community, including skippable cutscenes and instant access to user-generated content on PC.</p><p>In September, MindsEye is set to receive another major update across all systems, once again bolstering performance and providing vaguely worded "gameplay improvements, alongside a number of enhancements to core gameplay mechanics."</p><p>Beyond that, MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy's future remains uncertain. The studio was almost immediately rocked by news of layoffs following the game's turbulent June launch, when it was plagued by technical bugs and visual glitches that inspired a lot of frustration and mockery online. GameSpot's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> called it a "stringent and relentlessly dull video game," awarding the game a 3/10 while somehow avoiding most of its technical blemishes.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>

                <p>Have you been waiting to hear any news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> recently? Well, you might be in luck because the upcoming game has recently been given an age rating, suggesting that it may be getting a release date pretty soon.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, a listing for Metroid Prime 4 has gone up on South Korea's <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">classification board</a> where it is currently rated for "ages 12 and up" due to mild violence. The content of the listing itself doesn't reveal much else about the content of the game, but the filing does suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is indeed closing in on the finish line and could still stand to release later this year, where it's being pegged as a holiday release at the moment.</p><p>Additionally, VGC reports that the listing comes around the same time that it's been hearing of an imminent Nintendo Direct, where it is believed that a formal release date will finally be provided.</p><p>It's been a long road for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced at E3 in 2017, the game has changed developers and undergone at least one reboot before being re-announced with the subtitle Beyond back in 2024. Since then, there's been a steady drip of information, including the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">first hands-on previews</a> earlier this year, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-out-now-poster-spotted-in-london/1100-6532578/" data-ref-id="1100-6532578">bizarre advertisement</a> in the London Underground that falsely claimed the game was "out now."</p><p>Now, Metroid Prime 4 seems likely to launch by the end of 2025 on both the Nintendo Switch, which it was first announced for, and its successor, the Switch 2.</p>

                <p>This week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> brings Marvel's first family of superheroes back to the big screen after a decade away. While the FF doesn't currently have a video game of their own, they are prominently featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>. And in the video below, the entire cast takes turns playing their respective characters in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h45Sr1kafGU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube host Loserfruit put this gathering together when the cast was in Australia to promote First Steps. It seems safe to say that none of the FF cast are avid gamers, and Pedro Pascal noted that he never went past the original Nintendo console. But they all took their turns, starting with Ebon Moss-Bachrach playing the Thing, followed by Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Invisible Woman, and Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch.</p><p>The cast had very amusing reactions to some of the alternate FF costumes, including the wedding attire for the team. They were also stunned by Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which Kirby jokingly suggested would be in the First Steps sequel. But if the cast thought that was shocking, someone should film their reactions when they see the actual Malice costume from the '80s.</p><p>At one point in the video, Kirby thought her character was naked while she was invisible. But that was just the application of the Invisible Woman's power. The entire cast looked like they were having fun mashing the buttons and embracing their characters' abilities. But they're far from ready for competitive Marvel Rivals matches.</p><p>Marvel Rivals recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">added Phoenix to the game</a>, with Blade to follow soon. The Fantastic Four <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-pitting-the-fantastic-four-against-dracula/1100-6528646/" data-ref-id="1100-6528646">were already added to the game</a> earlier this year. NetEase has also hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-new-character-arrivals-wont-rely-on-mcu-release-schedules/1100-6533078/" data-ref-id="1100-6533078">more MCU tie-ins</a> may be coming to the game in the future. However, the dev noted that the game's storyline will always come first over any MCU content.</p>
