                <p>Earlier this year, Krafton released the life-sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/inzoi-early-access-review-pretty-vacant/1900-6418345/" data-ref-id="1900-6418345">InZoi</a> in early access with the promise of free DLC throughout the year. Now, details about the second DLC have been revealed, and it's coming later this month alongside InZoi's debut on Mac.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3uoD3q-qOVI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3uoD3q-qOVI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new DLC is called Island Getaway, and it was inspired by the tropical locations in Southeast Asia. It will include a new map called Cahava, which features both a primary island and a separate island dedicated to a vacation resort. Players can give their Zois new outfits and hairstyles to fit their environment, and let them go swimming, boating, and snorkeling.</p><p>This update will also include enhanced character interactions, including random gatherings, thought bubbles, and the ability for players to perform cooperative actions. Other new features being added across all maps include farming, mining, gem crafting, and fishing. Players will also be able to ride motorcycles and electric scooters. Over 90 new music tracks will also be added to the game, alongside other quality of life improvements.</p><p>Island Getaway and inZOI's Mac debut are both set to launch on August 20, through the Mac App Store and Steam. Krafton will show off both the PC and Mac versions of inZOI at Gamescom from August 20 to 24. However, fans who want a sneak peek at the new DLC will be able to catch a livestream on Twitch or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayinZOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the official inZOI YouTube channel</a> on August 14 at 6 PM PT.</p>

                <p>Thirteen years after it first appeared in The Sims 3, singer Katy Perry surprised fans when she reprised her hit song "Last Friday Night" at a concert this week--and sang in Simlish, the nonsense language of Sims characters.</p><p>On X, TheWitnessedBoy shared a clip from a TikTok user of Perry from a recent concert (via<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-simlish-sims-3-concert-last-friday-night-video-2000616677" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kotaku</a>), in which the singer accepted a fan's request to sing Last Friday Night in Simlish. Rather than sing the entire song in Simlish, Perry opted to start with the chorus. </p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry‚Äôs tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p>  ‚Äî Fadi ¬π‚Å¥¬≥ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Perry was a prominent promotional partner of Electronic Arts in marketing The Sims 3 in 2012, with the game's Showtime expansion pack even having a Katy Perry Collector's Edition. That version of the expansion featured the Simlish take on "Last Friday Night," which the singer performed for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyW6AJ-yIk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="7">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?start=7" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Perry isn't the only music artist who has reinterpreted their work into a Simlish song. FKA Twigs recently did the same thing for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-sims-4-review/1900-6415867/" data-ref-id="1900-6415867">The Sims 4</a> expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-sims-4-enchanted-by-nature-tips-and-things-to-know/2900-6774/" data-ref-id="2900-6774">Enchanted by Nature</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4OXLEuJpCw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/v4OXLEuJpCw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Later this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-board-game-preorders/1100-6533813/" data-ref-id="1100-6533813">The Sims is going to get an official board game</a>. But don't hold your breath for The Sims 5. EA recently stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-its-sold-too-much-sims-4-dlc-to-make-the-sims-5/1100-6533647/" data-ref-id="1100-6533647">it has sold too much Sims 4 DLC to make The Sims 5</a>. Instead, EA intends to keep expanding the greater Sims ecosystem with new projects including Project Rene.</p>
