                <p>Earlier this summer, a battle between gaming giants began when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent</a>, alleging that the latter's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencents-new-game-bears-a-shocking-resemblance-to-horizon-zero-dawn/1100-6528178/" data-ref-id="1100-6528178">Light of Motiram</a>, is infringing on Sony's Horizon franchise. Now, Tencent appears to have revamped its presentation of Light of Motiram and downplayed its similarities to Sony's game.</p><p>Tencent has changed several elements on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Light of Motiram's Steam page</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>), including a new description for the game that drops all references to the mechanimals creatures in the story, which looked and sounded a lot like the ones from Horizon. The new description doesn't have many specific details at all, and instead tells players, "Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land."</p><p>The screenshots for Light of Motiram have also been swapped out on Steam and replaced with new pics that still retain some common elements with Horizon. But the screenshots that had a color palette and backgrounds similar to Horizon have been removed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546448"></a><figcaption>Archery is still a big part of Light of Motiram.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4546448-lightofmotiram.jpg"></figure><p>As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-pitched-sony-on-a-horizon-game-set-in-asia/1100-6533509/" data-ref-id="1100-6533509">detailed in Sony's lawsuit</a>, Tencent pitched a Horizon spin-off that would have featured the game's heroine, Aloy, traveling to Asia and encountering new mechanimals inspired by Eastern mythology as well as a brand-new cast of characters. Sony rejected the pitch and alleges that Tencent and developer Polaris Quest went ahead with the game regardless of the company's wishes.</p><p>Light of Motiram's Steam page gives the game a Q4 2027 release window. However, if Sony's lawsuit is successful, the game's release may be in question.</p>

                <p>The fantasy shooters Heretic and Hexen have been remastered and re-released for modern platforms, allowing longtime fans and new players to experience these cult classics all over again. Originally developed by Raven Software and released in 1994 and 1995, the games stood out for combining fast-paced first-person shooter gameplay with dark-fantasy settings and RPG mechanics--a big departure from the sci-fi and military themes popular at the time.</p><p>The remastered collection, Heretic + Hexen, is now available on Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. This definitive edition includes new features such as two brand-new episodes, support for community-made mods, and both local and online multiplayer. Players can team up in co-op or compete in deathmatch modes, with up to 16 players supported in online play and split-screen options on all platforms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnzow2f3Rt4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jnzow2f3Rt4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Heretic featured a long protagonist--the elven warrior Corvus--Hexen introduced a class-based system, giving players a choice between three characters: the strong and fast Fighter (Baratus), the spell-casting but fragile Mage (Daedolon), and the balanced Cleric (Parias). Each has unique weapons, abilities, and ways to use items, adding some level of replayability and variety of gameplay style. This feature, along with the game's fantasy setting, helped set Hexen apart in the early days of first-person shooters.</p><p>One of the biggest improvements is full cross-platform multiplayer, allowing players across different systems to join games quickly using a room code. The remaster also includes access to the Raven Vault, a collection of behind-the-scenes materials from the original development. For music fans, there's the option to switch between the original MIDI and FM Synth soundtracks or enjoy a modern remix by composer Andrew Hulshult.</p><p>If you already own the original versions of Heretic or Hexen, you'll be able to access and download them on the same platform. Players who already own the original versions of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, andâ€¯Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel receive a free upgrade to Heretic + Hexen in their respective game library on the same platforms.</p><p>Steam and GOG versions include these originals as launch options or downloads. The remaster only requires a Bethesda account to access online multiplayer and browse or upload mods, depending on your platform.</p>

Konami won't be finished with MGS Delta when it launches, however, as today the company announced Fox Hunt--a "hide-and-seek based" multiplayer mode, will be added to the game this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the official <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/" rel="nofollow ">Metal Gear Solid Delta website</a>, Fox Hunt is based on the Sneaking Mission game modes of past Metal Gear Online offerings, where one player is tasked with infiltrating an area while other players try to find and neutralize the sneaking player.

Monkey and Snake Vs. Bomberman, which will appear on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, respectively. Snake Vs. Monkey recreates the Ape Escape-themed monkey-finding missions from the original Metal Gear Solid 3 releases, while Snake Vs.

                <p>Things have been rough for Xbox Game Studios lately, with numerous layoffs and the cancellation of several games.

"We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>The studio says that it has <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours" rel="nofollow ">several events planned for Forza Motorsport</a> throughout August and September, starting with the return of Track Toys Tour as a permanent feature in the game. At the start of each month, an additional Tour will be added to the game until all of these have returned.</p><p>Layoffs at Turn 10 come at a time when the Forza franchise is experiencing positive growth on PS5. Since Microsoft shifted to a multiplatform strategy for its first-party games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-biggest-game-of-2025-is-a-former-xbox-exclusive-analyst-says/1100-6533368/">Forza Horizon 5 and several other former Xbox exclusives</a> have been some of the best-selling games on PS5. Forza Motorsport hasn't been ported to the console yet, but it could only be a matter of time until it does, given the success of other Xbox games on the Sony platform.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Microsoft reported a net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">for its latest quarter</a>, and a few months later, statements issued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-defends-xbox-studio-closures-layoffs-i-have-to-run-a-sustainable-business/1100-6524121/">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> about the staff cuts weren't well-received. </p>
