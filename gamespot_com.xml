                <p>One of Valve's most popular games, 1998's Half-Life, could have been the one and only game the company ever released, until a deal was struck that changed the company's fate forever. Monica Harrington, Valve's first chief marketing officer, said at the Game Developers Conference that publisher Sierra had the option for two more games, and after the first Half-Life became a gigantic success, Valve attempted to renegotiate with Sierra.</p><p>The terms of the deal, Harrington said, was that Valve would fund all but $1 million of the development costs of Half-Life's sequels, with Sierra retaining IP rights and giving Valve back 15% of revenue. "It felt insane," Harrington said, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/valve-would-never-ship-another-game-former-exec-forced-half-life-publishers-hand-by-saying-gabe-newell-and-the-team-would-pivot-away-from-game-dev/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>.</p><p>Harrington said that if she and her husband Mike Harrington were to make real money out of being co-owners of Valve at the time, she knew Valve's prospects had to be "much, much brighter," and that included renegotiating with Sierra.</p><p>After getting the OK from Valve co-founder Gabe Newell, Harrington worked with Valve's attorney to hammer out a strategy for getting Half-Life's IP rights back, for the original Half-Life and all future titles. But how?</p><p>Harrington said she pushed for Valve and Sierra to strike a deal with the threat that Valve would abandon making games altogether if Sierra didn't come to the table. "Valve would never ship another game," Harrington recalled of the bargaining tactic.</p><p>"It wasn't an idle threat--we weren't going to take on all of the risk to make other people rich," Harrington said. "Besides, I knew Gabe had interesting ideas that had nothing to do with games."</p><p>One of those ideas was for Valve to create an <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"online entertainment platform" with Amazon</a>, but this fell through. In the end, Valve won back control of the Half-Life series from Sierra. Valve went to release Half-Life 2 in 2004 and later the VR title Half-Life: Alyx in 2020--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-of-the-year-2020-half-life-alyx/1100-6485617/" data-ref-id="1100-6485617">that game won GameSpot's Game of the Year</a>. Valve's massively popular Counter-Strike series also traces its roots back to Half-Life, originating as a mod for that game.</p><p>Valve is much more than a game developer today, as it owns and operates the massively popular PC game store Steam. Companies have attempted to buy Valve over the years, but the company remains independent. Newell, for his part, has become a billionaire and now <a href="https://luxurylaunches.com/transport/gabe-newell-luxury-yachts.php" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">owns a half-dozen yachts that are valued at over $1 billion.</a></p><p>One criticism of Valve today is that the company no longer releases many games, instead focusing more on Steam and hardware with its Steam Deck. It does have more games in the works, though, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-finally-acknowledges-deadlock-a-new-game-people-have-been-playing-for-months/1100-6526115/" data-ref-id="1100-6526115">including a 6v6 MOBA called Deadlock.</a> There is still no word on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/half-life-3/">Half-Life 3</a>, however.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is finally here, and players are just beginning to explore <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">the game's wide and wonderful open world</a>. Though that world includes many delightful little details that add a touch of realism to the game, it also includes a feature not commonly seen in open-world RPGs: snow that actually melts.</p><p dir="ltr">Most games featuring significant amounts of snow don't do much with it beyond allowing player-characters to leave footprints in the fresh, powdery precipitation. But Assassin's Creed Shadows take things a step further, with snow that actually responds to the in-game world's weather patterns.</p><p>Players can encounter snowstorms and other types of weather patterns in Assassin's Creed Shadows. But one eagle-eyed player noticed that not only does the snow melt, it melts slowly--after the sun has come out--rather than doing so instantly.</p><p dir="ltr">The player shared their findings on Twitter (formally known as X), uploading a video of Assassin's Creed Shadows co-protagonist Naoe sitting on her horse right after a snowstorm. As the sun begins peeking between the clouds, the snow on the ground begins to disappear. But it's not an instant transition--the footage is sped up significantly, as the snow slowly melts in a realistic manner.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever you think of Ubisoft's latest time-traveling parkour adventure--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">GameSpot enjoyed it</a>--it's hard to argue that the game's beautiful vistas and detailed environments are anything short of stunning.</p><p>For more information on the latest entry in the Assassin's Creed franchise, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/guides/">Assassin's Creed Shadows guides hub</a>, where you can learn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-increase-health-in-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530218/">how to raise your HP</a>, how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-resources-hideout-upgrade/1100-6530217/">get more resources to upgrade your hideout</a>, and--perhaps most importantly--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-more-mon-or-money-in-assassins-creed-shadows/1100-6530216/">how to increase your income</a>.</p>

Whereas most games that release in early access could potentially be there for months or years, Netmarble says in the game's FAQ it expects Game of Thrones: Kingsroad to be in early access for a "minimum of four weeks," after which it will be free-to-play.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hC-eVMvcRBQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hC-eVMvcRBQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the early access period not all of the game will be available, though players will be able to explore the Northern regions of Westeros, encounter characters like Jon Snow, visit several major cities, complete various side quests, participate in co-op dungeons, and complete 50 chapters of the main storyline. Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's full free-to-play launch will include more regions to explore, additional co-op dungeons, and more. Netmarble states more regions and challenges will be added post-launch.</p><p dir="ltr">To gain early access, players will need to purchase a Founder's Pack. The cheapest one is $25 and comes with a cosmetic "Northern" outfit, a Jon Snow emoji pack, and 350 of the game's Iron Mark currency. A $50 Founder's Pack nets owners the same plus the game's premium battle pass, additional outfits, horse mounts, a founder's title, and more currencies. A $90 version comes with all of the above plus a Direwolf mount, mount equipment, an upgraded premium battle pass, and even more currency.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463120"></a><figcaption>A breakdown of Game of Thrones: Kingsroad's various Founder's Packs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4463120-250212_%EC%A0%84%EC%B2%B4%ED%91%9C_pc_%EA%B0%80%EA%B2%A9%ED%91%9C%EC%8B%9C.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once Game of Thrones: Kingsroad comes out of Steam early access and additionally launches on mobile, it will feature full cross-play and cross-progression across platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will put players in the shoes of a customizable heir of a minor Northern lord who must navigate the dangerous politics of Westeros in order to restore their house's standing. It offers three different classes (Sellsword, Knight, and Assassin) to choose from, with combat that requires careful dodging and parrying to counter enemy attacks. Players can team up to fight "beasts of myth and legend" in the game's co-op dungeon mode, which will be required in order to earn components needed to make the game's best-quality gear.</p><p dir="ltr">While Netmarble's Game of Thrones title isn't the first third-person action-RPG set in Westeros (that honor goes to Cyanide Studios' 2012 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/game-of-thrones/" data-ref-id="5000-113588">Game of Thrones</a>), it almost certainly won't be the last. In a statement announcing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-wonder-woman-game-canceled-multiple-studios-closed-report/1100-6529706/" data-ref-id="1100-6529706">shutdown of Monolith and two other studios last month</a>, Warner Bros. Games said it would look to focus on four popular IP for future projects, one of them being Game of Thrones.</p>
