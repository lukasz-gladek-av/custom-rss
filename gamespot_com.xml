                <p>N7 Day, which celebrates the Mass Effect series, is coming up on November 7. It's historically a day when BioWare makes some kind of tease or announcement about the franchise, and with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/next-mass-effect/" data-ref-id="5000-523758">new game in the works</a>, many are wondering what kind of reveal may be on tap.</p><p>In a statement, BioWare attempted to temper expectations. The studio said this N7 Day specifically will be "quieter" due to the launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard less than a week ago. That being said, BioWare teased that it has "a little fun" to share for N7 Day.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We hope everyone is enjoying their time in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DragonAge?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DragonAge</a>: The Veilguard. It’s only a few days until <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/N7Day?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#N7Day</a> and this year will be quieter because of launch. Be sure to check back then for a little fun, though!</p>  — BioWare (@bioware) <a href="https://twitter.com/bioware/status/1853552873138720920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 4, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In 2023, BioWare marked N7 Day by releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-is-teasing-the-next-mass-effect-with-cryptic-videos-for-n7-day/1100-6518975/" data-ref-id="1100-6518975">series of cryptic teasers for the next Mass Effect game</a>, but they didn't amount to much. In 2022, BioWare released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-with-mysterious-concept-art/1100-6508956/" data-ref-id="1100-6508956">cryptic piece of concept art</a>. A year before that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-mass-effect-game-gets-teaser-art-on-n7-day/1100-6497781/" data-ref-id="1100-6497781">another mysterious art piece suggested the Geth will return.</a></p><p>BioWare is not making any expansions for The Veilguard and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-not-getting-expansions-team-shifts-to-next-mass-effect/1100-6527554/" data-ref-id="1100-6527554">turning its attention to the next Mass Effect.</a> Not much is known about the game, but it's been confirmed that the game's executive producer, art director, creative director, and game director are all veterans of the original Mass Effect trilogy.</p><p>The next Mass Effect game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-mass-effect-officially-in-development-with-veteran-team/1100-6484192/" data-ref-id="1100-6484192">announced in 2020</a>, so it's been in development for years.</p><p>The Mass Effect series debuted in 2007 and saw two main sequels, Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. Mass Effect: Andromeda followed in 2017. It wasn't as well-received as the earlier games, with criticism directed at its story, character animations, and quest design.</p><p>After Andromeda, BioWare's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/anthem/" data-ref-id="5000-465528">Anthem</a>, didn't resonate with fans either. The Mass Effect series highlight is generally considered to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mass-effect-2/" data-ref-id="5000-34111">Mass Effect 2</a>, which received a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mass-effect-2-review/1900-6246931/" data-ref-id="1900-6246931">GameSpot's review</a>.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's newly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-new-alarmo-clock-already-has-a-day-one-update/1100-6527097/" data-ref-id="1100-6527097">released Alarmo</a> is only intended to be an expensive digital alarm clock with themes and graphics taken from popular Nintendo Switch titles. But some very talented hackers seem very determined to turn the Alarmo into something that can do other things, too. Now, just under a month since its release, someone has put a playable version of Doom on Alarmo, along with video proof of the accomplishment.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5IOVYvSMAoU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5IOVYvSMAoU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The hacker in question is GaryOderNichts, who previously worked out a way to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendos-alarmo-has-already-been-hacked-to-include-cat-pictures/1100-6527509/" data-ref-id="1100-6527509">put cat pictures on Alarmo</a>. GaryOderNichts also laid out <a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to remove the firmware file from Alarmo</a>, which allows users to get it to accept customized code via a USB. For the new hack, he credited X user <a href="https://twitter.com/_spinda" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spinda</a> for "figuring out the Alarmo SWD pads," before adding that Spinda was also "the first to dump the eMMC contents."</p><p>Although Doom is now playable through the latest hack, there are drawbacks. Alarmo's clock buttons aren't designed to be an easily used game controller, nor is there any sound support from the current Doom hack. Regardless, it's now been proven that the Alarmo can be made to play games, and that could open the floodgates for similar hacks unless Nintendo finds a way to prevent this from happening.</p><p>Alarmo is currently available through Nintendo stores and for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. A wide release of Alarmo won't arrive until some time in 2025.</p>

                <p>Just over a month ago, Konami and developer Bloober Team released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-2-remake-review-born-from-a-wish/1900-6418296/" data-ref-id="1900-6418296">Silent Hill 2</a>, a remake of the classic survival-horror title that debuted in 2001. One of the new touches included by Bloober Team was a series of enigmatic photographs that can be found throughout the remake. Now, a player has come forward with the solution to the photo puzzle, and it's a callback to the history of the game itself.</p><p>Dale Robinson unveiled his findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/comment/lvcy9t2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and he appears to be the first player to figure it out. There are 26 of these photos that can be found within the game, and they all include a short phrase. For example, the first photograph is captioned "So many people here." Robinson examined the photos and realized that the visual clue for the code was the amount of certain objects in each image.</p><p>After identifying and counting those objects, Robinson noted the corresponding letter in each message. When the letters are placed in chronological order, the message to players reads "You've been here for two decades."</p><p>"I thought I was gonna get something cool, but instead the game reminded me that I am an old man now," wrote Robinson on <a href="https://twitter.com/dale_robinson/status/1853167390013493723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1853167390013493723%7Ctwgr%5E9d40cf2f10ad4654695e723f873ce7ce54d81fd3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Ffan-cracks-mysterious-silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-revealing-secret-message-hidden-by-bloober-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>.

                <p>Nintendo has reconfirmed that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">revealed by the end of March 2025</a>, when its current financial year concludes. Company president Shuntaro Furukawa made the announcement during an online press conference on Tuesday following the publication of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earning results</a>, saying that announcement plans for the Switch successor have not changed.</p><p>Analysts are predicting that Nintendo won't make an announcement this year, as doing so could have an impact on sales leading into the 2024 holiday season. "Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult," Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>. "You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394607-switch-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394607" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394607-switch-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394607"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Nintendo's latest earning results.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394607-switch-1.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has lowered its Switch hardware sales forecast down from 13.5 million to 12.5 million for the rest of the fiscal year. "For a platform that is in its eighth year in the market, both hardware and software enjoy stable demand and brisk sales," Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa said (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendos-president-says-no-change-to-switch-2-announce-plan/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>).</p><p>Overall, Nintendo has reported a 34% decrease in net sales, while hardware and software sales have fallen by 31% and 27.6%, respectively. It's worth noting that Nintendo had a strong 2023, as last year the company released The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Illumination's The Super Mario Bros Movie was a blockbuster hit that helped push Nintendo's stock higher.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4394608"></a><figcaption>The Switch continues to cement its legacy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4394608-switch-2.jpg"></figure><p>September's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reuters-world/" data-ref-id="5000-13910">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> sold 2.58 million copies, while other recent releases like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-2004/" data-ref-id="5000-20445">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> sold 1.94 million copies and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/luigis-mansion-2-hd-review/2300-6464477/" data-ref-id="2300-6464477">Luigi's Mansion 2 HD</a> sold 1.57 million units.</p><p>Lifetime sales for Switch hardware--OLED, standard, and Lite models--have now passed 146 million units in total, while Mario Kart 8 Deluxe continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-switch-games-of-all-time/2900-5070/" data-ref-id="2900-5070">Nintendo's best-selling game of all time</a>, as it has reached 64.27 million lifetime sales.</p>
