                <p dir="ltr">Call of Duty players have discovered a match-ending nuke Easter egg on one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>'s multiplayer maps. This is a secret nuke that doesn't require an impressive 25-killstreak to unlock, but it still won't be a cakewalk to pull off. Don't worry about nukes ruining all your matches either, as this Easter egg is seemingly only available in private matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 6's Warhead multiplayer map is designed to be a test site similar to the fan-favorite Nuketown map, but this variant shows the buildings and cars of Nuketown dumped in the Nevada desert and filled with sand. The map also contains a giant warhead that can be used for cover.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, players have discovered that if they dump enough bullets into the warhead, it will explode and end the match. As shown in the video clip shared by "<a href="https://x.com/M3RKMUS1C/status/1865495113377403358" rel="nofollow ">M3RKMUS1C</a>," the warhead takes tons of ammo to detonate. Additionally, detonating the nuke results in a match loss for all players.</p><p dir="ltr">Those loading into a private match to try this out with friends will want to make sure they build a class with enough ammo. Using the Overkill Wildcard should help, and picking weapons with high-ammo counts like light machine guns is also a smart choice.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for the best weapon loadouts to use in Call of Duty, we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/">recommended weapon builds for multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-warzone-best-weapon-loadouts-for-bo6-season-1/2900-5959/">Warzone</a>.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded recently added new multiplayer maps, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-merry-mayhem-all-event-rewards/2900-6018/">Merry Mayhem holiday event</a>, and the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/bo6-zombies-how-to-complete-the-story-easter-egg-for-citadelle-des-morts/2900-6047/">Citadelle des Morts map for Zombies</a>.</p>

                <p>During a recent investor call for Rockstar Games' parent company, Take-Two, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">on track for a Fall 2025 release</a>. A new report suggests that rival gaming publishers are waiting to see if Rockstar possibly delays GTA 6 to 2026.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-09/-gta-6-release-date-will-decide-much-of-the-2025-game-calendar" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, game publishers that have Fall 2025 titles of their own "are waiting as long as possible to commit to their release dates" because most of them don't want to drop their releases anywhere near GTA 6. Regardless, Ubisoft has previously said that it's not afraid of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-does-not-scare-ubisoft-ceo-says/1100-6520931/" data-ref-id="1100-6520931">dropping games in the vicinity of GTA titles</a>, and that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-gta-6s-release-doesnt-scare-ubisoft/1100-6525143/" data-ref-id="1100-6525143">a big release like Grand Theft Auto 6  is good for the industry</a>.</p><p>Rockstar does have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-scheduled-for-2025-but-rockstar-has-a-history-of-delays/1100-6519700/" data-ref-id="1100-6519700">a history of delaying its AAA titles</a> dating back to 2007. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-iv-review/1900-6202100/" data-ref-id="1900-6202100">Grand Theft Auto 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-review/1900-6262899/" data-ref-id="1900-6262899">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/grand-theft-auto-v-review/1900-6414475/" data-ref-id="1900-6414475">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-dead-redemption-2-review-wild-wild-west/1900-6417019/" data-ref-id="1900-6417019">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> all slipped from their originally scheduled release windows. The Bloomberg report notes that GTA 6 "has already missed multiple deadlines" before Rockstar declared it was on schedule for 2025. That doesn't necessarily mean that GTA 6 will miss that release window, but it wouldn't be out of the ordinary if it happens. The report also suggested that "Rockstar is asking its writers to be less crude toward transgender people and other minorities."</p><p>Earlier this year, Take-Two shared its belief that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">it doesn't matter when Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is released. GTA 5 is among the best-selling video games in history with more than 205 million copies sold since its initial release in 2013. Anticipation for the sequel has only grown since the first trailer for GTA 6 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-gta-6-trailer-was-released-one-year-ago-today-and-fans-are-still-waiting-for-anything-more/1100-6528248/" data-ref-id="1100-6528248">debuted just over one year ago</a>. The lengthy delay between GTA 5 and GTA 6 also inspired a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-parody-game-shows-up-on-playstation-store/1100-6528314/" data-ref-id="1100-6528314">recently listed parody game</a>, which may or may not be a real title.</p>
