                <p>When Blizzard announced a Berserk crossover for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-immortal/">Diablo Immortal</a>, the franchise's first-ever external IP collaboration, it was hard not to be excited. The late Kentaro Miura's legendary manga series is a seminal work whose influence can be seen in any game with oversized swords and a penchant for over-the-top violence. The two franchises are both steeped in blood, gore, and demons--practically making them a match made in dark fantasy heaven.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, Diablo 4's Berserk crossover is largely a disappointment, one that doesn't capitalize on the overlap between its two franchises. Far from honoring Berserk, it mostly just feels like a cash grab, an excuse for players to potentially spend well over $100 on cosmetics and nothing more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Full Animated Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-everything-diablo-4-and-immortals-berserk-crossover-entails/1100-6530989/">Diablo 4's Berserk crossover</a>, which is live now until June 3, is broken down into two parts. One is the free set of rewards tied to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-is-getting-a-major-rework-for-season-8/1100-6530937/">Diablo 4's new Reliquary battle pass system</a>. Elite enemies have a chance to drop Behelits, which can then be used to unlock a handful of freebies in the Berserk Reliquary. The rewards include a Brand of Sacrifice death marker and tattoo, as well as a cosmetic backpiece and mount trophy. Unlocking the four rewards then unlocks a free Berserk-themed nameplate. Players will need 400 hundred Behelits to acquire all of the rewards, and while that won't take too long (at max level, players are killing elite enemies by the dozen at any given moment), it does still feel like a grind without any real depth or strategy. It's just busy work.</p><p dir="ltr">The real bulk of the crossover is in the in-game shop. Blizzard is offering four different armor sets, along with a pet bundle, for 2,800 Platinum (Diablo 4's premium currency) each. A mount bundle is also available for 2,500. Even factoring in the "free" bonus Platinum included in the larger bundles on the in-game shop, buying all of the event's cosmetics comes out to over $120.</p><p dir="ltr">That is a whole lot of cash. Pricey cosmetics are nothing new (Blizzard has been selling various cosmetics in Diablo 4 for around the same price since the game's launch), but it feels especially egregious here. All of the items a player would most want, particularly Guts' iconic Berserker armor and Dragon Slayer sword, are locked behind a pricey paywall. Combined with the fact that this is the first season Blizzard is only offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-battle-pass-overhaul-isnt-going-over-well/1100-6531240/">200 Platinum, down from 700, in the Diablo 4 battle pass</a>, and the excitement around this collab has withered faster than Griffith locked in a dungeon.</p><p dir="ltr">It wouldn't be so bad if there was more for players not keen on spending money to do and unlock. The cosmetic armor sets themselves are meticulously detailed and look fantastic--Blizzard's artists have done great work recreating Miura's legendary designs in-game. Skull Knight and the Berserker armor in particular look incredible, though it would have been nice to see Berserk's most prominent heroine, Casca, featured in the cosmetic armor set lineup as well. The real issue here is that with the actual in-game event being practically non-existent and the free rewards being so disappointing, the entire crossover, the first in the franchise's history outside one with Blizzard's own Warcraft universe, just feels like a Dragon Slayer-sized missed opportunity.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490200" data-ratio="0.5626423690205" data-width="1756" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490200"></a><figcaption>All of Diablo 4's Berserk premium cosmetics.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4490200-diablo4berserkpremiumcosmetics.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What's even stranger is one doesn't even have to look far to see what could have been. As mentioned earlier, Diablo Immortal, Blizzard's free-to-play mobile game, is also crossing over with Berserk. The approach of the two games couldn't be more different.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo Immortal's Berserk crossover includes not only new cosmetics, but actual, exciting in-game events. It features a boss battle against the menacing Nosferatu Zodd alongside unique rewards. It introduces a new Behelit-themed Legendary gem that grants players new powers and mechanics to play around. Players can even try to survive the most infamous moment in all of Berserk, the Eclipse, one where armies of demons descend on players hoping to turn them into sacrifices to dark gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Why this level of creativity is found in the free-to-play Diablo Immortal and not Diablo 4 is anyone's guess. The Dragon Slayer appearing in Diablo 4 as a Legendary or Unique item could have been an exciting addition, one that might have changed up the game's meta in a potentially fun and exciting way. A limited-time in-game event where players are marked with the Brand of Sacrifice and have to fight to survive would be right at home in Blizzard's premium ARPG. Heck, just reskin Diablo 4's endgame Infernal Hordes activity, rename it Eclipse-mode, and call it a day. It would, at least, be something.</p><p dir="ltr">Is Blizzard's Diablo 4 team stretched so thin that having enemies occasionally drop yet another currency is all it could come up with for its first ever crossover? Players have complained about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/">Diablo 4's upcoming content roadmap</a> and how it seems lacking. The fact that there is so little to Diablo 4's Berserk crossover just seems to prove the point. There is no meat or substance here. Far from making players excited about Diablo 4, it sours the idea of future crossovers, which just so happens to be one of the few things potentially worth getting excited about listed on the game's 2025 roadmap.</p><p dir="ltr">It remains to be seen what IP Diablo 4 will cross over with next or what it will entail; according to the roadmap, it will come between September and December of this year. But Blizzard's lack of effort and creativity here doesn't inspire much confidence. Berserk and Diablo 4 should have been a perfect pairing. Instead, it's just a reminder of what these IP collabs often are--a chance to make a buck.</p>

Players start in a cabin and are tasked with surviving a several kilometers trek across the map to reach a weather tower. Along the way players will need to manage their body temperature, hunger, and hydration, with a heavy emphasis being put on a player's ability to stay warm.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those interested in participating in the Go Wayback! closed beta can sign-up on the official PlayerUnknown Productions <a href="https://discord.com/invite/playerunknownproductions?utm_campaign=PLAYERUNKNOWN+Productions+Launch+Closed+Beta+for+Prologue%3A+Go+Wayback%21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/prologue-go-wayback-brendan-greene-interview?utm_campaign=PLAYERUNKNOWN+Productions+Launch+Closed+Beta+for+Prologue%3A+Go+Wayback%21&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>, PlayerUknown himself, Brendan Greene, said that unlike most other survival games, Go Wayback! emphasizes body temperature as a key factor of survival. For that reason the game features a robust fire simulation, where players will need to pile together kindling and spark a flame to create fire as opposed to simply selecting "campfire" from a crafting menu. Objects that seem burnable in the game, even items in the cabin like books and drink coasters, probably are, giving players freedom in how to approach the game's survival situations.</p><p dir="ltr">While a game in its own right (one that will launch in early access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic Games Store</a>), Go Wayback! is also a testbed for a larger, more ambitious game PlayerUnknown Productions calls Project Artemis. It's a currently more ephemeral idea that Greene describes as a blend of Minecraft and "3D version of the internet" where players will be able to create worlds, towns, and cities and have thousands of other players populate them.</p><p dir="ltr">Go Wayback! serves as a systemic foundation for Project Artemis. A playable engine showcase called Preface released for free last year and shows off the planet-generating tech that will power Artemis. A currently untitled game, one that Greene describes as "Command &amp; Conquer but first-person" and with tens or hundreds of players, will come next and also serve as a component of what will ultimately become Artemis.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Go Wayback! itself, Greene was heavily inspired by the popular survival game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rust/" data-ref-id="5000-222021">Rust</a> and its emergent gameplay. Scott Davidson, Rust's former art director, now works as Go Wayback's creative director. Though Go Wayback! is currently a single-player experience, Greene said he does want to eventually add co-op multiplayer. The team is currently estimating the game will be in early access for around two years.</p>

                <p>La Quimera, the story-driven FPS from the developers formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, was recently delayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145"><em>after </em>reviews for the game went live</a>, and now the developers have reverted the game to early access instead of a 1.0 launch. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">out now on Steam Early Access for $30.</a></p><p>Reburn CEO Dmytro Lymar said in a statement, "Though this wasn't our original plan, as Ukrainian game developers, we're very familiar with perseverance in the face of tough choices and tougher odds."</p><p>As with other early access titles, La Quimera will grow and evolve over time with future updates, the developer said. When the game was originally delayed, the developer said it encountered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/la-quimera-delayed-just-after-reviews-went-live/1100-6531145/" data-ref-id="1100-6531145">"some unforeseen challenges"</a> related to La Quimera being the company's first title as an independent studio.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-OBrFTGwWI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n-OBrFTGwWI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game is set in the year 2064, a time when most nation states are extinct due to human and natural disasters that caused the collapse of global systems. Against this backdrop, private military companies are thriving, with players taking on the role of a PMC operative fighting through Latin America and battling against other factions.</p><p>The story was created by Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive and Only God Forgives) and E.J.A. Warren.</p><h2>La Quimera screenshots</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449821"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449821-laquimerascreenshot14.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449822,1300-4449823,1300-4449824,1300-4449825,1300-4449826,1300-4449827,1300-4449828,1300-4449829,1300-4449830,1300-4449831,1300-4449832,1300-4449833,1300-4449834,1300-4449835" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449822-laquimerascreenshot1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449823-laquimerascreenshot2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449824-laquimerascreenshot3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449825-laquimerascreenshot4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449826-laquimerascreenshot5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449827-laquimerascreenshot6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449828-laquimerascreenshot7.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449829-laquimerascreenshot8.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449830-laquimerascreenshot9.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449831-laquimerascreenshot10.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449832-laquimerascreenshot11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449833-laquimerascreenshot12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449834-laquimerascreenshot13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4449835-laquimerascreenshot15.jpg"></figure><p>Reburn is made up of developers who previously worked on the Metro series, which consisted of adaptations of Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky's Metro books.

                <p dir="ltr">The odds of an Xbox-branded handheld arriving this year look like they're increasing. That's because images have leaked of the ROG Ally 2, with one version sporting an Xbox button and better specs, according to <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>. This would confirm reports from earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">Microsoft was partnering with Asus on a portable device</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/94G8LA/status/1919936711423135892" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, user Huang514 posted pictures of two different variations of the ROG Ally 2. The black version is supposedly the Xbox-branded edition of the hardware, apparently boasting an eight-core AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and 64GB of memory. The images were discoverable after <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-ally-2-diduga-segera-rilis-di-indonesia-dapat-sertifikat-sdppi-postel/" rel="nofollow ">website 91mobiles</a> spotted Indonesian certification office entries for the devices from Asus. Keep in mind that <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1906769447341510708" rel="nofollow ">the official Xbox account on X</a> teased a collaboration with Asus in March, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This all certainly sounds like project Kennan. In addition, in possibly a happenstance moment, The Verge's Tom Warren noted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomwarren.co.uk/post/3lollkmjcic2f" rel="nofollow ">on BlueSky</a> that the Xbox app on PC just received an update that adds battery status and Wi-Fi signal icons for the compact mode. These newly implemented features certainly seem relevant in light of the leaked images.  </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-specs-reveal-a-powerful-new-steam-deck-competitor/1100-6513495/">The ROG Ally launched</a> in mid-2023 and became a Steam Deck competitor. Last year, Asus delivered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rog-ally-x-handheld-is-a-mid-gen-refresh/1100-6523336/">a mid-generation refresh with the ROG Ally X</a>, sporting a bigger battery and more RAM. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">it's believed Microsoft is working internally on its own Xbox handheld</a> that could come out in 2027 along with a new home console.</p><p dir="ltr">What will be intriguing for this apparent Xbox edition of the ROG Ally 2 relates to the handheld's price tag. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft just raised Xbox Series X|S console prices</a>--Series X now costs $600--and stated that select first-party games will retail for $80 this holiday season.</p>

                                        <p>The beloved cult-classic, Ragnarok X: Next Generation (ROX), is making its triumphant launch in the Americas, Australia, New Zealand and Western Europe on May 8th. Developed by Gravity Game Hub (GGH)--the original creators of Ragnarok Online--ROX is a free-to-play remake featuring enhanced full 3D visuals and fresh gameplay mechanics that bring the magic of the original series forward for a new generation.</p><p>With pre-registrations live on PC, iOS, and Android, GameSpot is here to tell you everything you need to know about Ragnarok X: Next Generation and how it introduces the next chapter of the Ragnarok series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486452"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486452-picture1rox-kv-1280x1720.jpg"></figure><h4>Explore a living, breathing, player-driven world</h4><p>In Ragnarok X: Next Generation, combat is just one of many ways to enjoy the adventure. Rox is a dynamic world with a real in-game economy shaped directly by player activity. Venture into dungeons to uncover rare loot to trade, or take on life skill jobs like fishing, mining, and farming to gather resources for yourself and to sell in the market. Just like in real life, the in-game market is in constant flux, creating an immersive environment that rewards player resourcefulness and ingenuity.</p><p>The major cities of ROX are also constantly evolving. Explore them solo or with friends to uncover hidden quests, secret dungeons, and limited-time events. Or kick back and relax--shop for new gear, complete your daily chores, and partake in mini-games like Battle of Arms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5CfjQM7onE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A5CfjQM7onE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h4>Forge your path alone or with friends</h4><p>Whether you're tackling Midgard's challenges by yourself or teaming up with friends, ROX lets you choose your path. Going solo is a satisfying way to overcome obstacles and build something of your very own, but when you're ready to band together via cross-play, you and your adventurer buddies can clear dungeons, hunt powerful MVP bosses, and unravel the world's many mysteries.</p><p>The new and improved guild system makes joining a guild or building and managing your own a simple affair. Guilds aren't just opportunities to join fellow players to find quests but also to take part in events and earn some excellent rewards, ranging from exclusive offline prizes to in-game loot. Anyone who forms or joins a guild to partake in guild events qualifies for rewards, so don't be afraid to invite your friends or make new ones within ROX’s lively community.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486455"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486455-picture3gameplay.jpg"></figure><h4>Choose from six evolving classes</h4><p>From the moment you step into Midgard, players' destinies can branch into six professions, each with unique paths, signature abilities, and legendary gear:</p><ul><li>Swordsmen can embrace the stalwart defence of the Knight or – for team boosting buffs--the holy might of the Crusader</li><li>Mages harness elements as Wizards to unleash devastating spells or refine their magical arts into supportive Sages for enchantments to turn the tide of battle.</li><li>Archers can progress to become Hunters whose arrows block out the sun, or a harmonious Bard for inspirational melodies to aid teammates.</li><li>Acolytes can become Priests whose healing abilities can safeguard their comrades, or channel their faith into Monks' chants, which offer both damage and protection.</li><li>Thieves can either take the stealthy route to become a deadly Assassin, or they can use their cunning to become a Rogue, where their unique tricks and speed can give them the edge.</li><li>Merchants can become Blacksmiths to master the art of weapon and armour creation, or Alchemists to brew special potions and elixirs that can reshape the flow of combat.</li></ul><p>As you play, you'll unlock new Tiers in your chosen profession to gain even more powerful skills, plus exclusive mounts and class-specific equipment. All these elements mean that you can fine-tune your build for any challenge, whether it's PvE raids, PvP showdowns, or all-out Guild v Guild brawls.</p><p>Every drop is yours to trade, and with the economy of the game driven by the player, trading your equipment, along with the bounty from your fishing, cooking, and mining activities, is very much encouraged. Whatever path you choose, be it the path of steel or the road of ingenuity, the journey is unique to you.</p><h4>Fully customisable real-time gameplay</h4><p>Job classes in Ragnarok X: Next Generation have roles tailored to specific playstyles. These can be further customised by equipping different weapon types and allocating skill points to boost specific stats. Play as an archer with boosted vitality to increase your HP and stay in the fight for longer, or play as a fleet-footed acolyte with a boosted dexterity stat to evade enemy attacks while keeping the team alive with healing magic.</p><p>Combat in ROX takes place in real time, with fast, responsive controls that can be fully customised on both mobile and PC. The improved auto-battle and pathfinding systems let players dynamically engage enemies using preset tactics and locate and complete quests automatically.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486456"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4486456-picture4cta.jpg"></figure><h4>A cult-classic reborn</h4><p>Whether you're new to the franchise or a seasoned veteran, Ragnarok X: Next Generation delivers a fresh experience that blends nostalgia with modern, intuitive gameplay set in a charming, colourful, and vibrant world. As an award-winning free-to-play MMORPG that avoids pay-to-win mechanics, ROX is the most accessible entry in the franchise yet, giving players the freedom to forge their own journey, shape their identity, and immerse themselves in the decades-long story that started it all.</p><p>Recognized by Google Play as the Best Game of the Year, Best Competitive Game, and Best Tablet Game, ROX continues to redefine the future of mobile MMORPGs. Combining nostalgic appeal with cross-platform gameplay, ROX brings an unparalleled gaming experience that redefines what players expect from an MMORPG. Join over 20 million players already online when Ragnarok X: Next Generation launches on May 8 across North America, South America, and Western Europe on PC, App Store, and Google Play.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Since the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Direct aired on April 2, Nintendo has published a weekly video series called Creator's Voice, in which developers working on games for the Nintendo Switch 2 speak about the experience. The latest video features Square Enix's Naoki Hamaguchi, director of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy, who confirmed that all three FF7 Remake games will eventually come to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was included among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/#1">games coming to Switch 2</a> mentioned during the Direct, but the Creator's Voice video is the first confirmation that all three games--Remake, Rebirth, and the as-yet-unnamed third game--will launch on Nintendo's new console in the future. No official release dates have been confirmed for the Switch 2 ports of Remake and Rebirth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wm68MEd3d5c" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wm68MEd3d5c" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">During the interview, Hamaguchi revealed that, despite his 24 years of experience developing games, this is the first time he'll be creating something for a Nintendo console. "When I first saw the Switch 2, I was intrigued," Hamaguchi says in the video. "I felt it would have enough power to run the FF7 remake series I was creating. That's what convinced me to get involved."</p><p dir="ltr">FF7 Remake Intergrade isn't the only Square Enix game confirmed for Switch, with Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster launching on June 5--the same day as the console itself. Other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Switch 2 launch titles</a> include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition, and updated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-getting-switch-2-edition-enhanced-versions/2900-6398/" data-ref-id="2900-6398">Switch 2 Edition</a> versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">The third game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, meanwhile, has seen no details emerge other than a confirmation of its existence during the Final Fantasy 7 Anniversary stream in June 2022. Recently, the development team confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/" data-ref-id="1100-6528974">work on the third game began immediately</a> after Rebirth was completed, and that the story scenario had been fully written as of the end of 2024.</p>
