                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful. Until then, jump in and let us know how these changes are feeling once you’ve gotten a few matches under your belt.</p><p>P.S.: For those unaware, each victory in a Capture Zone awards that team 2,000 Essence, so get on it!</p><ul><li>Enemy-based melee damage against players now escalates faster than Standard Zombies modes.  <ul><li>Starting at Round 1, enemies will do increased melee damage (1.5x) in Grief.</li><li>Enemy melee damage will continue to scale to a maximum scalar (4x) after round 20.</li></ul></li><li>Increased GobbleGum machine cooldown to 5 minutes.</li><li>Salvage pickup value reduced from 100 to 50.</li><li>Self-Revive crafting limit reduced to 1 per player.</li><li>Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection Support items can no longer drop from Special or Elite enemies.</li><li>AFK players are now kicked after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li></ul><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>AS VAL</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented players from viewing Barrel attachments for the AS VAL.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>UI </b></h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s Equipment and Field Upgrade HUD elements could appear grayed-out when another player activated Mutant Injection.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed various stability issues.</li></ul>

"IO has done--we've really been blessed--five original IPs from the ground up, throughout the years. We're doing our sixth which is a fantasy project."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>

It connects via USB-C and has an additional USB-C port for passthrough charging. Razer upgraded some of the components to offer a more premium experience than its previous V2 Pro and Ultra models of the Kishi.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger pulls are registered by Hall Effect sensors, but the full-sized thumbsticks are fitted with TMR sensors (Tunnel Magnetoresistance). TMR electromagnetic sticks have only been used by a few major controller manufacturers thus far.

The Kishi V3 Pro models are the first dedicated mobile controllers from a major manufacturer to utilize TMR sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL has two remappable back buttons and a pair of extra shoulder buttons geared toward claw-grip players. It has Razer's mecha-tactile face buttons and an 8-way D-pad activated by microswitches. Both handles are shaped like traditional controller grips, and each one has a rumble motor with Sensa HD Haptics, Razer's proprietary rumble system designed to increase immersion--it's the same general idea as Nintendo's HD Rumble and PlayStation's DualSense haptics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Kishi controllers support Razer's Nexus App, a game launcher for native iOS and Android games, as well as Razer PC Remote Play. If you have an iPad with powerful enough specs--M1 or better is recommended--you could use the new Kishi V3 Pro XL to play a few of the AAA games that have been ported to Apple platforms, including Death Stranding and multiple Resident Evil games, on a giant Nintendo Switch-like handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL includes a six-month subscription to Apple Arcade for new and eligible returning subscribers.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro for Phones &amp; Tablets up to 8"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kishi V3 Pro has the same tech as the XL model, just geared toward smaller mobile devices.

It still has TMR sticks, remappable back buttons, and Hall Effect triggers, but it drops a couple features and makes changes to several components to keep the price down. It doesn't have the claw-grip bumpers or Sensa HD Haptics, and the face buttons and D-pad don't have the mouse-click feel and feedback. The four-way D-pad and buttons are "Quiet-tactile," which is likely a fancy way to say they feel conventional.</p><p>The Kishi V3 should fit most Android smartphones thanks to its "island" design and thicker depth clearance, and it also comes with three months of Apple Arcade for free.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Razer isn't the only player in this game, as GameSir offers its own controller cradle for tablets.

This one syncs via Bluetooth and supports iOS and Android devices up to 8.5 inches. It's also compatible with Nintendo Switch and the new Switch 2, which is a big perk.</p><p>Smartphone owners can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/" data-ref-id="1100-6531316">check out the new Backbone Pro</a>, which offers a pro-style setup to mobile gaming. Building off of the foundation established by the Backbone One, this snap-on USB-C controller for iPhone 15/16 and Android phones is an impressive upgrade compared to its predecessor.</p><p>You can also use it as a wireless Bluetooth controller on tablets, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and more devices, and it's highly customizable via the official Backbone App. Overall, this is a comfier and feature-packed successor to the Backbone One. Like Razer's V3 Pro controllers, the Backbone Pro is pricier than many mobile controllers at $170.</p><hr>

                <p>Amazon is currently offering discounts on select gaming chairs, including a few models with high-end features like built-in speakers, footrests, and additional lumbar support. Inventory is limited, and because some models are <strong>on sale at their lowest prices ever</strong>, they’re bound to sell out fast. Unfortunately, these chairs won’t ship in time for Father’s Day, but if you’re shopping for yourself (or someone patient), now is a great time to scoop up a budget gaming chair at a great low price.</p><div title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3692" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest (Ocean Blue)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $180)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the best price ever for the GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest.

This black edition also features grey accents along the edges and a stitched backrest that appears more premium than its price would suggest. Beyond that, you’re getting many of the standard gaming chair features--including a 165-degree reclining angle, a wide seat, and a weight capacity up to 300 pounds. Note that this model is discontinued, so this may be the last chance to grab it before it sells out.</p>                      </div>

                <p dir="ltr">It's more or less agreed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/yakuza-0/" data-ref-id="5000-295563">Yakuza 0</a> is really good--many will even say the best in the whole series. But with the Switch 2's launch lineup being somewhat sparse, Sega (and Nintendo, which has timed exclusivity on this edition) are likely hoping players want to complement their Mario Karting, Cyberpunk 2077ing, and Street Fighting with a hard-hitting open-world adventure. But is it worth it? It really depends.</p><p dir="ltr">At $50, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is cheaper than many of the other Switch 2 launch games, and there's a lot to do here between the lengthy, dual-protagonist narrative and the surprisingly involving minigames. You can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of Yakuza 0: Director's Cut, and that's not even taking into account the new content.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Switch 2's Yakuza 0 Director's Cut Is An Upgraded Version Aimed At Old And New Fans</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The first major difference is the addition of new voice and subtitle tracks. Your choice of voice actors is down to personal preference, but for me, the Japanese ones are too iconic to switch away from. Chinese and English voice tracks have been recorded for the entire game. If you're a series veteran, you'll also notice that the demo cinematic features the Japanese rock song "Bubble" by Shounan no Kaze--a song featured in the original Yakuza 0's Japanese release but excised overseas. It's back, it's rockin', and it sets the stage for a grand old time in 1988 Bubble Era Japan.</p><p dir="ltr">At the title screen, there's a mode selectable right off the bat: Red Light Raid, which has you and up to four online or offline companions beating up waves of hooligans for fun and profit. I was intrigued by this mode, hoping it might serve as a callback to classic multiplayer arcade brawlers--some of which were made by Sega itself. What I actually got was somewhat underwhelming: You pick a character out of a massive roster (many of which require a good amount of in-game cash to unlock) and take them into battle with up to four player- or CPU-controlled companions. You'll pick a challenge, fight wave after wave of enemies, sometimes encountering a boss fight, before dealing with a final boss. Finishing a challenge run earns you lots of sweet, sweet yen.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751" data-ratio="0.56246961594555" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512751"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut looks on par with the original game on PS4.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512751-screenshot2025-06-12105245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can do all the fun head-cracking, chest-smashing moves here as you can in the base game (though both Kiryu and Majima require you to pick one fighting style and stick with it). It's a way to play as characters who are otherwise uncontrollable in the base game, which is nice. But overall it feels undercooked: Characters vary wildly in usefulness, and the sessions can devolve into messy chaos, especially in dark settings and on the Switch 2's handheld mode. It's obvious this game's combat, which frequently takes place in narrow streets, corridors, and cluttered rooms, wasn't built for multiplayer originally—and it frequently feels crowded and hard to get your bearings even on more open arenas. There’s a mix of character models and moves mostly mashed together from this game and others in the series, including a lot of barely-seen NPCs. Still, if you can get your friend group together in a GameChat channel as you play, you'll have some fun.</p><p dir="ltr">Graphically, I didn't notice any major changes or upgrades compared to the PS4 original--the textures look mostly identical and the character models seem to be a 1:1 port, though the Switch 2 version does include 4K support.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752" data-ratio="0.56149732620321" data-width="2057" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4512752"></a><figcaption>The Director's Cut adds five brand-new cutscenes to the game's story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4512752-screenshot2025-06-12105224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the bigger selling points has been the addition of five brand-new cutscenes--almost a half-hour's worth. I got the impression that these new scenes were meant to give some additional screen time to characters who fell by the wayside in the original, along with additional screentime for the Kiryu and Nishikiyama duo. They’re certainly a nice addition, though how much you’ll get from them depends on how invested in the cast you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Yakuza 0 Director's Cut is definitely an upgrade--but the biggest elephant in the room is that the original Yakuza 0 has <em>frequently</em> gone on very deep discount on Steam and elsewhere; during some sales, you could pick this saga up for well under $10. Even at a lower-than-average price of $50, this poses the question: Do the additional cutscenes, voice/subtitle languages, and other extra content in Director's Cut make up for that big price hike? For me, no--I like this series a lot, but I'm not hungry enough for new Yakuza to want to pay a huge premium for some extras that ultimately don't add all <em>that</em> much. But if you can't get enough of that crime drama, English isn't your first language, or you just have to have an English or Chinese voice track, then go ahead and grab it--it's a fantastic time.</p>

                <p>Though Microsoft never announced an official Xbox handheld device, there were rumors about how such a device <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">might factor into the company's next-gen console plans</a>. Those plans are continuing to evolve, it seems, as a new report said Microsoft's own Xbox handheld is "essentially canceled."</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, citing insiders, said such a device is no longer going forward. This follows on from a report at the end of May that suggested <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reportedly-pauses-development-on-xbox-handheld/1100-6531934/" data-ref-id="1100-6531934">plans for an Xbox handheld were sidelined.</a></p><p>The Verge's report added that Microsoft remains bullish on the idea of making "next-gen Xbox hardware," but perhaps not in the way people think. "We'll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles," the report said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SOKm9dDOSC8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spencer alluded to a closer collaboration between PC and console in a recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox podcast interview.</a> "This is the tightest collaboration I've seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company," he said. Spencer also mentioned how Windows PC is an open platform and that he believes, if managed properly, a PC can be considered "as a game console."</p><p>While Microsoft may not develop its own dedicated gaming handheld device, the company is working with third-party devices like the recently announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">Rog Ally handhelds from Asus.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details on the company's plans for handheld devices going forward.</p><p>In February 2024, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p>The new Xbox Rog Ally devices launch this holiday, but there is no word on pricing as of yet. The systems can play all types of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-pc-games-run-on-the-new-xbox-handheld/1100-6532289/" data-ref-id="1100-6532289">including PlayStation PC titles.</a></p>
