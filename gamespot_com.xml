                <p>Besides the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">$80 price point</a>, one of the biggest talking points about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> has been the Cow. Producer Kosuke Yabuki has now reacted to the excitement about the Cow, and re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">the Cow does in fact eat burgers</a>, but they may not be real-beef burgers.</p><p>"The decision to include Cow was something that we considered in terms of if we added that, I think people would be really happy about it. And so we did," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yabuki told IGN</a>. "But honestly, the reaction to that by the public was much bigger than we possibly could have anticipated. So that was a wonderful surprise."</p><p>As discussed previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">a "silly sketch" led to the creation of the Cow</a>, who has become one of the game's most popular characters in the lead up to release.</p><p>Yabuki went on to say that the Cow "really opened the floodgates" for Nintendo because it inspired the developers to wonder, "'Well, maybe we should just add who we can.'" Thinking this way, the developers also chose to add the Penguin and Pokey.</p><p>"Because all of these characters came in such a rush as the designers were getting kind of carried away, it's actually a little hard for me to remember which specific character would've come immediately next in the sequence after Cow," Yabuki said. "Because honestly, I have this memory of approving the concept for Cow, and then maybe the next day I had 10 proposals for other characters on my desk."</p><p>Given that Mario Kart World has a new mechanic that lets players stop at roadside restaurants and grab a bite to eat, many have been wondering if the Cow can stop for a burger or steak. The creature can, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily eating its own kind. Asked if the Cow specifically consumers beef or veggie burgers, Kabuki said, "Sorry that's top secret. I can't say."</p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.

                <p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that GameChat, one of Nintendo's purported marquee features for the upcoming Switch 2, did not show well when it was first revealed. The introduction to the feature in the Switch reveal trailer looked choppy and poor quality. While I and others gave them credit for showing the feature in a "warts and all" state, it was a confusing choice to center so much of the presentation around a video-sharing function that looked, well, bad. Having now spent some time with GameChat at an extensive hands-on preview, I can't say I'm confident that the final quality will be any better than we saw--but I am sure that the ease of use and system integration make it a nicer prospect than it first appeared.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/">first hands-on with the Switch 2</a>, GameChat was fully enabled for this session, which meant I was free to poke around the options and see how it all worked. GameChat is a main-menu option right alongside others like the Nintendo eShop and controller settings, so it's easy to find even without the dedicated button. But the C button does call up the menu quickly, which is nice for toggling its various options on and off.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Those options include voice, video, and game sharing--the latter being the less-than-stellar game feed from your friends. You can turn on any combination of these options, and as promised, you can bring up your friend's game screen to watch them. It came up after a short delay and ran more smoothly than the choppy video shown in the Direct, when it was the main video feed. I should say, though, that the game being showcased for this feature was Zelda: Four Swords Adventures running through the GBA Classics app, so it wasn't exactly a game that was taxing system resources like Mario Kart World. The connection was also running via LAN rather than Wi-Fi, so that could have also conceivably improved my experience.</p><p dir="ltr">We played a short tutorial of Four Swords Adventures across multiple consoles with GameChat on, and we were allowed to toggle whichever features we liked, as well as explore some of the various options. If you just want to chat and don't care about sharing video, you can go full-screen and still see your friends' voices lighting up in the corner when they speak. You can turn on voice-to-text and see a text box offering what is at least a close approximation (with some understandable typos) of what they've said, identified with their usernames. That feature is offered as an accessibility option but could also be useful for those of us who play with the volume low when family members are asleep. The system also does a decent job automatically raising and lowering the game volume to accommodate voices, if you have that option selected.</p><p dir="ltr">It also seems smartly targeted at ease of use and families, which you'd expect from Nintendo, and the company commented on it when it first debuted the feature. You can quickly turn off individual shared screens--for example, if a friend is playing an M-rated game and your young children enter the room. Nintendo has also detailed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-parental-controls-let-you-block-kids-from-using-video-in-gamechat/1100-6531978/">kid-safe features</a> to make sure your children are only interacting with whitelisted contacts. And if you see your friend playing a game you don't recognize, it's easy to hop into its game page for more information.</p><p dir="ltr">None of these features are exactly revolutionary, and in many ways GameChat and GameShare represent Nintendo catching up to the norms of online play on other platforms. But it is smartly implemented and user-friendly in a way that feels characteristic for Nintendo's general sense of ease, if not its history with online connectivity. I'm still not convinced GameChat is a marquee feature for the Nintendo Switch 2. But after eight years of playing on the first Switch, it's a solid nice-to-have that makes the successor that much more appealing.</p>

                <p>Poinpy, a platformer from developer Ojiro Fumoto AKA Moppin and published by Devolver, launched in 2022 exclusively through Netflix, but it's going away soon. The game will be removed on June 9, according to a disclaimer in the Netflix mobile app.</p><p>A spokesperson for Devolver <a href="https://discord.com/channels/439391039720259585/439391040508657666/1372345262772584548" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Discord</a> that the company's deal with Netflix is ending, which is why Poinpy is leaving the Netflix catalog.</p><p>"The deal with Netflix has expired, so as you already know, Poinpy will leave Netflix very soon. For the time being, Poinpy will become unavailable, and we know this sucks," the person, Modkiq, said. "With how these integrations work, Poinpy will require further development in order to be releasable in other stores, and realistically we do not know when we would have time in between other projects."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kKWuKXHyfw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6kKWuKXHyfw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>What this means in essence is that when Poinpy leaves Netflix, it won't be available anywhere until it is potentially brought to another system--but there is no guarantee that will ever happen. It's not clear what will happen if you already have Poinpy installed on your mobile device after it's removed from the catalog.</p><p>Poinpy isn't the first game to leave the Netflix catalog, as Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition left in 2024. GTA: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition remains available on Netflix, however.</p><p>"Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-grand-theft-auto-games-are-leaving-netflixs-game-library-soon/1100-6527923/" data-ref-id="1100-6527923">confirmed in 2024.</a></p><p>Netflix's library of games can be played on mobile devices by way of downloads or streamed over the internet on your TV or browser. There are no microtransactions or in-game ads for any of the games.</p>
