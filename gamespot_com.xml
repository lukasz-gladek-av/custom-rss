                <p>It's been a while since we've seen anything new from the hotly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong. However, there's a chance that it could show up during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a> on April 2.</p><p>On January 15, the day before Nintendo officially announced the Switch 2, Hollow Knight creator William Pellen said on Twitter, "something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow." At the end of the Switch 2 reveal trailer, Nintendo also announced that it will host a Switch 2-focused Direct on April 2.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1879751713621725206%7Ctwgr%5E7566f332bf5134f452671fdd10c30fdba68bab45%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Fsilksong-fans-believe-creators-switch-2-hint-points-to-april-announcement-and-its-all-thanks-to-a-slice-of-cake" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">something big is coming. keep your eyes closed tomorrow</p>  â€” little bomey (@everydruidwaswr) <a href="https://twitter.com/everydruidwaswr/status/1879751713621725206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The hints don't stop there. Pellen changed his Twitter profile picture to a slice of cake. A reverse image search on Google of the picture reveals that the recipe of the cake was posted on April 2, 2024. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1i31gas/what_we_know_so_far_about_the_william_pellen/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fans think that this was a deliberate move</a>, and that Pellen is hinting that Hollow Knight: Silksong will be shown at the April 2025 Nintendo Direct.</p><p>Fans have been wondering when Hollow Knight: Silksong would be released, hoping that it would show up at various <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-april-17-how-to-watch-and-start-time/1100-6522678/" data-ref-id="1100-6522678">Indie World Directs</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-bethesda-games-showcase-2022/2300-6458585/" data-ref-id="2300-6458585">Xbox Game Showcases</a> over the past few years. But those hopes never materialized. The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley even had to temper expectations and confirmed that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/1100-6525900/" data-ref-id="1100-6525900">wasn't going to be shown at Gamescom 2024</a>.</p><p>As for other Switch 2 games, very little information has been revealed publicly, but it appears <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">a new Mario Kart game</a> is coming to the system.

                <p>Earlier this week, Nintendo released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-apes-hit/1900-6418328/" data-ref-id="1900-6418328">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, the remaster of the Wii and 3DS video game that was developed by Retro Studios. However, players have noted that the original team members at Retro are not given individual credits in the updated version. Instead, the credits state that it was "based on the work" of Retro Studios, while the team at Forever Entertainment gets its credits for working on the remaster. Now, Nintendo has issued a statement about the situation.</p><p>"We believe in giving proper credit for anyone involved in making or contributing to a game's creation, and value the contributions that all staff make during the development process," said a Nintendo spokesperson to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>.</p><p>That statement doesn't really address why the original team's names were excluded from the credits, and this has happened before. In 2023, the Retro Studios developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-metroid-prime-developers-express-frustration-at-being-excluded-from-remasters-credits/1100-6511491/" data-ref-id="1100-6511491">left out of the credits</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-remains-a-revelation/1100-6511575/" data-ref-id="1100-6511575">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/external-translators-are-frustrated-with-lack-of-credit-in-nintendo-games/1100-6524935/" data-ref-id="1100-6524935">external translators voiced their frustrations</a> last year because Nintendo didn't credit them for their work either.</p><p>This story has been largely overshadowed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">the reveal of Switch 2</a> earlier this week. It seems likely that the Donkey Kong Country franchise will be revisited on that system as well. However, it's not among the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">games rumored for Switch 2</a>. In the meantime, the bizarre Donkey Kong Country animated TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nightmare-fuel-donkey-kong-country-tv-series-is-free-to-watch-on-youtube-and-amazon/1100-6505494/" data-ref-id="1100-6505494">is still available to watch on Prime Video</a>.</p>

                <p>In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a>, the end of one chapter almost always leads into another. The recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-gets-new-legendary-weapons-and-increased-caps-in-revenant-act-3/1100-6528729/" data-ref-id="1100-6528729">conclusion of Revenant Act 3</a> set the stage for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-past-is-prologue-event-starts-soon-offering-hard-to-get-rewards-in-new-ways/1100-6528865/" data-ref-id="1100-6528865">the Past is Prologue event</a> starting on January 21. Looking even further ahead, the next episode, Hersey, is set to launch next month with a brand-new dungeon, Sundered Doctrine.</p><p>The new dungeon will bring players back to SavathÃ»nâ€™s Throne World as they infiltrate the Pyramid Ship of their old enemy Rhulk, who was dispatched by the Guardians in The Vow of the Disciple. Rhulk may be gone, but there are bound to be some nasty surprises waiting for players inside his ship. And the best players in the game are invited to take part in competitive race to finish Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode, which has enhanced difficulty and an even greater challenge than the normal settings.</p><p>Ahead of the debut of Sundered Doctrine, we've put together this guide to everything you need to know about the race, including how to enter it, how to watch, and what has to be done to claim the ultimate reward for this event.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_does_Sundered_Doctrine_launch_">When does Sundered Doctrine launch?</a></li><li><a href="#What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</a></li><li><a href="#How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</a></li><li><a href="#What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_does_Sundered_Doctrine_launch_">When does Sundered Doctrine launch?</h2><p>Sundered Doctrine will launch on Friday, February 7. For the first 48 hours, players will compete in a race to be the first to finish Sundered Doctrine in the more difficult Contest Mode. This time, there can only be one winning fireteam, and the contest will conclude as soon as someone pulls off that feat.</p><h2 id="What_are_the_requirements_to_enter_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What are the requirements to enter Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>During the first 48 hours after Sundered Doctrine's debut, any fireteam of three players can enter the Contest Mode if all team members are at 1995 Power Level or higher. Each member of the team is also required to own The Final Shape Dungeon Key and the The Drowning Labyrinth quest before entering Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_can_players_complete_Sundered_Doctrine_">How can players complete Sundered Doctrine?</h2><p>It's not an exaggeration to say this is going to take a team effort, because the only way that Sundered Doctrine can be conquered is if each member of the fireteam has completed and received loot for every encounter. Additionally, it has to be the first time completing the encounter for every member of the team.</p><p>Assuming players make it past the final encounter of Sundered Doctrine, they have to loot the final chest to officially record their victory. But it's not going to be easy, as Contest Mode has a very high difficulty with more aggressive enemies and an enrage mechanic that limits the number of phases or the time players have left to complete it. Having a higher power level than 1995 won't give anyone a special advantage, as that will be the cap for every player in this contest. There will also be resurrection tokens during encounters.</p><h2 id="What_will_players_win_for_finishing_Sundered_Doctrine_s_Contest_Mode_">What will players win for finishing Sundered Doctrine's Contest Mode?</h2><p>The three players on the winning fireteam will receive a special emblem and a guaranteed exotic weapon drop. However, Bungie hasn't yet shared the details about which exotic weapon will be featured in Sundered Doctrine.</p><h2 id="How_to_watch_the_Sundered_Doctrine_race">How to watch the Sundered Doctrine race</h2><p>The DungeonZone coverage of the Sundered Doctrine race will begin with a pre-show at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on Friday, February 2. The live coverage will start two hours later at 9 AM PT / 12 PM ET. Fans can follow the action at the following outlets:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitch.tv/evanf1997" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TikTok</a></li></ul><p>Note that the TikTok stream will only be active if the site isn't shut down as scheduled on Sunday, January 19. In 2024, the US government passed a law to ban TikTok if the site wasn't sold by the Chinese company ByteDance. As of January 17, that seems unlikely to happen before the deadline.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429255" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4429255"></a><figcaption>The Trigonic Amber emblem from Destiny 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4429255-trigonicamberemblem.jpg"></figure><p>Viewers who watch the live coverage will be able to claim the Trigonic Amber emblem for free.
