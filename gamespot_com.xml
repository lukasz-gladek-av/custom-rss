                <p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/1uPFqvuRRej3UoemTIgVLH/18f1d055777e1b39a3f79a951452b9e1/2025.03.27_-_Press_Release_vfinal.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced a major change</a> to its organization as it looks to the future, as the company has created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on three main franchises: Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Tencent is investing â‚¬1.16 billion ($1.25 billion USD) to take a minority stake (about 25%) in this new subsidiary.</p><p>Ubisoft said the parts of its business that are not included in this new entity, including The Division and Ghost Recon, along with development of certain new IP, will continue in parallel. However, it's unknown to what extent these changes could result in potential layoffs or studio closures.</p><p>"This new subsidiary will focus on building game ecosystems designed to become truly evergreen and multi-platform. Backed by greater investment and boosted creative capacities, it will drive further increases in quality of narrative solo experiences, expand multiplayer offerings with increased frequency of content release, introduce free-to-play touchpoints, and integrate more social features," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Tencent emerged as the winner following a "competitive process" under which Ubisoft considered different "strategic options." It was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/" data-ref-id="1100-6530071">Microsoft and EA were in the mix in some capacity.</a></p><p>Alongside the announcement of this new business entity, Ubisoft said it will "focus on nurturing" some of its other franchises, including Ghost Recon and The Division, while also continuing to make new IP and building out its game engine technologies and online services. Ubisoft said it will share more information "at a later stage."</p><p>Ubisoft co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot said this marks a "new chapter" in Ubisoft's history, calling this a "foundational step in changing Ubisoft's operating model."</p><p>"With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises' long-term growth and success," Guillemot said.</p><p>Tencent president Martin Lau said, "We see the immense potential for these franchises to evolve into long-term evergreen game platforms and create engaging new experiences for gamers."</p><p>In terms of further specifics, the new subsidiary includes the development teams working on Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry in Montreal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. Ubisoft said it also includes any new games in those places under development currently or that are made in the future, along with back catalog titles from those teams. This new subsidiary is getting rights to the Rainbow Six, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry franchises in exchange for an unspecified royalty payment.</p><p>It's been a tumultuous past year for Ubisoft even prior to this, as the company's cost-cutting efforts have included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">mass layoffs and studio closures</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">shutdown of XDefiant.</a></p><p>Ubisoft's latest big release was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which debuted on March 20, quickly reaching 3 million players and collecting strong reviews from critics.</p>

                <p>Despite everything, Undertale is now 10 years old. To celebrate the momentous occasion, a one-night-only orchestral concert, The Determination Symphony, has been announced. Those looking to <a href="http://www.eventimapollo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">purchase tickets</a> for the exclusive event--which will take place at London's Eventim Apollo on June 22, 2025--can do so starting tomorrow, March 28, at 6 AM ET.</p><p>According to the event's press release, the concert will run for approximately two hours and will encompass Undertale's 10-year history, taking fans on a journey from "the initial fall at Mount Ebott, and leading them through Froggit Village, the Snowdin Temple, Temmie Village, and so much more." Accompanying this adventure is a 25-piece orchestra that will be performing developer Toby Fox's original music, which has received unending praise and critical-acclaim throughout the past decade. This praise includes that given in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/undertale-review-nintendo-switch-update/1900-6416315/" data-ref-id="1900-6416315">Undertale review</a>, in which we wrote, "Undertale's soundtrack has timeless appeal and is great at evoking emotions."</p><p>Lambert Jackson Productions, the London-based studio behind the Oliver award-nominated play Cruise, will be heading production for The Determination Symphony. The event is scheduled to take place at the Eventim Apollo (formerly the Hammersmith Apollo), one of London's premiere theaters.</p><p>In other Undertale news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/undertale-sees-new-peak-for-steam-concurrent-players-nearly-a-decade-after-launching/1100-6530156/" data-ref-id="1100-6530156">recently broke its own Steam record</a> for concurrent players. After listing the game for $1 as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-steam-spring-sale-2025-deals/2900-6318/#2" data-ref-id="2900-6318">Steam Spring Sale</a>, developer Toby Fox took to X to announce the news, writing that this was the first time this had happened since the game was released back in 2015. Last October, Fox confirmed that Undertale follow-up Deltarune's next chapters will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-will-definitely-be-released-in-2025-toby-fox-says/1100-6527507/" data-ref-id="1100-6527507">released some time in 2025</a>. The first two chapters of Deltarune are currently available for free on PC, PS4, and Switch.</p>
