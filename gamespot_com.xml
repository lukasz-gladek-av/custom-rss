                <p>In October 2025, rumors suggested that Larian Studios' hit RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> could be getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-be-in-the-works-for-switch-2-report/1100-6535644/" data-ref-id="1100-6535644">a port for Nintendo's Switch 2</a>. Unfortunately, that report has turned out to be inaccurate as Larian has confirmed that its wildly popular D&amp;D will not be coming to Nintendo's console.</p><p>During a recent AMA session on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke acknowledged that the company wanted to work on a Switch 2 port, but it was denied.</p><p>"We would have loved to [bring Baldur's Gate 3 to Switch 2], but [it] wasn't our decision to make," wrote Vincke. That likely means the port was either shot down by Nintendo or by Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast, which controls the rights for all things Dungeons &amp; Dragons-related.</p><p>In another post from the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylg3dd/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> session, Vincke indicated that the "smaller" game that the company had in mind post-Baldur's Gate 3 was "another DnD game, but that ship has sailed."</p><p>Last month, Larian released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-releases-its-acclaimed-previous-game-on-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536963/" data-ref-id="1100-6536963">an upgraded version of Divinity: Original Sin II</a> on Switch 2 and other modern consoles. As revealed during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/" data-ref-id="2900-7341">The Game Awards</a>, Larian has turned its attention to a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity/" data-ref-id="5000-706358">Divinity</a> game. Vinke recently noted that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-devs-feel-more-pressure-after-baldurs-gate-3s-massive-success/1100-6537029/" data-ref-id="1100-6537029">team feels pressure</a> from the success of Baldur's Gate 3 to exceed it with their next project.</p><p>"It's more pressure," said Vincke. "The weight of the expectations weighs high. We're trying not to think about it, because we have to make our own thing."</p><p>Divinity doesn't currently have a release date.</p>
