                <p>As a game that's constantly evolving, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> is no stranger to hotfixes and patches. In fact, a new update has just gone live, and it is designed to quickly address several issues that have cropped up in the game since the start of the Into the Unjust event in the game. This new patch focuses primarily on game-breaking issues causing hard crashes, as well as buffs to the new gear introduced in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-dust-devils-warbond-all-skins-guns-and-rewards/2900-6952/" data-ref-id="2900-6952">Dust Devils warbond</a>.</p><p>For general fixes, players can expect several problems to be addressed. Developer Arrowhead says that the crashes related to there being too many particle effects, Automaton missions, and a bug with a seeking missile have been resolved with this patch. Other tweaks include the extraction shuttle landing more safely for players, hive world tunnels should no longer be darker than intended if you're using lower graphics settings, and the excessive light emitted by the Hellpad has also been toned down.</p>

<p>When it comes to weapons and stratagems, there have also been a few issues here. The LIFT-182 Warp Pack tended to make players get stuck midair, and there were also instances of the game crashing when a player aborted a mission while wielding a turret or driving a vehicle. These should all be fixed here, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halos-assault-rifle-is-causing-helldivers-2-to-crash/1100-6534292/">and it should also be safe to equip the Halo ODST MA5C assault rifle</a> when you're on the bridge of your flagship.</p><p>For the buffs, Arrowhead is reducing the cooldown on the MS-11 Solo Silo and giving the S-11 Speargun a quicker reload. The silo stratagem cooldown will now drop from 210 seconds to 180 seconds, while the Speargun reload time has been cut by an entire second to just 2.5 seconds. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-major-update-introduces-new-hive-world-levels-and-fixes-the-halo-odst-gun-bug/1100-6534405/">A larger patch released earlier this week</a> also killed several bugs, allowing players more freedom so that they could also go on a bug hunt.

O'Brien noted 2K Sports as a reason why the revival isn't happening.</p><p dir="ltr">"Given there are some schools choosing to accept the 2K Sports proposal for inclusion in NBA 2K, the offer to be included in a college basketball video game will unfortunately have to be rescinded," O'Brien wrote. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6598089/2025/09/04/ea-sports-college-basketball-video-game-2k/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> reported that EA's offer required exclusive rights and was recommended by the Collegiate Licensing Company because it encompassed 730 teams (for men and women). </p><p dir="ltr">There has been conflicting info about <a href="https://x.com/MattBrownEP/status/1944719700304310765" rel="nofollow ">whether 2K will add college teams to the NBA 2K franchise</a> or make a separate game--or possibly start with DLC and then adapt. In July, a report surfaced that noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-sports-reportedly-planning-college-hoops-standalone-game-not-tied-to-nba-2k/1100-6533301/">2K Sports was planning a standalone College Hoops 2K title</a>. Other details included the company reaching out to major schools like Michigan St. and UCLA, with plans to feature 100 men's and women's programs. Meanwhile, EA CEO Andrew Wilson previously proclaimed he wanted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-wants-to-see-all-350-programs-in-college-basketball-game/1100-6533556/">"all 350 programs" for its college basketball game</a>.</p><p>EA last released a college basketball game with NCAA Basketball 10 in 2009, while College Hoops 2K8 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/college-hoops-2k9-ejected/1100-6184658/">the last entry in that series</a> in 2007.</p><p>Just last week, O'Brien noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-new-ea-college-basketball-game-is-nowhere-near-release/1100-6534297/">EA's college basketball game was nowhere near release</a>. The executive also said the company was "up for the challenge" while also acknowledging the project as a "daunting task."</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-and-time/1100-6534447/">Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally out</a>, and with the entire internet talking about Team Cherry's long-in-development metroidvania, you might be feeling some FOMO about it. The good news is that the game is relatively cheap to purchase, and if you're looking to save a few extra bucks, you can score a discount on the Steam version <em>and </em>some free games if you happen to be a Humble Choice subscriber. Right now, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fhumblebundleinc.sjv.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F2059850%2F25796%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fhollow-knight-silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get the game at a 15% discount</a>, dropping the price of Silksong from $20 to $17. Humble has temporarily sold out of keys at the moment, but a restock is on the way.</p><p>This deal is one of the perks that Humble Choice subscribers get with their monthly membership, which costs $15 a month. Alongside new PC games that are refreshed every month, you also get access to the Humble Vault--an additional rotating library of games. The best thing about the membership is that the PC games you claim are yours to keep forever, even if you decide to cancel your membership. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-wwe-2k25-and-seven-more-games-for-just-15-at-humble-this-month/1100-6534418/">This month is also pretty good</a>, as you can pick up WWE 2K25, Destiny 2: Legacy Collection, The Plucky Squire, Return to Monkey Island, and more.</p><p>If you bought Silksong and didn't get your Steam key before it sold out, Humble is offering DRM-free keys as an alternative. Speaking of DRM-free keys, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Hollow+Knight%3A+Silksong+Is+Already+Discounted%2C+But+Only+For+These+Cool+Kids&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-04+08%3A56%3A53&amp;fnarticle_id=6534484&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fhollow_knight_silksong&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-is-already-discounted-but-only-for-these-cool-kids%2F1100-6534484%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can get Silksong at its regular price of $20 through GOG</a>. The benefit here is that you're getting a DRM-free version of the game, which means the license for it will never be revoked and it can play without needing to start through a launcher. You can also easily load it onto a mobile gaming PC like an Asus ROG Ally and keep on playing, even when you're in an internet dead zone.</p><p>While Silksong is out, you might have to wait a little longer to play it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/">as various digital storefronts are experiencing a few issues</a>.

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is finally available, and it's putting up huge numbers on Steam. The game blasted off today with 5,000 concurrent players in the first five minutes, growing to 50,000 within 30 minutes and 100,000 after the first 45 minutes of availability. It's now exceeded 478,000 concurrent players.</p><p>Silksong is currently the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 most-played game on Steam right now.</a> The game is putting up these massive figures despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">numerous and serious issues on Steam</a> that are preventing people from accessing the store, let alone buying and playing the game.</p><p>The 2017 original Hollow Knight, meanwhile, capped out at a peak concurrent-player record of 72,916--a record that was, in fact, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">achieved just recently on September 3</a>. The game's player numbers no doubt spiked due to interest in the sequel.</p><p>Silksong's Steam numbers are expected to keep climbing. Historical data shows that Steam games tend to spike on weekends in terms of popularity when people generally have more free time.</p><p>Silksong is also available for console, but the same kind of player data is not available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, or Switch 2. On Xbox and PC, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-on-xbox-game-pass/1100-6534209/" data-ref-id="1100-6534209">game is also available via Game Pass</a>, so any sales data for those platforms wouldn't necessarily tell the whole story. For what it's worth, Silksong's rollout on console platforms also ran into a number of issues.</p><p>The original Hollow Knight sold more than 15 million copies.</p><p>In other Silksong news, the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-twitch-drops-how-to-get-the-hornet-badge/1100-6534483/" data-ref-id="1100-6534483">has Twitch Drops available</a> for a Hornet badge. Hornet is the playable character in Team Cherry's long-awaited sequel.</p><p>Silksong took years to come out, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-did-silksong-take-so-long-its-not-what-you-might-think/1100-6534218/" data-ref-id="1100-6534218">wasn't because the game was stuck in development hell or anything like that</a>, the developers said. Simply put, the enormous success of the first game gave the small team the time to develop the sequel at their own pace. Also adding to the lengthy development schedule was how Silksong actually began as an expansion to Hollow Knight before shifting to a standalone release.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>
