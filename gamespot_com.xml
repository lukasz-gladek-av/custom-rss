                <p>Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has discussed cancelling games during his tenure at the company, including a new IP from God of War developer Santa Monica Studio. Sony had invested $25 million into the game, saw potential in it, but ultimately decided to shut it down and eat the cost.</p><p>Yoshida said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2Plu6ciaLMfso6xWbRqQuz?go=1&amp;sp_cid=5b691c77600e893959bfe6b75f0ea351&amp;utm_source=embed_player_p&amp;utm_medium=desktop&amp;nd=1&amp;dlsi=5fccf9ee027b4228" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">My Perfect Console podcast</a> that this new game was not a God of War title, but it had a "really amazing concept and very interesting gameplay ideas." Sony worked on this game for "many years" but after spending $25 million on it, the studio itself approached Yoshida to say things were not working out.</p><p>"They came to me and said, 'We have to stop.' I do not exactly remember the reason--probably the team was not able to find the game. It was a great concept, great idea, but you know, the gameplay didn't really come to be," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/shuhei-yoshida-recalls-when-he-cancelled-two-25-million-game-projects-including-one-by-god-of-wars-santa-monica-studio/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC.</a></p><p>Yoshida did not provide a timeline for when this occurred, however. Earlier this year, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/" data-ref-id="1100-6528869">Sony canceled a live-service God of War game</a>, but the one Yoshida is speaking about was a new IP.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said cancelling games is a normal part of the business because the creative process involves lots of iteration. Cancelling games early in their development "doesn't cost us much," Yoshida said, but it was a "really hard decision" to cancel the new IP at Santa Monica Studio because of the time and money involved.</p><p>"But I think in this case, the team at Santa Monica Studio by themselves was like, 'You know, we probably have to stop,'" Yoshida said.</p><p>Yoshida also discussed another game he oversaw the cancellation of, and this was a title from an unspecified European studio. Yoshida did not share much in the way of specifics, but said this was a "big-budget project" that lacked a "core game" and did not go ahead.</p><p>"These days, $25 million cancellation is nothing special. [There are] much bigger cancellations," he said.</p><p>Yoshida went on to say cancelling these projects was ultimately in the best interest of the developers and the business overall. "If we continued, it just got bigger and bigger in terms of [financial] loss, and the developers eventually get tired of working on these. And it's not healthy to work on something that's struggling for the longest time," he said.</p><p>Yoshida added that, when the decision to cancel a game came down during his time at Sony, he tried to communicate with the developers about how it might be rough to abandon a project, but sometimes it's necessary. "Not doing this means we can do something different, something new, like brand new. So let's do the fresh restart," he said he told developers.</p><p>Yoshida also made headlines recently for saying he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/" data-ref-id="1100-6528881">"resisted" Sony's push into live-service games</a> and that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-on-the-one-playstation-game-he-was-surprised-didnt-sell-like-he-thought-it-would/1100-6528860/" data-ref-id="1100-6528860">surprised Horizon Forbidden West didn't sell as well as expected.</a> Yoshida also talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/" data-ref-id="1100-6528852">why there hasn't been a Bloodborne remaster yet.</a> He left Sony earlier this year <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-announces-retirement-from-sony/1100-6528084/" data-ref-id="1100-6528084">after 30+ years. </a></p>

                <p>Rockstar's 2010 game Red Dead Redemption has been rated for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. The ESRB <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40987/red-dead-redemption/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently posted a rating</a> for the game on these platforms, and this has led some to believe a remaster of the game is in the works and that it could possibly launch soon. Nothing is confirmed, however.</p><p>This is all separate from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">ongoing rumors of Red Dead Redemption II coming to Switch 2 and getting updated versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. The ESRB database has no rating for Red Dead Redemption II on those platforms, however.</p><p>The ESRB rating for Red Dead Redemption mentions zombies, which suggests the possible upcoming re-release could feature the game's popular Undead Nightmare expansion.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption came to the Switch in 2023 and PC in 2024, some 13 and 14 years after the game originally debuted on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010. The follow-up--which is a prequel to the events of the first game--launched in 2018 for PS4 and Xbox One and came to PC in 2019.</p><p>The rumored RDR2 ports for Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S are said to be in the works for a 2025 release, while a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-4-remaster-may-be-in-the-works/1100-6531466/" data-ref-id="1100-6531466">GTA 4 remaster</a> could come out this year as well. Whether or not the rumored new versions of RDR and RDR2 could be packaged together is unknown.</p><p>Rockstar owner Take-Two recently said it had eight new iterations of previously released titles in the works that will be released by the end of its 2028 fiscal year, meaning by March 31, 2028. These will be remasters and ports; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-xbox-switch-2-port-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6536035/" data-ref-id="1100-6536035">only four have been confirmed so far</a>, and some are speculating that the possible re-releases of RDR and RDR2 could be among the announced projects.</p><p>As for Rockstar's biggest upcoming release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 has been delayed yet again</a> and is now set for release in November 2026.</p>

                <p>Sony has announced Horizon Steel Frontiers, a new game for mobile devices and PC under development at Guild Wars studio NCSoft. The new entry in the Horizon franchise is an MMORPG that looks heavily inspired by Capcom's Monster Hunter series--albeit with mechanical monsters instead of organic ones--and the PC version will be playable through NCSoft's Purple platform.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qwAulK6db4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9qwAulK6db4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Developed in collaboration with Horizon studio Guerrilla Games, Horizon Steel Frontiers is set in the Deadlands. As a Machine Hunter, players will get to customize their character and embark on large-scale raids, utilizing an "advanced" combat system to secure resources. A release date has not been revealed yet, and the game isn't listed for PS5 or PS4--a first for the franchise considering its PlayStation roots.</p><p>Recently, Sony took Chinese conglomerate Tencent to court over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/light-of-motiram/">Light of Motiram</a>, a game that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/">Sony labeled as a "slavish clone" of the Horizon series</a>.</p><p>Since the first Horizon game launched in 2017, the series has steadily grown with expansions, a sequel, and spin-off games like Horizon: Call of the Mountain and Lego Horizon Adventures. Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horizon-forbidden-west-sequel-in-development-guerrilla-confirms/1100-6513480/">Guerrilla confirmed that it was working on</a> "Aloy's next adventure" and the studio is also rumored to be developing a multiplayer game that will feature a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-horizon-online-co-op-game-confirmed-in-job-listing/1100-6510122/">completely different art direction</a> when compared to the mainline games.</p><p>Outside of games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-horizon-movie-gets-release-window-update/1100-6535520/">a Horizon live-action movie is also in the works</a>, with filming expected to kick off in 2026.</p>
