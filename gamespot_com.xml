                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

While players continue to pour over the details, they may find a few Easter eggs that were placed in the game by Kojima himself. According to Kojima, he only took that hands-on approach because his staff refused to do it for him.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Spark</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/death-stranding-2s-kojima-related-easter-eggs-were-all-self-inserted-because-his-team-refused-to-humor-him/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>), Kojima confirmed that he personally added those nods to his past. He went on to say that when his staff was asked to include his self-referential jokes, they would pretend they didn't hear him.</p><p>It's possible that Kojima was only joking about his staff's lack of enthusiasm for his ideas, but he did share the details about where one of his Easter eggs is hidden. He noted that it can be found when players visit a hot spring and look up at the sky before zooming in on the stars.</p><p>Later this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-art-book-goes-behinds-the-scenes-on-death-stranding-2-on-the-beachs-development/1100-6532664/" data-ref-id="1100-6532664">The Art of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> will offer an in-depth look at the creation of Kojima's latest game. But we can't say for certain if it will include any references to his Easter eggs.

As of July 22, new guidelines state that the minimum age required to livestream will be raised to 16.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, YouTube allows teens aged 13 and above to stream solo, as is also the case with Twitch. However, the new rules (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/youtube-changes-live-streaming-policy/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a>) will mean that creators will need to be 16 years or older to livestream on the platform. Children between the ages of 13-15 will still be allowed to appear on a livestream but the policy states that they must be "visibly accompanied by an adult" or else their live chat will be disabled and their account "may temporarily lose access to live chat or other features."</p><p dir="ltr">These new measures may impact young creators trying to build an online following without the intrusion of parental supervision, but it's also a sign that YouTube is prioritising online safety for children. The policy is also only regarding livestreaming, so there does not currently appear to be any new age restriction when it comes to posting pre-recorded videos.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">Roblox also placed new restrictions on its youngest users</a> by restricting kids under 13 from accessing unrated experiences or social hangouts, following repeated accusations that the platform was failing to protect children from would-be predators.</p>

Fulghor is one of the toughest Nightlords to beat thanks to his hard-hitting attacks combined with relentless speed. If you're trying to get all of the Remembrances, then you'll already have attempted to beat Fulghor on more than one occasion. To unlock and fight his Everdark Sovereign version, you'll need to have bested him at least once. Beyond that, here's the best way to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, including his weaknesses and our recommended builds.</p><h2 id="Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight_recommended_setup">Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight recommended setup</h2><p>The Darkdrift Knight, and in turn his Everdark Sovereign version, is weak to Lightning damage, but has resistance against Holy damage, as this is the type of damage he deals. You'll want to equip lightning-based relics such as the Dark Knight of Baron, which is acquired by beating the Sovereign Gaping Jaw, last week's Sovereign boss. If you didn't get that relic, choose any that boost Lightning attack power, strength, or dexterity stats.</p><p>On your way to the Sovereign Darkdrift Knight, make sure to interact with the Scale-Bearing Merchant if you come across him. He gives the option to grant resistance to status ailments, enhanced armaments, an additional sacred flask, runes, or improved physique. We chose to take the enhanced armament to increase the chances of getting anything Lightning-based. The best weapon to take to face him is the <strong>Bolt of Granssax</strong>. If you don't come across it, try to find any Lightning weapon. The <strong>Sword of Milos</strong> is also valuable, since it decreases the physical damage output of all bosses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522091"></a><figcaption>Fulghor, Champion of Nightglow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522091-everdark-sovereign-boss.jpg"></figure><h2 id="How_to_beat_the_Everdark_Sovereign_Darkdrift_Knight">How to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight</h2><p>After fighting this boss for several hours, it's safe to say he's not easy to take down. He's certainly harder than Gaping Jaw, but it does depend on your playstyle. As standard, he starts at phase two of his regular boss fight, and will already have his darkened arm that he uses for long-range attacks. He also uses it to slam down and create an area-of-effect (AoE) attack. Dodging this enables you to get some close-range hits in, as he will pause for around three seconds before continuing his assault.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522092"></a><figcaption>Do not stand in the Darkdrift Knight's golden glow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522092-everdark-sovereign-boss%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>When Fulghor is charging an attack, you can stagger him by using heavy attacks. This is crucial to giving you and your teammates a window of opportunity to get some damage in. He will occasionally stampede through the arena using his lance. The golden light that he emits while doing this stampede will explode, so ensure you're not inside it when that happens.</p><p>Breaking the boss is easier with a Colossal weapon, so it's definitely recommended to hit him with heavy attacks as often as possible to enable you and your teammates to get damage in during those phases. This is most efficiently done as either the Raider or Wylder <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-nightreign-classes-and-tier-list/2900-6624/" data-ref-id="2900-6624">Nightreign classes</a>. Ironeye can use marking, which builds more Poise damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4522095"></a><figcaption>When Fulghor points to the sky, run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4522095-everdark-sovereign-boss%282%29.jpg"></figure><p>During his next phase, Fulghor will spawn clouds that rain down arrows, which track you down. This is accompanied by a twinblade attack during which he will leap into the air and spin down to the ground with a slam. He also attacks with a regular bow with tracking arrows. The only way to avoid this is to run away--and fast. He will spin attack three times before concluding with the AoE slam.</p><p>If you see a wind effect on his blade, prepare for a wind attack. He will become faster and use a nuke attack. If he starts running and leaps high into the air, he's preparing to launch an explosive arrow with a massive AoE attack, which tracks. You'll either have to perfect dodge, perfect parry, or sprint away to give yourself more time to dodge it from a distance.</p><p>The most important strategy to beat the Everdark Sovereign Darkdrift Knight is to remember to use your heavy attack. When he starts to aim, this is your crucial window to land heavy hits and break him. Then, your entire party can begin to hit him with as much damage as possible.</p><p>Repeat this process as many times as possible, remembering to prepare to perfect dodge three times when he begins his charge attacks. Though it is tricky timing, it is possible to perfect dodge those consecutive attacks.
