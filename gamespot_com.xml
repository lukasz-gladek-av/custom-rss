                <p>Cash is still the ultimate commodity in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online/" data-ref-id="5000-532553">Grand Theft Auto Online</a>, and Rockstar Games has been known to go out of its way to entice players with in-game currency rewards... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-players-get-1-million-cash-just-for-logging-in-right-now/1100-6534169/" data-ref-id="1100-6534169">sometimes for just logging in</a>.

Just <a href="https://discord.com/invite/rockstargames" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clicking on this link</a> will take you where you need to be.</p><p>If you need something to invest all of that cash in, GTA Online's next update--A Safehouse in the Hills--allows players to buy their own missions. A new trailer for that update dropped today, and it revealed the return of Michael De Santa, one of the leading characters from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v/" data-ref-id="5000-108839">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>. If the footage is any indication, Michael's retirement didn't fully take. Or perhaps he's just very passionate about keeping certain criminal affairs out of his upscale neighborhood.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APJ-lT0sBhg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/APJ-lT0sBhg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To get one of these mega mansions for yourself, players will have to strike a deal with the Prix Luxury Real Estate company, which promises "sprawling grounds, breathtaking views, and first-rate amenities--including the latest in personal assistance and business service technology."</p><p>A Safehouse in the Hills will launch on December 10, and players who opt into a Prix Luxury Black Tier VIP from now through December 7 can grab an Ubermacht Revolter sports car at the Luxury Autos showroom. Players can also advance to the Gold Tier membership by finishing all three New Listings missions, which will reward users with a $1 million bonus of in-game cash, as well as a $2 million discount on one of the luxury estates being offered by Prix Luxury.</p><p>Earlier this fall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">Rockstar added GTA Online</a> to its GTA+ membership service.

                <p>Entertainment giant Disney is hiring someone to join its Digital Entertainment team to work on an upcoming Star Wars game that has the ambitious goal of being a "groundbreaking game experience that will herald the next generation of Disney to the world."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.disneycareers.com/en/job/glendale/associate-art-director-franchise-creative/391/88321654624" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">job ad for an Associate Art Director</a> calls for someone who will work on the "ambitious and exciting new project."</p><p>"Working with top-class industry talent, this role is perfect for the seasoned visionary leader looking to create something epic--guiding and collaborating with a robust group of creative and production leaders focused around a wonderfully rich and cohesive product that is truly Disney," reads a line from the description.</p><p>The successful candidate will be the person who "inspires and informs our development teams to deliver the most authentic world-class Star Wars experiences."</p><p>This person will help "shape the overall visual direction, safeguard IP integrity, and foster creative collaboration across internal and external teams."</p><p>The person who gets the should will review art and visual design submissions with the aim of "ensuring all assets meet our brand and quality standards." The person will also give feedback and should have a "deep understanding of Star Wars lore."</p><p>Naturally, this person will also collaborate with the teams at Lucasfilm.</p><p>The job calls for someone with a lot of experience, including a minimum of seven years in gaming, film, or TV, and someone who has a "broad and deep" understanding of Star Wars. The person should also have "extensive game development experience" on "top-grossing, critically acclaimed AAA games on console and mobile."</p><p>What's more, the person who gets the job will be asked to travel globally to meet with partners spanning the world over.</p><p>The job requisition has lots of details about what the person will do and what credentials they should have, but it does not say much of anything about what the game actually is. From the sound of the job ad, the project will be developed externally, which makes sense given Disney doesn't do much internal game development and instead licenses its brands to external teams.</p><p>While this specific game remains a mystery, we do know about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">many in-development Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse, a remake of Knights of the Old Republic, a new game from Amy Hennig, Star Wars: Zero Company, and a third Star Wars Jedi game at Respawn. The latest rumor is that Creative Assembly is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-truly-special-new-total-war-game-will-be-revealed-at-the-game-awards/1100-6536723/" data-ref-id="1100-6536723">making a Star Wars Total War game and that it may be revealed at The Game Awards.</a></p><p>The frontrunner to become the next Disney CEO, Josh D'Amaro, is a big fan of video games. He shepared the $1.5 billion investment into Epic Games for the upcoming Disney x Fortnite project, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disneys-possible-new-ceo-wants-to-do-more-with-gaming-report/1100-6536640/" data-ref-id="1100-6536640">wants to do more with gaming going forward.</a></p><p>Disney was at one time a bigger player in the world of video games, as the company had its own dedicated internal gaming division with Disney Interactive Studios. Disney also operated the once-popular Disney Infinity "toys-to-life" brand, but it also shuttered. Today, Disney's efforts in gaming mainly involve licensing its brands to other companies. In 2019, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bob-iger-disney-isnt-particularly-good-at-publishing-games-1183088/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Iger spoke candidly about Disney's struggles</a> making and publishing games internally, admitting, "We haven't been particularly good..."</p>

This gun has infinite ammo, and it can also be Pack-a-Punched.</p><p dir="ltr">Completing the map's LGM-1 quest will only reward you with one Wonder Weapon, no matter how many people are in your party.</p><p dir="ltr">To get another LGM-1 Wonder weapon for your party, you'll need to get lucky with the randomness of the Mystery Box or use a Wonderbar GobbleGum. However, the Wonderbar GobbleGum only guarantees your next spin of the Mystery Box will be a Wonder Weapon, but it could give you the Ray Gun instead.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Activate_power_for_the_map">Activate power for the map</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616796" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616796"></a><figcaption>Pack-a-Punch machine</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616796-pap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The game holds your hand for this part, so all you need to do is follow the orange quest markers that guide you through finding the missing components to repair the oculus, and then complete these guided steps to turn on the power and activate the Pack-a-Punch machine.</p><p dir="ltr">Note: During these early steps you'll find purple Aether crystals around the map. <strong>Do not shoot these yet</strong>.

Shoot the purple Aether crystals that spawn randomly all around the map. You need to be using the gun with Cryo Freeze, and this will cause the crystals to drop an Absolute Zero fragment part.</p><p dir="ltr">Shoot three different crystals and <strong>collect the Absolute Zero fragment parts</strong> for each. You also want to <strong>avoid shooting any additional crystals</strong> on the map, as you might need more fragments if you fail a later step.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Wiring_part">Wiring part</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616798" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616798"></a><figcaption>Outdoor light blinking in my match</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616798-blinkinglightexample.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You also need to collect wires. This is done by shooting a blinking outdoor light, and an example of one is shown in the image above.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of outdoor lights, but only one light blinking each match. The blinking is very noticeable, so just walk around the exterior of the map until you find it.

Oscar starts spawning into your rounds after you've unlocked Pack-a-Punch. This robot will have little flying drones hovering above and trying to protect him. Shoot and destroy one of the drones and <strong>pick up the Damaged Drone</strong> part it drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Also, don't waste your bullets trying to kill Oscar in this step. This is a boss you need to keep around and use for the steps below.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Oscar_trap_trials">Oscar trap trials</h2><p dir="ltr">There are three trials you need to do involving traps and Oscar. Again, don't waste your ammo trying to kill Oscar, but instead, you want to lure him to one of the three trap areas on the map to complete a trial.</p><p dir="ltr">These trials are best attempted at the end of the round when you only have one or two zombies left. This keeps you from getting overwhelmed with enemies. They can also be completed in any order, but you will need to have collected all parts mentioned above. Oscar will <strong>drop the LGM-1 Wonder Weapon reward</strong> after he's defeated in the last trial you complete.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Luminarium_trap">Luminarium trap</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616801" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616801"></a><figcaption>Battery Overcharge step in Luminarium</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616801-oscaroverchargemeter.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lure Oscar to the Observatory's Luminarium and interact with the trap inside the room to place the Battery part. Now you need to survive in the room, while keeping Oscar nearby.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a meter that appears on your screen for a Battery Overcharge. Keep Oscar close to the trap until the meter is full. You also want to make sure you're destroying the drones that protect him, as they make him invulnerable to the traps.</p><p dir="ltr">If he's invulnerable with drones when the Overcharge meter fills, you'll fail the step and need to repeat it on the next round.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Observatory_Dome_trap">Observatory Dome trap</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616803" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616803"></a><figcaption>Steam valve</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616803-steamvalve.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Head to the Observatory Dome (Pack-a-Punch) room. Oscar doesn't need to be inside the room for the first part of this step, so if you have a teammate, get them to lead Oscar and zombies away while you search for a broken steam valve.</p><p dir="ltr">The valve can spawn all around the inside of the Pack-a-Punch room, and you can hear an audible hiss when you're close. Find it, shoot it, and another valve will appear. Repeat this process of shooting the steam valves until you have done this for five valves. Make sure you're looking on the lower level and the upper level above you. Once all five are successfully shot, you'll get an audio cue.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616804" data-ratio="0.56265432098765" data-width="3240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616804"></a><figcaption>Align the sun with the telescope trap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616804-alignthesun.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, you need to bring Oscar close to the Pack-a-Punch machine before you interact with the telescope trap across from it. When you interact with the trap, it will change your view to the viewfinder of the telescope, and you're looking up at the sky. You need to adjust the telescope to align with the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of your view from the telescope is just pink and purple colors in space, but move it until you see the sun. The sun seems to be positioned the same in every match, so move the viewfinder up and to the right. You'll see a yellow glowing orb, and that's the sun.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you line up the sun, you're kicked out of the telescope view, and Oscar should be close enough to zap with the sun beam that shoots down inside the room. Again, this is the area directly in front of Pack-a-Punch, and the beam is going to be centered in between the PaP and the trap.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Museum_Infinitum___Absolute_Zero_fragments">Museum Infinitum - Absolute Zero fragments</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4616805"></a><figcaption>Rocket trap activated</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4616805-rockettrap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lead Oscar to the Museum Infinitum room with the rocket trap. You need to get Oscar really close to the back of the trap, and then quickly interact with the trap controls to blast Oscar with the rockets. This is a much faster process than the Luminarium step, but you also have to time it correctly, because the rockets will only blast for a few seconds.</p><p dir="ltr">This can be difficult solo, but with additional teammates, you can have one person at the controls while another baits Oscar to the trap.</p><p dir="ltr">If you fail this step, then you'll need to go collect three more fragments from the purple Aether Crystals and try again.</p><p dir="ltr">Once all three trials are complete, Oscar will drop the LGM-1 Wonder Weapon for you to pick up.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is intended as both a continuation and a new start for the long dormant franchise. Though Nintendo has never quite said it overtly, it has seemed likely that this is meant to launch a new series of Prime games--possibly even a second trilogy, for the sake of dramatic rhyme. And the ending of Prime 4 accents that feeling, leaving the door wide open for more story--but in the process, diminishing the character of protagonist Samus Aran.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond follow.</strong></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As many eager Metroid fans know from preview coverage and reviews, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond features a wide cast of Federation characters, who have been stranded on Viewros with Samus. As you explore the corners of Sol Valley you eventually meet five in total: engineer Myles MacKenzie, sniper Reger Tokabi, Sergeant Ezra Duke, Private Nora Armstrong, and mech unit VUE-995. Each talks with Samus and relates to her in different ways. Myles is out of his element and needs Samus' rescue. Armstrong is a bona fide Samus superfan. Tokabi opens up to her about his religion and upbringing.</p><p dir="ltr">Your mileage may vary on how much you care about these characters--in my review I said they're mostly broad military archetypes--but it's clear that the game <em>wants</em> you to care about them. They're functionally your crew. They all stay back at base camp and help you out in different ways. When the time comes to break into the Lamorn's shielded tower, all of you go together. Your mission to reactivate the Master Teleporter is to open a way back home. The unspoken element of this is that you're trying to save them, too. They're all stranded far from home just like you are.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, as you start to activate the Master Teleporter, Sylux chooses that moment to attack. A major portion of the final battle involves fighting alongside all five of the Federation squad at once, providing emergency help when they're downed, and taking down Sylux's shields so that they can all concentrate fire on him. But just when it seems he's beaten and you can all go home, he reemerges. The teleporter is damaged and can only hold out so long, and it can only work if Samus is the one operating it. Sylux is dead-set on attacking Samus to the exclusion of all the others, and if she gets hurt, the teleporter won't have an operator. So in a moment of selfless heroism, they each grab onto Sylux, stalling him just long enough, as they tell Samus to escape. At the height of the dramatic tension, you have to press A to teleport, leaving your comrades behind as they cling to Sylux to protect you.</p><p dir="ltr">That is: The five <em>Federation</em> characters act selflessly and heroically, while Samus saves herself.</p><p dir="ltr">Now to be fair, the stakes of the moment make it clear Samus has no choice. In fact, if you abstain from activating the teleporter, you simply die and need to start one phase of the boss battle over again. So Samus is not actually being selfish, but she's not exactly being heroic either. This is living legend Samus Aran--her reputation precedes her. All of these characters knew who she was and implicitly trusted her. Throughout this campaign and many others, we've seen her do the impossible. So at this moment, it's just hard to buy the dramatic conceit that she couldn't have figured out any other way than to leave her comrades behind.</p><p dir="ltr">If Prime 4's ending is intended as the starting point for a new series, it immediately raises questions about what comes next. Sylux is still out there, albeit seemingly marooned on a dying planet without any way to escape. Sylux is still in command of the Metroids, and still presumably has the loyalty of his loose assemblage of space pirates. Your five Federation companions are there with him--he either killed them immediately after you escaped, or, more optimistically, they got away and went back to base camp. Except now the Master Teleporter has no operator and they have no viable path off-planet.</p><p dir="ltr">So what happens now? Will the entire series focus on this war with Sylux? Is Samus going back to Viewros to rescue her companions? Does she even know where Viewros is, or is it just one of billions of uncharted planets in the furthest reaches of space? The brief moment that we see a starmap strongly suggests the latter. But the ending as a whole leaves us with almost no clarity as to where Samus's story might be headed after Prime 4, and gives this revival a listless quality. As a result of the lack of any propulsive force toward the next chapter, we're left lingering with this final, unflattering impression of the great Samus Aran.</p><p dir="ltr">We do see a somber and genuinely affecting moment where Samus honors her comrades. But that doesn't offer much clue as to what the future holds. For the time being, it's a downer. The triumphant return of the Metroid Prime series left us with Samus failing to protect people who were depending on her, and with a small band of new characters getting the heroic climax. Regardless of how you feel about the characters themselves, I was left feeling like Samus had been pushed out of the spotlight in her own series.</p><p dir="ltr">When you're in the final area accompanied by your companions, you can talk to them each individually before proceeding to the final battle. They all make comments aligned with their personalities. Some are funny, others are more reflective. VUE apologizes for wrecking Betsy, the massive mech that you used to punch a hole through the forcefield. Tokabi remarks that this place feels sacred. As you move your way through, the troops start to talk about finding the teleporter, and how eager they are to leave. Armstrong, the enthusiastic private who has looked up to Samus since they first met, says just one thing: "Finally, we get to go home."</p><p dir="ltr">I'm sorry Armstrong, but no we don't. Not all of us. Not yet.</p>
