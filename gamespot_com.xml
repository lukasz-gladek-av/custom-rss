                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's upcoming 11.2 update is bringing with it one unexpected addition popularized by From Software RPGs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dark-souls/" data-ref-id="5000-83346">Dark Souls</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a>--asynchronous social features.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-ghosts-of-karesh-update-is-the-tbc-sequel-we-didnt-know-we-needed/1100-6532500/" data-ref-id="1100-6532500">Ghosts of K'aresh update</a>, Blizzard will add new social functions to Delves, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">MMORPG's latest endgame mode that can be played solo or with small groups</a>. Like in Elden Ring or Dark Souls, players within a Delve will be able to see remnants of other players who have journeyed to the instance, see markers where a player may have died from a strong pack of enemies or hidden trap, and leave helpful messages for others to read while inside. I'm sure these messages will always be 100% serious.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an addition players may not have known they wanted, but one that makes perfect sense and should make Delves feel more alive than they currently do. WoW is a MMO, after all, even as it continues to offer new ways to achieve endgame goals entirely solo. Adding asynchronous social elements to the game's main endgame mode for solo players helps to further reinforce the idea that WoW is a game played alongside millions of other players, even for those players who largely stick to themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders said in an interview with GameSpot it's important that players are able to progress at their own pace in Delves and play with the group size that they want, whether that be solo or with a few friends. The new asynchronous social features in Delves are there to support that flexibility, as Blizzard believes the mode has been a huge success and doesn't want to change what's working.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a way of getting back to some of MMO's roots," Sanders said. "Of knowing that other players are around you, in a way, without necessarily grouping players up with other players they might not want to play withâ€¦This is a way of capturing some of that magic of MMOs, of seeing other players throughout the environment, seeing memories of where they may have messed up and gotten splattered by a trap or something, without necessarily impacting what we think has been really positive and successful about the feature."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Delve social features are just the tip of the iceberg for the Ghosts of K'aresh update, which in many ways serves as a sequel of sorts to events and lore first introduced in the game's The Burning Crusade expansion. It will transport players to the shattered homeworld of the Ethereals to stop a cosmic-level threat from returning. Along the way players will unlock a legendary cloak that can be used to transform into an energy form in order to access new content.</p><p>Blizzard hasn't revealed when the Ghosts of K'aresh update will be going live, but it's expected to be available on WoW's public test realm in the near future. Meanwhile, players are still waiting for more details on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">WoW's upcoming player housing system</a>, which we said already feels full of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/">endless possibilities based on a recent hands-on preview</a>.</p>

                <p>Blizzard has lifted the veil on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next major update, and it's a surprising sequel to the MMORPG's first expansion, as players journey to the shattered homeworld of the mysterious Ethereals.</p><p dir="ltr">Update 11.2, Ghosts of K'aresh, brings to mind the Legion expansion's Shadows of Argus update, which also took players to a destroyed planet that has long existed in the lore. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will travel to the Ethereal former home in an effort to stop the resurrection of Dimensius, a powerful void-lord responsible for the destruction of K'aresh and who players may remember dispatching a fragment of as part of a lengthy quest chain in The Burning Crusade back in 2007. Turns out Dimensius wasn't defeated for good and is back in 11.2 with a major glow-up, sounding and looking far more like a world-destroying entity compared to their <a href="https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Dimensius_the_All-Devouring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original oversized voidwalker look</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Ethereals, strange energy beings who could be found throughout TBC's continent of Outland, have gone on to be a fan-favorite group within WoW's fantasy universe since their introduction close to two decades ago. More recently in The War Within, the Ethereals have had a larger role to play in the MMO's ongoing story of Xal'atath and her powerful void-infused artifact, the Dark Heart. Speaking with GameSpot, associate art director Tina Wang said the team enjoyed looking back at how the Ethereals have been represented in the past in order to inform the look and feel of Ghosts of K'aresh.</p><p dir="ltr">"We really love the old themes from Burning Crusade, the key Ethereal elements, the mana forges, the Eco-Domes, the glowing pink pipes," Wang said. "I think folks who remember and look back at the Ethereals fondly will see a lot of elements that they really connect with."</p><p dir="ltr">To help navigate K'aresh, players will gain a new upgradeable artifact cloak, the Reshii Wraps, that will allow players to "phase dive" into an energy form similar to that of the Ethereals. This lets players see the world through a new lens and will allow access to new activities on K'aresh like Warrants, where players will help track down special enemies for lucrative rewards. The Reshii Wraps will also be used for unique mechanics within the update's new endgame content. One example of using the Reshii Wraps given by lead encounter designer Taylor Sanders is how players in the new raid, Manaforge: Omega, will need to swap to their energy form in order to dodge a giant laser that could wipe out the group.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000" data-ratio="0.56239870340357" data-width="1851" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516000"></a><figcaption>The Reshii Wraps will allow players to phase dive into an energy form to complete new activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516000-wowghostsofkareshreshiiwraps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Another major open-world activity coming as part of the update is called Ecological Succession. Players may remember the large Eco-Domes in TBC's Netherstorm region that helped to define the zone's look, where the Ethereals looked to create new, enclosed ecosystems amidst a backdrop of destruction. In Ghosts of K'aresh, players will get to go hands on and help manage their own Eco-Dome by partnering with the Broker Ve'nari, who will ask for players to retrieve plants and animals from older WoW zones to bring back to the Eco-Domes in an effort to kickstart life once more. It's part of the WoW's team's efforts to take advantage of the huge amount of content already within the MMO, Wang said.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant lead quest designer Stephanie Yoon said progressing Ecological Succession and its storyline will take multiple weeks. It's a slow burn at first, Yoon said, as ecological change doesn't happen overnight. Over time, however, as players introduce new life and meet new characters, the Eco-Dome will change and the fruits of players' labors will become more obvious.</p><p dir="ltr">"When I first saw the end of Ecological Succession, I teared up," Yoon said. "So I hope it impacts players as much as it did me."</p><p dir="ltr">A new zone isn't complete without a new raid and dungeon, and 11.2 will have those too. The Manageforge: Omega raid will see players confronting Dimensius, who Blizzard described as the biggest raid boss in WoW history. How big, exactly? According to Blizzard, the new version of Dimensius is equivalent to the size of Stormwind itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"Players will be fighting against this void-lord, this being the size of Stormwind city, and they'll see him from different perspectives," Sanders said. "They'll be diving from thousands of feet away against lasers and thrown planets, and they'll also be fighting him up close and personal as he's smashing his fists down on the platform next to you that are the size of a school bus. It's going to be an epic encounter."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4516002"></a><figcaption>Ghosts of K'aresh's pink Eco-Domes will be a familiar site to those who played The Burning Crusade.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4516002-wowghostsofkareshecodomes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On the dungeon front, Eco-Dome Al'dani is a new three-boss instance, one where the dungeon's story will actually take place canonically after the events of the raid and dive into how the Ethereals are looking to sustain life on their home planet. For the more solo-minded players, there's a new Delve as well, one that will actually return adventurers to the Azure Vault in the Dragon Isles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wows-next-major-update-will-add-one-of-dark-souls-most-innovative-features/1100-6532496/" data-ref-id="1100-6532496">Delves are additionally receiving new souls-like social functions</a> like player ghosts, death markers, and the ability to leave messages for other Delvers to see.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that the update is all about the Ethereals and the Brokers, the Shadowlands mega-dungeon Tazavesh, the Veiled Market will return for The War Within Season 3's Mythic+ dungeon pool, split into two instances. Tazavesh will be joined by the new Eco-Dome Al'dani as well as Halls of Atonement from Shadowlands and four War Within instances. On the PvP side of the season, K'aresh itself will have a specific PvP zone, Vanquisher's Wake, earmarked for open-world PvP where players will be able to complete their weekly spark quest to earn rewards.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard hasn't yet revealed when WoW's Ghosts of K'aresh update will release, but it will likely be available for testing on the game's public test realm in the near future. As for what else is coming to WoW in 2025, Blizzard previously announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">Legion Remix event for later in the year</a>, and players are hoping to see more of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">WoW's player housing system</a> as well. In a recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-tried-wow-player-housing-and-the-possibilities-already-feel-endless/1100-6531566/" data-ref-id="1100-6531566">WoW player housing hands-on preview</a>, we said even in their currently early form, the possibilities offered by the game's housing decoration tools already feel endless.</p>

<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_4_Reloaded">What to expect from Season 4 Reloaded</h2><h3 id="Two_new_weapons">Two new weapons</h3><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded adds two new weapons to Black Ops 6 and Warzone. Activision announced the Olympia, a double-barrel shotgun, and the pickaxe melee weapon will arrive sometime during this midseason update.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517092"></a><figcaption>Pickaxe melee weapon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517092-pickaxeweapon.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Two_new_events">Two new events</h3><p dir="ltr">Each seasonal update usually includes a few events. So far, the only ones confirmed for Season 4 Reloaded are two community-based Zombies events. These are vaguely described by Activision, so it's not yet clear how these event or reward systems work.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>King of the Dead</strong> runs from June 26 to July 3. For this, players must eliminate zombies in any Zombie mode to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Master of Grief</strong> runs from July 10-17. This event is described as collecting Essence in Grief in order to earn points to climb a leaderboard.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6">Black Ops 6</h3><h4 id="More_multiplayer_maps">More multiplayer maps</h4><p dir="ltr">For Black Ops 6 multiplayer, the Season 4 Reloaded adds two more maps: A brand-new map called Eclipse and a remaster of Fringe from Black Ops 3.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517103"></a><figcaption>Eclipse multiplayer map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517103-bo6-season-04-announcement-009.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision recently confirmed that next season will bring the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/">final Zombies map for Black Ops 6</a>. This means players won't get a new map for the midseason update, but there will be new limited-time modes for Zombies.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="New_Zombies_LTMs">New Zombies LTMs</h4><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Starting Room LTM</strong> is inspired by the starting room of the classic Moon map from Black Ops 1, where players are limited to only a small section of the map. This mode will be available on all Black Ops 6 maps, with each one giving a limited area for players to survive as long as they can.</p><p dir="ltr">The <strong>Abomination Challenge LTM</strong> is vaguely described by Activision as taking place on "a warped version of Liberty Falls" and players must hunt down and eliminate an ultra-powered-up Abomination.</p><p dir="ltr">Grief mode launched at the start of Season 4, and Treyarch confirmed the mode is permanent. The latest patch notes for Black Ops 6 included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-update-improves-grief-mode-and-returns-disabled-skin/1100-6532410/">several improvements to Grief</a>, and the developer revealed more updates are currently in testing, so it's likely Season 4 Reloaded could include even more quality-of-life changes the mode.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h3><h4 id="More_Ranked_Play">More Ranked Play</h4><p dir="ltr">Season 4 Reloaded returns Resurgence Ranked Play to Rebirth Island. The competitive mode will exist alongside Ranked Play on Verdansk and feature a separate ranking system and rewards, so players can progress through both ladders.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4517185"></a><figcaption>Resurgence Ranked Play on Rebirth Island</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4517185-bo6-season-04-announcement-058.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to sweaty Ranked Play modes, Season 4 Reloaded includes the Havoc Royale LTM and Resurgence Casual.</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Additional_game_modes">Additional game modes</h4><p dir="ltr">The Havoc Royale limited-time mode is described as chaotic 15-minute matches with 44 players on a limited section of Verdansk. Each circle collapse will include a different game modifier to affect the match, and players will need to adapt fast to survive.</p><p dir="ltr">With the success of casual BR modes on Verdansk, Season 4 Reloaded adds the Resurgence Casual mode, bringing bots to Rebirth Island. This mode will still follow the normal Resurgence gameplay, but the lobby is made up of a mix of real players and bots.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The publisher has also confirmed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-podcast-confirms-black-ops-7-is-boots-on-the-ground/1100-6532517/" data-ref-id="1100-6532517">Black Ops 7 is a boots-on-the-ground game</a>, squashing the rumors of potential jetpack or wall-running mechanics.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Dotemu has been at the forefront of a revolution in retro-style 2D throwbacks as of late. Recent hits include updates to classic franchises like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Metal Slug Tactics, and Streets of Rage 4, while the company's porting pedigree also includes the Final Fantasy franchise, as well as multiple Neo Geo titles.</p><p dir="ltr">The publisher is double-dipping into nostalgia in 2025, first with Ninja Gaiden Ragebound, and then with Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest collaboration between Dotemu and Tribute Games. After getting some hands-on time with the new sidescrolling arcade superhero beat-'em-up at Summer Game Fest 2025, the evolution of what the two companies built in Shredder's Revenge so far seems worthy of the superhero names it includes.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | She-Hulk &amp; Rocket Raccoon Character Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">My demo began with me selecting two heroes from a group of seven available choices: Captain America, Nova, Storm, Venom, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Phyla-Vell. The seven heroes have distinct movesets and abilities--which is a step forward from Shredder's Revenge, where outside of little nuances, each Ninja Turtle you could control functioned essentially the same way.</p><p dir="ltr">From there, I took my dynamic duo into the streets of New York, where I immediately began facing off against the hordes working for villain Annihilus. You control one hero at a time and can swap them at will. Each hero has multiple attacks, ranging from quick jabs to slow but powerful strikes, as well as an arsenal of moves they can execute in the air. You can also combine attack buttons for a super attack, at the cost of some health--which is a mechanic steeped in 2D beat-'em-up history that I absolutely appreciated seeing here again.</p><p dir="ltr">Choosing the right combination of heroes in Marvel Cosmic Invasion seems like it's going to be very important, especially because of the previously-mentioned distinct attributes. Nova, for example, thrives on long-distance combat thanks to his energy wave attacks, while Wolverine prefers to be up close and personal with his claws and powerful throw attack. You can also switch between your two heroes on the fly, which allowed me to tailor my offensive strategy to the situation I was currently facing--if my enemies had ranged attacks, I needed to switch to my long-range attacker, for example.</p><p dir="ltr">This adds an extra layer of strategy to each encounter that helps the entire experience drift away from "mindless button-mashing" to a more measured approach, which benefits the game overall. It also allows for tactical decisions--if my inactive character was really low on health, I could instead call them in as an assist for a single attack, which gave me breathing room during a particularly hectic battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4516633-marvel_cosmic_invasion_screenshot_5.png"

dir="ltr">Fighting enemies looks, sounds, and feels great, with each individual strike making a satisfying "thud" when it connects with an unlucky enemy. The super attacks are particularly flashy, filling the screen with effects as every enemy on the screen is wiped out--I like Storm's electricity the most, as it reminds me of her super move in the Marvel vs. Capcom series, but every hero's super attack has a dash of flair to it.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo also featured two boss battles, one against the villain Beetle under the influence of one of Annihilus's thralls, and one featuring Taskmaster just being his normal Taskmaster self. Both boss fights followed the classic 2D beat-'em-up boss fight formula--battles that played out in stages, with a giant health bar at the bottom, and the boss using powerful moves for big damage--and both offered a nice challenge at the end of each stage.</p><p dir="ltr">However, I did notice one extra wrinkle in each boss battle: each boss's health bar had a blue frame around it, which I had to remove with attacks before the red health bar would decrease. This represented a sort of "shield" that prevented me from dealing direct damage, and which would occasionally refill at different parts of the fight. The shield mechanic added a bit more difficulty to the battle--even if that difficulty only amounted to a few extra seconds' worth of attacks--but I'm now interested to see how Tribute will continue to iterate on the standard boss battle formula in the full release.</p><p dir="ltr">My time with Marvel Cosmic Invasion went exactly how I expected it to go: I beat up a bunch of enemies, fought some cool bosses, and bathed in a wave of 2D nostalgia thanks to Tribute Games's talent for recreating the arcade feelings of old. While there are a few new elements at play here--more varied character abilities, extra elements in boss battles, and so on--this still feels like a game I would have played and loved in my childhood. Getting that nostalgic feeling right is what will make Marvel Cosmic Invasion a hit when it finally launches, and so far, Tribute has nailed it.</p><p dir="ltr">Marvel Cosmic Invasion is scheduled to release later this year on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
