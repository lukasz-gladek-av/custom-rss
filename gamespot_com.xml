                <p>Former WWE wrestler Dave Bautista has made a name for himself as an actor over the last decade, but now he's moving into the video game space as a producer. Bautista and Titan1Studios have agreed to partner up to bring Cat Assassin to life as a new media franchise including an upcoming video game.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://gamerant.com/cat-assassin-game-dave-bautista-stray-neo-noir-franchise-exclusive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, Cat Assassin was created by Steve Lerner, the writer of the critically acclaimed indie game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stray-review-nine-lives/1900-6417917/" data-ref-id="1900-6417917">Stray</a>. While that title put players in control of an adorable cat in a city of robots, Cat Assassin's lead character, Hugh, is considerably less cuddly. He's described as "a skilled assassin navigating a chaotic world of warring cartels and corrupt power players." Presumably that's a role that Bautista may be interested in playing, but the announcement doesn't specify his involvement as an actor.</p><p>Cat Assassin takes place in a "neo-noir city populated by anthropomorphic felines." The video game is being planned as a stealth-action game with dark humor. The announcement notes that the Cat Assassin game is inspired by Assassin's Creed, Splinter Cell, and Sifu.</p><p>Bautista's Dogbone Entertainment production company is also developing Cat Assassin as a potential animated series and a feature film. Further details about their plans for the franchise and the upcoming game aren't currently known.</p><p>After wrapping his decade plus as Drax the Destroyer in the MCU, Bautista has expressed his interest in starring as Marcus Fenix in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dave-bautista-really-wants-to-play-the-lead-in-netflixs-gears-of-war-movie/1100-6509125/" data-ref-id="1100-6509125">Gears of War</a> movie in development at Netflix.</p>
