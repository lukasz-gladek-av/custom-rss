                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-4/">Fallout 4</a> arrived nearly a decade ago, and it's anyone's guess when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a> will be released. Thankfully, the fan developers  at Team Folon took it upon themselves to create <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/" data-ref-id="1100-6525518">Fallout London</a>, an unofficial Fallout 4 mod that gives players a glimpse of the post-apocalypse in the United Kingdom. Now, Team Folon plans to go even further with an upcoming DLC release for Fallout London.</p><p>"What started as a simple hotfix has grown into something much bigger," said the team on the Fallout London Discord. "Given the scope of this update, we're aware it may make changes that impact save files, so rather than risking breaking things for a small update, we're looking to roll this into a part of our very first DLC!"</p><p>Specific details about the release date and what will be in the DLC weren't disclosed, but it was said to include new content as well as things that were cut from the original release of the mod. Additionally, Team Folon announced that it's no longer just a collective of fans, and the company is now incorporated as an official business. The team suggested that it may work on "a small indie game," but promised to "always continue to support Fallout London."</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-london-just-set-a-record-on-gog/1100-6525741/" data-ref-id="1100-6525741">Fallout London was downloaded 500,000 times</a> in the first 24 hours, which is a record for the GOG store. <a href="https://fallout4london.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fallout London still has its own page</a> outside of Discord, where more information about the mod can be found. Meanwhile, a separate team is working on another ambitious and unofficial Fallout 4 mod. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-nuevos-mexico-mod-trailer-brings-the-post-apocalypse-south-of-the-border/1100-6526953/" data-ref-id="1100-6526953">Fallout: Nuevos Mexico</a> doesn't currently have a release window, but it will explore what's happening in Mexico during the events of the Fallout games.</p>
