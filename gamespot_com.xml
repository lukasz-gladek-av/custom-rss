                <p dir="ltr">Launched in 2017, Xbox Game Pass is something of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/">paradigm shift</a> in the world of video games. For a monthly fee, members get access to a collection of games--including new releases from Microsoft--and as long as they stay subscribed, they can play those games as much as they want. That is, unless a title leaves the Game Pass catalog--and that's a regular occurrence, especially for titles from third-party companies. Whereas Microsoft's own games rarely get removed from Game Pass, third-party games regularly rotate out of the catalog.</p><p dir="ltr">But why does Game Pass lose games? After <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-9-games-are-leaving-game-pass-very-soon/2900-6267/">17 games were removed from the Game Pass library in February 2025</a>, some might be wondering why.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>No set reason</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There is no one set reason, and when Microsoft announces games that are joining Game Pass, it never says how long they'll stick around for. But the most common explanation is the same rationale for titles leaving Netflix or any other subscription service: a developer/publisher signed a contract with Microsoft for a set period of time, like one year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-removing-these-seven-games-very-soon/2900-5931/#1">which was the case for Persona 5 Tactica</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has stressed that the company makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">all kinds of different deals to get companies to bring their games to Game Pass</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Another reason a game might be removed from Game Pass is due to licensing. Many games feature licensed music or other forms of licensed content. Those licenses have terms, and to adhere to them, sometimes a game gets removed or updated. The Xbox-exclusive game Quantum Break was removed from Game Pass temporarily due to licenses that needed to be renewed, some may recall, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quantum-break-temporarily-removed-from-xbox-game-pass-but-its-coming-back/1100-6512949/">but it eventually came back.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Games may also be removed from the Game Pass library for other reasons, like a business choice to delist an older game in a given series. Microsoft's own Forza Horizon 4, for example, was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting" rel="nofollow ">delisted in 2024 and thus also removed from the Game Pass library</a>. Everyone who already had the game via Game Pass before the delisting received a code to download the full game to keep playing. But anyone who wanted to jump into the game for the first time via Game Pass is out of luck. Why would Microsoft do this? For Forza Horizon 4, Microsoft said it <a href="https://support.forzamotorsport.net/hc/en-us/articles/30662484986387-Forza-Horizon-4-Delisting-FAQ" rel="nofollow ">came down to</a> "agreements with licensing and other partnerships ending." That's as specific as Microsoft got. It's a disappointing situation, for sure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892" data-ratio="0.58244365361803" data-width="843" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453892"></a><figcaption>Game Pass is a major differentiator for Microsoft in the console market.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453892-screenshot2025-03-04at2.46.20pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to business choices and licensing or contract situations, sometimes annualized sports games get replaced by a newer entry in a given series. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/">For example, Madden NFL 23 left Game Pass in February 2025, but EA added Madden NFL 25</a>--the newest game in the series--just before the Super Bowl this year. For what it's worth, Madden NFL 24 is also still available on Game Pass.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Multiple tiers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In addition to getting more expensive, Game Pass has become more convoluted in recent years with the addition of multiple tiers of the service. The original promise of Game Pass was that signing up for the service gave members access to all of Microsoft's first-party games at launch, plus a growing catalog of titles from other companies. That is no longer true.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, people have to subscribe to the most expensive tier of Game Pass on console, Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month), to get day-one titles and the biggest library of games, plus streaming support and access to the EA Play catalog. PC Game Pass offers similar benefits for $12/month. The Game Pass Standard membership ($15/month) on console comes with hundreds of games, but no day-one new releases; Game Pass Core ($10/month) includes a library of 25+ titles but no day-one launches.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Pass Standard and Core libraries are steadier than Game Pass Ultimate, but they, too, have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/">titles that get removed every once in a while</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A silver lining</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're playing and enjoying a game in the Game Pass library and suddenly it gets removed, that may be annoying or frustrating. But there is a small silver lining: All Game Pass members can save 20% on digital content, including full games, so players can buy a game outright to keep playing.</p><p dir="ltr">A game also doesn't normally get removed from Game Pass without warning. Microsoft publishes the lists of games set for removal to its blog twice per month, with removals normally occurring in the middle of the month and at the end, giving you about two weeks to finish up. Game Pass members can also navigate to the "leaving soon" tab on Game Pass to find out what's leaving soon. That's only so helpful if you're in the middle of an RPG that's dozens of hours long, though.</p><p dir="ltr">And of course, more games are added to Game Pass each month. Having something new to play is part of the appeal of Game Pass, and the service definitely delivers in that respect.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Deals with developers</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Spencer told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> that Microsoft makes Game Pass deals "based on the developer's need." One example, he said, is that a developer might agree to launch a new game into Game Pass in exchange for a specific dollar amount payment. In other cases, Microsoft might fund the entire production of a game in exchange for an agreement to have the game launch day one on Xbox Game Pass. Another possibility is just a simple money deal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes the developer's more done with the game and it's more just a transaction of, 'Hey, we'll put it in Game Pass if you'll pay us this amount of money,'" Spencer said. Still other potential arrangements include payments based on usage or spend, Spencer said.</p><p>A spokesperson for Microsoft echoed Spencer's comments, telling GameSpot that because every game is unique, the company works closely with developers to structure a "custom program" that factors in what a given developer/publisher needs, while ensuring they are "compensated financially for their participation in the service."</p><p>"While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving," Microsoft said.</p><p>Indeed, that's set to happen again soon, when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-six-more-games-very-soon/2900-6296/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6296">Enter the Gungeon returns to Game Pass on March 11</a>. The Devolver Digital-published game originally left Game Pass in 2022. Devolver was<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836"> among the first high-profile critics of Game Pass.</a></p><p>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V is arguably the biggest Game Pass title ever, and it's bounced in and out of the service over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-whats-leaving-game-pass-soon-including-gta-5-again/1100-6520096/" data-ref-id="1100-6520096">most recently leaving for a second time in January 2024.</a> Rockstar parent company Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">launching a new game into Game Pass makes no financial sense</a>, but it can be a reasonable business possibility for older titles, like GTA 5.</p><p>Here is Microsoft's full statement regarding why Game Pass titles may exit the catalog:</p><p>"Each game is unique, so we work closely with creators to build a custom program to reflect what they need, ensure they are compensated financially for their participation in the service, and allow room for creativity and innovation. While there is not a set length of time for each game, we work closely with developers to determine a length of time that works for them and allows the Game Pass community to discover and play games. Sometimes, that means that games even make a return to Game Pass after leaving."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>You don't own anything anyway</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The term "ownership" takes on new meaning in a digital context. If you buy a digital game outright or subscribe to Game Pass, you're not taking ownership of anything in the traditional sense. You are, instead, essentially renting access to games. It seems unlikely, but Microsoft could stop offering Game Pass tomorrow, as an example.</p><p dir="ltr">The state of California is making things official with its new law, AB2426, which mandates that digital storefronts inform customers they are acquiring a license to use these products rather than actual ownership. The juggernaut PC platform Steam <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-now-makes-it-clearer-what-youre-really-buying/1100-6527127/">updated its storefront in 2024</a> to inform people that "a purchase of a digital product grants a license of the product on Steam." It remains to be seen if the digital stores for Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo will be updated as well with similar language.</p>

                <p>PlayStation has conducted another round of layoffs, this time impacting the Visual Arts team as well its Malaysian studios.</p><p>Several now-former employees of PlayStation have taken to LinkedIn to share that they've been let go. The roles include lighting, material, environmental, and animation artists. A Naughty Dog alumnus, who's now at Nvidia, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7302878891545620481/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said that those laid off</a> were integral to the development of Uncharted and The Last of Us.</p><p>One of them was a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-sony-cutting-jobs-at-visual-arts-and-malaysia-support-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">senior project manager in Malaysia</a> who worked on Concord and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered. He said, "It was a tough start of the week for us at PlayStation Studios - Visual Arts. There was a wave of workforce reduction and unfortunately I'm no longer part of the brand."</p><p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-studios-visual-arts-layoffs-cuts-last-us-1851767734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, those impacted were working on recently canceled projects such as the one from Days Gone developer Bend Studio. However, the cuts reportedly reached further than that and affected those who also worked on internal art and technical support for PlayStation's first-party studios.</p><p>PlayStation cut <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cutting-900-jobs-in-video-game-industrys-latest-round-of-big-cuts/1100-6521383/" data-ref-id="1100-6521383">900 jobs last year, as well as closed its London Studio.</a> Over the last several years, PlayStation greenlit a live-service initiative that seemingly hasn't gone as well as planned.
