                <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is a unique game that combines the best aspects of the first two titles in the series to create something entirely new. It met with positive reviews when it first launched on PC and mobile in 2016, and now it’s gearing up for a physical release on Switch that is available to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder</a> ahead of its April 24 release. Preordering at Amazon locks in its price guarantee, so if the game is discounted ahead of launch, you’ll pay the lower price. You also won’t be charged until the game is shipped.</p><h2>Rollercoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>There are currently no preorder bonuses for RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic. It’s unlikely that’ll change in the coming weeks, though if anything is announced, we’ll update this section with details.</p><div title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3152" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6529329 - RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic Physical Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DQYNYZRS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases April 24</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>RollerCoaster Tycoon Classic is essentially the best parts of RollerCoaster Tycoon and RollerCoaster Tycoon 2. Just like those games, you'll build, customize, and manage your own theme park. Along with the option to simply build and manage your park in a free-form effort, there’s a structured Park Scenarios system that tasks you with completing 95 challenges from the first two games. This version of the game includes the Toolkit, Wacky Worlds, and Time Twister expansion packs. Physical editions are available to preorder at most retailers. The game is also available now digitally.</p>                      </div><p>This isn’t the first RollerCoaster Tycoon game on Switch, as you’ll also find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/RollerCoaster-Tycoon-Adventures-Deluxe-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0C9R5S1F7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RollerCoaster Tycoon Adventures: Deluxe Edition</a> for $30.

The picks mostly include HD remasters and collections of classic entries in series like Ace Attorney, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Street Fighter, Resident Evil, and more. One of the only major omissions is the Monster Hunter series--likely because Fanatical recently ran a separate Monster Hunter Bundle that is unfortunately no longer available.</p><p dir="ltr">The pricing structure is like Fanatical's other build-your-own bundle deals, with the price per key dropping as you add more games to your bundle. The savings aren't as high as most Fanatical bundle deals, but you're still getting big discounts on most titles. The deal starts at $13 for two games ($6.50 per key), three games for 19 ($6.33 per key), and four games for $25 ($6.25 per key). There's no limit to how many games you can add, meaning you can grab all 21 games for $131.25 if you want. </p><ul><li dir="ltr">Capcom Beat 'em Up Bundle</li><li dir="ltr">Dead Rising 4 - Frank's Big Package</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 4 Special Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Devil May Cry 5 + Vergil</li><li dir="ltr">DmC: Devil May Cry</li><li dir="ltr">Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective</li><li dir="ltr">The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles</li><li dir="ltr">Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite - Definitive Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man 11</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man X Legacy Collection 2</li><li dir="ltr">Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Onimusha: Warlords</li><li dir="ltr">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil &amp; Resident Evil 0 Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 2 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 3 Remake</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 4 (2005) &amp; Resident Evil 5 Gold Edition Double Pack</li><li dir="ltr">Resident Evil 7 Biohazard</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter: 30th Anniversary Collection</li><li dir="ltr">Street Fighter V: Championship Edition</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-launched-today-but-its-not-easy-to-grab-one/1100-6528684/">GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs Launched Today, But It's Not Easy To Grab One</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Both games feature all-new graphics--with the option to swap back to the original PS1 and PS2 graphics on the fly--gameplay tweaks, and in-game galleries full of art and behind-the-scenes materials.

Hopefully, that means we'll see a new single-player entry in the series soon. Either way now is a great time to be a Legacy of Kain fan. Even better, it's also a great time to get into the series if you're new to the games, too, as most of which have been re-released on modern platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Soul Reaver duology only represents one chunk of the overarching Legacy of Kain timeline. The franchise started with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a>, which follows Kain's transformation into a vampire, and its events serve as the basis for the rest of the series and are even revisited--and reframed--by Soul Reaver's time-hopping plot. It was followed up with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blood Omen 2</a>, and while it's largely disconnected from the events of Soul Reaver, it furthers Kain's characterization and Nosgoth's history. Both games are available on the PlayStation Store and on PC via GOG and Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The storyline capped off with Legacy of Kain: Defiance, which directly follows the events of Soul Reaver 1 and 2, and features both Raziel and Kain as playable characters. Fair warning that it ends on a cliffhanger--which is part of why fans have been pining for a new game in the series--but it at least offers some closure on the events of the Soul Reaver arc and is worth grabbing after completing the remastered collection. Legacy of Kain: Defiance is only available on PC (unless you get your hands on a used PS2 copy), but it's currently <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discounted to less than $1 at GOG</a> (normally $7).</p><h2 dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain PC Game Deals</h2><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fblood_omen_legacy_of_kain&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_blood_omen_2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2</a> -- $7</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_soul_reaver_12_remastered&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a> -- $22.49 (<del>$30</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoqocy.com%2Fclick-100770772-15232592%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Flegacy_of_kain_defiance&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsoul-reaver-12-remastered-getting-physical-releases-on-switch-ps5-this-summer%2F1100-6529376%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Legacy of Kain: Defiance</a> -- $0.97 (<del>$7</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-buy-one-get-one-half-off-movie-tv-shows-blu-ray-amazon-february-2025/1100-6529351/">Amazon Kicks Off B1G1 50% Off Movie And TV Series Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-accessory-sale-how-to-save-20-on-playstation-portal-helldivers-2-dualsense-controller-and-more/1100-6529304/">PS5 Accessory Sale - How To Save 20% On PlayStation Portal, Helldivers 2 DualSense Controller, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-preorder-deals-collectors-edition-amazon/1100-6526606/">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii Collector's Edition In Stock At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/">Save On Sid Meier's Civilization 7 Preorders For PC &amp; Mac - Early Access Starts February 6</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-airpods-4-discounted-to-only-100-at-amazon/1100-6526375/">Apple AirPods 4 Discounted To Only $100 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-guitar-controller-gets-biggest-discount-yet/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Guitar Controller Gets Biggest Discount Yet</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-preorders-where-to-get-steelbook-edition-and-best-deals/1100-6526687/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preorders - Where To Get Steelbook Edition And Best Deals</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus-launched-today-but-its-not-easy-to-grab-one/1100-6528684/">GeForce RTX 50-Series GPUs Launched Today, But It's Not Easy To Grab One</a></li>   </ul> </div>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Chapter 6 has gotten off to a pretty strong start, adding new permanent modes with Fortnite OG and Ballistic, dropping a full-sized Godzilla on the island, and ushering in the game's Hatsune Miku era. But Chapter 6 Season 2 is just around the corner, bringing with it a whole new slate of attractions. With a few days to go before Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 starts, here's everything we know so far.</p><h2>When does Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 begin?</h2><p>Season 1 is currently scheduled to come to a close on February 21 at 11 PM PT/ 2 AM ET. That would mean that Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 should begin a few hours later on the morning of Friday, February 21.</p><h2>Will Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 1 have a live finale event?</h2><p>The Jan. 31 update added some interesting items to the Fortnite game files, including many indications that Season 1 <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1885260657940971852" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will end with some sort of ambient live event</a> on the battle royale island to bring the season story to a close. What exactly the event will entail is still a mystery, but the first stage of buildup has begun--the NPC Daigo has moved on from the spot in the Nightshift Forest where he's been battling demons all season and has taken up new residence by the unused portal in the mountains above Warrior's Watch, and that is where the big finale will go down.</p><h2>Fortnite chapter 6 Season 2 battle pass and season theme</h2><p>No part of the battle pass has leaked just yet, but we've got a big hint in the form of a theme: <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1886127448703533108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reportedly</a>, Chapter 6 Season 2 will be <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1886129502956249167" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another heist season</a>. Fortnite has had a lot of heist seasons, including two different ones in Chapter 4. Since Chapter 6 already echoes Chapter 4 with the feudal theme and a throwback version of the Japan biome from that map--Seaport City is basically proto-Mega City in terms of its layout and structure, and the surrounding areas are very similar--the return of a prominent Chapter 4 theme isn't too shocking.</p><p>Epic Games co-founder Mark Rein has the seasonal tradition of teasing each upcoming season with a single word--his word for Season 12 is <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/1889054637803593935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"pickled."</a> We don't know what all that terms entails, but it likely has something to do with the Kappa Kappa pickle factory that was added to the map last month, and all those little posters there that appear to depict a pickled version of Peely. So I'd expect a big pickle man skin in the battle pass, at least.</p><h2>Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 potential collabs</h2><p>Like we said above, there aren't any confirmed details yet about Chapter 6 Season 2 cosmetics. But there are some rumored collaborations coming up that may fall into Season 2. In particular, there have been reports of <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885257390993342568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cosmetics based on James Cameron's Avatar, </a>and <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1885281187586822448" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a customizable Iron Man skin</a>. Both of these leaked collabs could happen during Season 1, but I think that's unlikely for the Iron Man skin specifically because there are also rumors of new cosmetics tied to Captain America: Brave New World, which is in theaters on February 14.</p><p>It seems unlikely that Marvel would undercut its own timely collab for a skin that could be released literally any time, and a customizable Iron Man skin sounds more like a battle pass thing anyway, given the lack of style options we've seen among item shop collab skins for the past year. See, for example, the Iron Man Mk. 45 skin that Epic dropped in the shop last fall, which had no style options at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events lately, including Monday Night RAW in January, Royal Rumble on February 1, and also the upcoming Elimination Chamber in March. But none of the existing WWE skins have even appeared in the item shop in seven months and counting, so we're overdue for some wrestling content in Fortnite.</p><h2>Other rumors and leaks for Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2</h2><p>One particularly interesting change that Epic made with Chapter 6 was to allow players to use their Festival guitars and other instruments as pickaxes and back blings, dramatically increasing the hypothetical usefulness of those cosmetics--if you like hitting things with guitars, anyway. Now, reportedly, Epic is looking at doing something similar with kicks by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1887927606747500639" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">turning the shoes that certain skins are wearing into kicks</a>--meaning, for example, that buying the Green Roots Billie skin would also grant you her green and black Air Force 1 Mids as kicks to use on any skin.</p><p>Stick around as we'll be updating this roundup of Fortnite Chapter 6 Season 2 news, rumors, and leaks frequently as we approach the start date.</p>

                <p>2025 is shaping up to be a big year for Nintendo, as the Mario company is launching a highly anticipated new system, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. But the company isn't going to rely only on traditional hardware and games to find success. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has opened up on why Nintendo must push "beyond video games" to encourage people to engage with Nintendo.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a>, Furukawa said Nintendo is making use of theme parks, official stores, "visual content," and mobile experiences to "generate interest in our core business." In case there was any doubt, Furukawa stressed that the "dedicated video game platform business" is Nintendo's core business, and efforts outside of that are being undertaken to funnel people back there.</p><p>"Going forward, even as we transition to Nintendo Switch 2, it remains important to increase touchpoints beyond video games," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive said content and experiences for smart phones will play a "very important" role in this effort, and Nintendo will continue to push in this area, Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's push into the mobile market has already reached some 900 million cumulative downloads, Furukawa said, noting that some of Nintendo's success in the smartphone business has come in countries and regions that don't have support for Nintendo's traditional game consoles.</p><p>"I believe this has increased the opportunities for more people to access Nintendo IP and characters," Furukawa said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="101555588"

with Pokemon Go company Niantic. Nintendo shut down online services for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp at the end of 2024 amid a transition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camps-microtransaction-free-version-is-out-now-for-10-doubles-soon/1100-6528152/" data-ref-id="1100-6528152">making it a paid game called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete.</a></p><p>"Although we cannot provide details on future application releases, we are continuing to develop new game applications," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo also has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music app</a>, which launched in 2024 and continues to get updates that add new tracks. In general, Furukawa said Nintendo's aim is to use smartphone apps to "create opportunities for consumers to come into contact with Nintendo game worlds and music even outside of dedicated game systems."</p><p>He added: "Going forward, we would like to continue to develop these types of initiatives, including integration with games, for individual titles."</p><p>Furukawa acknowledged that, for many people, their first gaming platform is not a traditional console but rather a smart device. So Nintendo is trying to meet people where they are, with the assumption being that one day they might pick up a Switch console and games, in addition to whatever they might use and enjoy on their smart phone.</p><p>"We will continue to deliberate on this topic," Furukawa said.</p><p>Even before Furukawa was named president of Nintendo, the company acknowledged that a growing percentage of people first encounter Nintendo experiences outside of a platform that Nintendo sells. For example, previous president Tatsumi Kimishima said fewer and fewer young people are finding out about Nintendo games through... games. Instead, they're discovering Nintendo and its characters through things like <a href="http://www.armandhammer.com/personal-care/kids-toothbrushes/Products/spinbrush-mario.aspx" rel="nofollow ">officially licensed Mario toothbrushes</a>. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-mario-toothbrushes-and-other-licensing-de/1100-6434624/" data-ref-id="1100-6434624">said in 2016</a> that people can expect these kinds of licensing deals to continue and possibly increase, and indeed they have.</p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in 2023, is perhaps Nintendo's biggest non-gaming success story so far--it brought in more than $1.3 billion at the box office. It is one of the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 20 highest-grossing movies in history</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 1 video game movie of all time</a>. Multiple more Nintendo movies are on the way, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Zelda film</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-gets-exciting-update-about-its-characters-and-world/1100-6526856/" data-ref-id="1100-6526856">The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2.</a></p><p>Then there is the Super Nintendo World theme park attraction, which expands in a big way this May when it opens at Universal Studios in Orlando. And anyone who's been to a grocery store or a department store knows full well how many licensed Nintendo toys there are.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, the new console launches later this year. Nintendo will share more details about the system during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct in April. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Those waiting for the Black Hawk Down campaign for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a>, the modern free-to-play revival of the classic FPS series, won't have to wait much longer. Developer Team Jade, a subsidiary of Chinese gaming giant Tencent, announced the paid DLC will launch February 21.</p><p dir="ltr">Delta Force's upcoming Black Hawk Down campaign is a remake of the 2003 shooter of the same name, it in turn based on a book documenting the real events involving a US military task force during the Somali Civil War in 1993. Team Jade released a brief teaser trailer alongside the release date to give fans an idea of what to expect, showing battles through the destroyed streets of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnHhjWNxds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pXnHhjWNxds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Black Hawk Down campaign for Delta Force was originally slated to arrive in January, so its new February release date is actually a delay. As for how much the campaign will cost, Team Jade has not officially said just yet. Team Jade states in the description for the campaign's launch teaser trailer that more details will be coming in the following days. In a development diary Q&amp;A from last year, Team Jade said the campaign DLC will not feature microtransactions and can be played co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force-black-hawk-down/" data-ref-id="5000-4624">Delta Force: Black Hawk Down</a> was the sixth game in developer NovaLogic's Delta Force tactical FPS series, and released on PC in 2003 before being ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't interesting in checking out Delta Force's campaign, its free-to-play multiplayer offerings have been regularly updated in the weeks following its December 2024 release. The game has drawn comparisons to EA's Battlefield series for the large player counts and vehicle gameplay seen in its Warfare game mode, but additionally includes an extraction-style mode and a 3v3v3 squad-focused game type called Hot Zone. Though Delta Force is currently only available on PC, it is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile sometime this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Battlefield, EA recently gave fans a first-look at gameplay for the next entry in the series alongside announcing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">community testing program called Battlefield Labs</a> intended to help it avoid some of the pitfalls of Battlefield 2042.</p>

                <p>EA has called on fans to provide feedback on the art direction of the reimagined of Plants vs. Zombies 3.</p><p>"We ran some external tests to gather insight into which art styles sparked interest among participants in our focus groups! We’re actively gathering that data, but we also know that there’s no better feedback than yours--the passionate PvZ community," EA said in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>.</p><p>EA showed three images of the same plant punching a zombie but in three different art styles and is asking fans to share their thoughts on social media with the hashtag #PvZ3 and which one they prefer. The first one is a slightly 3D cel-shaded art direction compared to the second one. However, the third one is much more dynamic, looking like a comic-book panel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441396" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441396"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441396-image_2025-02-10_152144602.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png" data-ref-id="1300-4441393,1300-4441394,1300-4441395" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441393-1.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441394-2.png.adapt.1920w.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4441395-3.png.adapt.1920w.png"></figure><p>Plants vs. Zombies 3 was first announced in 2019 and soft-launched in various regions over the past few years such as Australia and the Philippines.

                <p dir="ltr">Kinetic Games revealed its 2025 roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/">Phasmophobia</a> updates in a new <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, including two new modifications to how ghost hunts work and plans for extensive map reworks. None of these updates have firm release dates yet, though Kinetic plans to release its first map overhaul in March 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">The news comes alongside another announcement from Kinetic, which is that Phasmophobia has sold more than 22 million copies since it first entered early access in September 2020.</p><p dir="ltr">The first map rework is for Bleasdale Farmhouse, one of the horror game’s first locations. Kinetic said the rework “completely overhauls” the location and adds new assets, more props, and a new look for the formerly bleak, run-down homestead. The other two maps Kinetic plans to rework in 2025 are Grafton Farmhouse and Tanglewood Drive, both of which have remained unchanged since first appearing early during Phasmophobia’s early access period.</p><p dir="ltr">“These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them,” Kinetic said in the roadmap blog post. “So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however.”</p><p dir="ltr">At some point during 2025, Kinetic will launch Phasmophobia’s Chronicle update, which introduces a new reward scheme for capturing evidence. Currently, Phasmophobia rewards players with bonus money rewards for capturing high-quality photos or video of a ghost. The Chronicle update removes quality grading and classes evidence as unique--for the first time the player captures a piece of evidence--or standard. The idea is to reward players more thoroughly for gathering evidence and using recording devices, and the update will also introduce a sound recorder.</p><p dir="ltr">Kinetic has a second major update planned for later in 2025 dubbed the Player Character Overhaul. This update will add more customization features and improve character models, among other changes.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Kinetic said you can expect improved seasonal events in 2025. The team is sticking with its three existing events--Blood Moon for Halloween; Winter Fest, featuring Krampus; and an Easter event--but each will include a range of changes based on player feedback from 2024. Kinetic will share more specifics closer to the Easter event’s April 2025 start date, but said that they expect the events will “feel fresh,” despite sticking to the same themes from previous years.</p>
