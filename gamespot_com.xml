                <p>A single throwing knife was the most devastating weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> when the game first launched, and a few weeks later, Gearbox finally fixed the infamous tool. Seemingly gone for good, the "Crit Knife" has come back from the dead, as this week's update has restored it to <em>most</em> of its former glory.</p><p>Originally, the Crit Knife was creating an unintended damage loop that allowed players to melt through even the toughest bosses within seconds. You'd need a throwing knife with the Penetrator augment to achieve this effect, as it would increase your critical hit chance to 100% for five seconds. With the Crit Knife dominating the Borderlands 4 meta and overshadowing viable builds, it was eventually nerfed in the October 23 patch alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-horny-shield-wasnt-supposed-to-be-that-horny-actually/1100-6535701/" data-ref-id="1100-6535701">horny BDSM shield</a>.</p><p>This new version of the Crit Knife wasn't bad, but it definitely left a lot to be desired. Gearbox made it so that the Penetrator Augment would create a flat 30% critical hit chance for five seconds, which could actually reduce the effect if you had any buffs or gear equipped to increase it.</p><p>This week's patch has changed things up yet again, as a bug has now made the Penetrator Augment capable of adding an extra 30% critical hit chance--and it can stack when used--giving players up to 90% critical hit chance over the five-second window of opportunity.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!<br>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. <br>Silly but yeah. lmao. This damn knife dude. <a href="https://t.co/R2d8yI3TZT" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/R2d8yI3TZT</a></p>  — LazyData (@Lazy_Data) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>This means that while the Crit Knife isn't as good as it once was, it's still very close to its pre-update levels--for now, at least. Gearbox has been doing weekly updates and hotfixes to the game since launch, and this will likely be patched out soon. For now, if you have the Crit Knife, enjoy it while it lasts.</p><p>If you still need one, you can always redeem a few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-shift-codes-all-active-keys-and-how-to-redeem-them/1100-6533833/">Borderlands 4 Shift codes to add a few Golden Keys to your inventory</a>, which can then be used to unlock treasure chests containing powerful randomized gear around the Kairos map. In related news, 2K announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-next-crossover-is-one-you-will-never-guess/1100-6535741/">Borderlands 4 was set to invade PGA Tour 2K25</a> this week. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/">The game has had impressive sales in the US</a> so far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-first-paid-dlc-brings-new-story-based-missions-bosses-and-legendary-loot/1100-6535395/">and its first post-launch DLC</a> will add more story missions, bosses, and new loot in November. Out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, a Switch 2 release is also currently in development.</p>

                <p>A streamer who found himself in the legal crosshairs of Nintendo has been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages to the company. Nintendo sued Jesse "EveryGameGuru" Keighin in 2024, accusing him of livestreaming pirated games before they were released and for sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators.</p><p>Keighin had gone on the offensive after he was accused, telling Nintendo that "you might run a corporation, but I run the streets," on his social media channels (via <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/" rel="nofollow ">TorrentFreak</a>). The lawsuit accused Keighin of streaming leaked Nintendo games since 2022, and Nintendo claimed that his actions had cost the company "millions of dollars" in lost video game sales. Keighin reportedly did not have a prepared defense for the case, leading to a default judgment against him.</p><p>Nintendo had also requested a broad permanent injunction against Keighin and any third parties working with him to prevent them from using emulators--as well as the destruction of "all infringing" hardware and software--but the Colorado court did not agree to this request, rejecting it as "unclear" and "unreasonable" demands.</p><p>Known for being notoriously litigious when it comes to protecting its IP, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo also sued James Williams</a> recently, who moderated a Reddit page that promoted Switch piracy. Nintendo is demanding $4.5 million from Williams, accusing him of running several Switch piracy sites and selling pirated Switch games. Last year, Nintendo was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-lawsuit-shuts-down-switch-emulator-yuzu-and-3ds-emulator-citra/1100-6521589/">successful in shutting down Switch and 3DS emulators</a>, and it is currently involved in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/">legal battle against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p>
