                <p dir="ltr">A consumer rights watchdog in Brazil has launched a legal challenge against Nintendo for its policy of "bricking" the consoles of users who violate the console's terms of service. This policy is a new addition to Nintendo's user agreement. The change took effect on May 7, just a month before the Nintendo Switch 2 launched. Procon-SP, the SÃ£o Paulo branch of the Brazilian Consumer Protection and Defense Program, has raised a complaint with Nintendo itself, claiming the policy violates consumer rights.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">IGN</a>, reports of "bricked" consoles have emerged since the Switch 2's launch. Affected users have speculated that bans result from the use of flash memory cards generally, and the MIG Switch device in particular, both of which can be used for piracy. A bricked console cannot access the internet and will display the error code 2124-4508. The ban encompasses paid online features like GameChat and online multiplayer, but also unpaid ones, like downloading patches or verifying Game-Key carts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, it is the console itself that is banned, not just the user account of the offender. This means that purchasing a Switch 2 secondhand could result in buying a "bricked" console, one that cannot access any of the console's online features. According to IGN, this has already happened. Nintendo has stated that such a ban is permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Procon-SP's statement</a>, Nintendo has agreed to respond to the claim within 20 days. The organization encourages Brazilian consumers to log their bans on the watchdog's official website while it waits on Nintendo's response.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, the company has responded to concerns that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-addresses-concerns-over-switch-2s-price-keeping-kids-from-getting-it/1100-6532994/">the console's price point would be a barrier to younger fans</a>. Nintendo is also considering <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-may-use-shorter-development-periods-on-some-games-to-offset-high-costs/1100-6532996/">shorter development times to offset growing costs</a>.</p>

                <p>Twenty years ago at E3 2005, Sony showed off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-2-review/1900-6205274/" data-ref-id="1900-6205274">Killzone 2</a> video as an example of the PlayStation 3's power over its rival console, Microsoft's Xbox 360. However, Sony later admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-the-killzone/1100-6304486/" data-ref-id="1100-6304486">the Killzone 2 video wasn't actually gameplay footage</a> and that it was meant to be a "target render" for the team to achieve. Now, former Xbox boss Peter Moore has shared that he knew all along that the Killzone 2 demo was "BS."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-xbox-took-on-playstation-and?utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Moore recalled that Sony pulled a similar trick to outshine the Dreamcast when he worked for Sega. Sony essentially tried to adopt the strategy a second time to overshadow Xbox 360's launch.</p>

<p>"It was exactly the same tactics of creating a very expensive movie," said Moore. "But when the game came out, it was completely BS. I knew it that night when I watched it. I thought there's no way they're delivering this experience. They were doing the same thing to us as they did with Sega, which is go: 'Alright, cute little Xbox 360 coming out, but the big boys will be out with the PlayStation 3, so you should hang around and wait for that. Because look what we can do.'"</p><p>According to Moore, game journalists also recognized Sony's strategy and quickly came to the conclusion that the PS3 wasn't powerful enough to produce that level of detail in real-time.</p><p>Moore went on to describe Microsoft's strategic rollout of Xbox 360, and added that landing the console-exclusive rights for Call of Duty 2 went a long way towards the company's success.</p><p>In the present, Call of Duty remains the most-successful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">FPS</a> franchise, which is now owned by Microsoft after the Activision Blizzard sale. As for Killzone, the most recent game in the franchise was 2013's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-shadow-fall-review/1900-6415536/" data-ref-id="1900-6415536">Killzone Shadow Fall</a>.

Dubbed Chronological Mode, this new way to experience the game's story arranges the sprawling campaign into an organized timeline, allowing players to see it and its characters in a brand-new light.</p><p>A post to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a> reads, "Through the new Chronological mode, we believe players will gain even deeper insight into Part IIâs narrative. Players will be able to see how Ellie being gifted a guitar flows so neatly into her learning to play, for example, while the journey through Seattle will showcase the fascinating parallels between Ellie and Abbyâs crisscrossing journeys."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1942599934399701261?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Experience The Last of Us Part II in a whole new way with Chronological mode, a rearranged version of the game that lets you play the story in chronological order. ð<br>Available now with The Last of Us Part II Remastered via Patch v2.1.0 (PS5)*â  and Patch v1.5 (PC)*.

The notion of experiencing both Ellie and Abby's final days in Seattle back to back with nothing to break up the onslaught of violence is already overwhelming.</p><p>Depending on who you ask, this move could be inspired or downright heretical. The Last of Us Part II was released back in 2020 to no shortage of acclaim <em>and </em>controversy over its story and non-linear structure. Infamously, a contingent of players at the time panned the decision to break from the perspective of Ellie, one of the franchises main characters, about halfway through the game in order to drop players into the shoes of Abby, an entirely new character that players had become familiar with as one of the sequel's villains. This change in perspective is also being applied to the ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/">TV adaptation of The Last of Us</a> on HBO, whose upcoming third season will center Abby just like the second half of the sequel game.</p><p>In addition to Chronological Mode, the new update for The Last of Us Part II Remastered will feature new trophies and skins for players to unlock. The remaster, which was released just last year, also features a roguelike mode called No Return, where players can pick from among the game's cast and brawl through brutal, randomized encounters across the game's different backdrops.</p><p>With this latest update, Naughty Dog has added two new skins for players to pick from, and both are nods to Naughty Dog's other major franchise, Uncharted. As long as players complete the game's story in Chronological Mode, they should be able to unlock Joel dressed as Nathan Drake, as well as Joel's brother Tommy dressed as Nathan's brother, Sam, from Uncharted 4.</p><p>This update is available as of today on PS5 and PC.</p>
