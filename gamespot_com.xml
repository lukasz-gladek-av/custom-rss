                <p>This was the Kirby Air Ride match where legends were born. Two players faced off on the streets of City Trial, each maneuvering Kirby with precision. One player had assembled what seemed to be an unstoppable, legendary machine--a combination of three difficult-to-collect pieces that granted a huge advantage. The other player gambled, taking a risky move in striking the machine and destroying it before the match ended. Against all odds, the underdog seized the win. It was a comeback rarely seen in the tight knit Kirby Air Ride community that's been riding Warp Stars for more than five years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70tL_46qwDU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/70tL_46qwDU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">This wasn’t just a match--it was a demonstration of the skill, strategy, and intuition that fuels the Kirby Air Ride community. Now, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/kirby-air-riders-everything-to-know/2300-6466521/" data-ref-id="2300-6466521">Kirby Air Riders</a> on the horizon, that community is buzzing louder than ever. The promise of a new official release has fans analyzing trailers and previews, debating which abilities will dominate, and counting down the days until they can prove themselves within the City Trial.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was no easy way to play Kirby Air Ride competitively before 2017. Kirby Air Ride wasn't seen as viable," Kirby Air Ride caster Betokirby tells GameSpot. "Then you see UnclePunch working with others to make the HackPack. The HackPack is where competitive Kirby Air Ride started."</p><p dir="ltr">The roots of competitive Kirby Air Ride can be traced back to a Super Smash Bros. modder known online as <a href="https://x.com/UnclePunch_" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UnclePunch</a>. In 2017, he began collaborating with others to create the HackPack, a mod that would fundamentally reshape the way players approached the game. The HackPack added a simple change: a dedicated B button for breaking. Suddenly, players had greater control over their movement and speed, opening the door to more precise, skill-based gameplay.</p><p>"Kirby Air Ride needed the love it deserved," UnclePunch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KirbyAirRide/comments/7gl09f/kirby_air_ride_hack_pack_v10_released/" rel="nofollow ">wrote</a> in 2017 when he released the 1.0 version of the HackPack.</p><p dir="ltr">Uncle Punch didn’t stop there. Abilities and attacks were modded to be separated to two buttons, letting playing actually aim before they shot. It added a layer of tension and strategy that elevated casual matches into something more competitive and technical.</p><p dir="ltr">With the HackPack in place, organized, bracketed tournaments that drew attention from the fanbase began to pop up in a <a href="https://discord.gg/SmZFfnDc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Discord server</a>. Fifty or so entrants would gather for these competitions, meticulously practicing techniques in order to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Each match became a chess game at high speed, with players anticipating each other’s moves while managing the chaos of abilities, obstacles, and speed boosts. Online tournaments alike grew in popularity, proving that Kirby Air Ride was more than just a nostalgic curiosity--it was a game that demanded skill and strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">Then came the announcement that no one saw coming. Kirby Air Riders was revealed during a Nintendo Direct, and the response was instantaneous and overwhelming.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="154155524" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"I had never seen that many in that small corner of the internet. It was like Jesus had returned. Kirby Air Ride only had a cult following up until that point. When I say cult following, if Sakurai came out and said we had to jump off a bridge, there would be 5,000 people lining up.”</p><p dir="ltr">For years, the community had been quietly passionate, but this announcement turned that simmering dedication into an inferno.</p><p dir="ltr">The impact was immediate. Interest in the competitive Kirby Air Ride scene grew overnight. New players joined Discord servers, longtime veterans dusted off their setups, and tournament entries more than doubled. For a community that had survived on nostalgia, modding, and word-of-mouth tournaments, this was the validation they had been waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">As fans look forward to Kirby Air Riders, the legacy of the HackPack, UnclePunch, and the competitive community is clear. The game’s technical and chaotic core remains unchanged, but now, with a new official platform, the stakes are higher and the audience larger. And for those who have been racing in basements and modding their way to perfection, it feels like a dream realized--a chance to take their skills from underground battles to center stage.</p><p dir="ltr">With Kirby Air Riders downloaded onto their consoles, organizers hope the community will reach new highs.</p>

                <p>Usually, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players like it when Epic Games offers a free skin. But that's not the case for Freediver, a new skin that's <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1990819375410983115" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for free only through the Priority app</a>, which offers various deals and rewards to customers of UK mobile providers O2 and Virgin Media. O2 and Virgin members can use the Priority app to claim a code that'll let them unlock the skin by gaining a couple account levels.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="1125" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4606903"></a><figcaption>O2 and Virgin Media customers in the UK can unlock the Freediver skin for free in the Priority app. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4606903-freediver.jpg"></figure><p>Having a skin locked to specific regional mobile providers means that most of the people in the world cannot get this skin. Not that they'd probably notice, since it's a fairly basic and not particularly interesting skin. But for folks who seriously collect Fortnite skins, that scarcity is a large part of its appeal--having this skin hypothetically offers a little bit of metaverse cred, since it's not something everyone can even get.</p><p>We'll probably be seeing more of this, however, because this is the second time this year Epic has done this exact thing. Back in August, Epic offered a purple version of this same skin--dubbed <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=19255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Thrilldiver</a>--only to users of the Brazilian telecom company Vivo. It's likely that this free skin is part of Epic's renewed push for mobile players, and that more recolors of this skin will be offered to other groups of mobile customers.</p><p>Fans of freebies who feel like they're missing out can take solace in the fact that the winter holiday season is about to start, and Epic usually gives out multiple free skins this time of year. In the final six weeks of 2024, for example, Fortnite offered free Juice WRLD and Snoop Dogg skins, as well as the Fortnite-original Yulejacket, plus accessories for all of them.</p>
