                <p>After the story events unravel in Dawnshore, you'll make your way to the Emerald Stair map in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. The ambassador has heard that the Dreamscourge has started to take over the region and he wants you to investigate what's going on in the main city of Fior mes Iverno. You're able to travel to Emerald Stair through a gate and arrive to a map that's fully covered with fog, exactly how Dawnshore was when you firs started the game.</p><p>While it's exciting to uncover a new map, it can also be a little overwhelming, as you're not sure where to go. Fortunately, we took the time to completely uncover Emerald Stair's map so you know everything it has to offer in Avowed.</p><h2>Full Emerald Stair Map in Avowed</h2><p>Compared to Dawnshore, Emerald Stair is a much more open map that's not as full of buildings and dedicated roads to follow. While there are still roads and plenty of locations to visit, you'll find more room to roam in the animancer paradise. Emerald Stair has a total of six large regions, including Fior mes Iverno, and they are as follows:</p><ul><li>Fior mes Iverno</li><li>Maxim's Claim</li><li>Rolling Crags</li><li>The Wildwoods</li><li>The Delemgan Glade</li><li>Grim Wetlands</li></ul><p>You'll find a majority of the map's distinct regions in the bottom half of the map, but there are still sights to see in the northern parts of the map as well. Below, you can see full images of the Emerald Stair fully uncovered in Avowed:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446341"></a><figcaption>Northern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446341-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.23.79.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446342"></a><figcaption>Southern Emerald Stair map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446342-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.52.15.92.png"></figure><p>As you can see, Fior mes Iverno as a whole is covered. When you enter the hub city, you can bring up a dedicated map showcasing its unique shops and areas. Then, when you exit the city, you'll see the normal Emerald Stair map again.</p><h2>Emerald Stair Key Points of Interest</h2><p>While Emerald Stair isn't quite as large as Dawnshore, it still has plenty to offer. As always, there are treasure maps to find and follow as well as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-defiance-pieces-and-locations-in-emerald-stair/1100-6529471/" data-ref-id="1100-6529471">Totem of Defiance</a> pieces to gather. There's also a total of 15 fast travel beacons and nine Party Camps, so you have no shortage of ways to get around the map.</p><p>You can see a full accounting of other major points of interest in Emerald Stair below:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Directly to the north of Tama's Cabin and to the northeast The Delemgan Glade. You have to climb a small cliff to reach the Adra, which is sitting at the top of the cliff.</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>The Voice's Memory is located right near the Ranger Outpost area just to the south of The Wildwoods. It's also near a fast travel beacon and not too difficult to reach.</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>The Emerald Stair Pargrun Cache is located to the west of The Wildwoods and south of The Delemgan Glade. It's tucked away near the western edge of the map in the middle of a forest.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-earthy-aegis-treasure-map-location/1100-6529528/" data-ref-id="1100-6529528">Earthy Aegis</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-practical-pockets-treasure-map-location/1100-6529529/" data-ref-id="1100-6529529">Practical Pockets</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-painters-regret-treasure-map-location/1100-6529527/" data-ref-id="1100-6529527">Painter's Regret</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Naku Tedek Grounds in the south part of Emerald Stair (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-emerald-stair-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529445/" data-ref-id="1100-6529445">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>And that wraps up all the major points of interest in Emerald Stair. It's arguably the most beautiful map in Avowed, so try and soak up the beauty as you're dodging mushrooms, delemgans, and other dangerous enemies.</p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

                <p>Dawnshore is the first official map you can visit in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>. It's the home to Paradis, where you, as the official Aedryan envoy, need to meet with the ambassador to discuss the growing concern of the Dreamscourge. Of course, Dawnshore is home to much more than Paradis, and the fairly large map can be explored in its entirety as soon as you get off the boat at Claviger's Landing. While we recommend you complete some main story missions first, you'll eventually want to explore the majority of Dawnshore to see everything that Avowed has to offer in its opening hours.</p><p>We went through the trouble of uncovering all the necessary fog on the Dawnshore map so you know exactly where everything is located. Below, you can see the map completely uncovered along with some key points of interest.</p><h2>Full Dawnshore Map in Avowed</h2><p>If you think Paradis is big when you arrive in the city, you haven't seen anything yet. The map of Dawnshore is a gorgeous place full of secret caves, dangerously high vistas, and several different regions. In total, there are seven major regions including Paradis, and they are:</p><ul><li>Paradis</li><li>Ondra's Reach</li><li>Ivona's Threshold</li><li>Fractured Shore</li><li>Southern Embrace</li><li>Overgrown Frontier</li><li>The Rise</li></ul><p>To see everything Dawnshore has to offer, you want to visit all seven of these regions, where you'll find smaller areas that can be explored. Here are full images of the entire uncovered Dawnshore map:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446329"></a><figcaption>Northern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446329-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.51.44.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png" data-ref-id="1300-4446327"></a><figcaption>Southern Dawnshore map in Avowed</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4446327-avowedscreenshot2025.02.18-23.51.42.16.png"></figure><p>The only covered part of the map is Paradis Hightown, which can't be uncovered on the map. Instead, you can visit that location directly and view a dedicated map that showcases all of its different areas.</p><h2>Dawnshore Key Points of Interest</h2><p>Dawnshore certainly has plenty to see and do, including going on a few different treasure map hunts and finding all the pieces to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-all-totem-of-rightful-rulership-locations-in-dawnshore/1100-6529446/" data-ref-id="1100-6529446">Totem of Rightful Rulership</a>.</p><p>In total, there are 11 fast travel beacons and four Party Camps in Dawnshore, giving you plenty of ways to get around the map quicker. If you want to find all the fast travel beacons, follow the red lines that become visible on the map as you uncover more fog. Those red lines represent the main road, and fast travel beacons mostly spawn along those lines.</p><p>Below, we'll list off some points of interest in Dawnshore and where you can find them so you can visit them quickly as you play:</p><p><strong>Strangled Adra</strong></p><ul><li>Right behind the Emerald Stair Gatehouse on the far eastern side of Dawnshore</li></ul><p><strong>The Voice</strong></p><ul><li>On the edge of the Watcher's Mirror location, which is northeast of Paradis and facing the far eastern river</li></ul><p><strong>Pargrun Cache</strong></p><ul><li>For sweet rewards, head to the top of Dawnshore right above the Pilgrim's Path and Godless Ruins. There you'll find the Pargrun Cache, which requires some work to get into but has a chest full of unique rewards. Every map in Avowed has a Pargrun Cache.</li></ul><p><strong>Treasure Maps</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-intimidating-feline-codpiece-treasure-map-location/1100-6529375/" data-ref-id="1100-6529375">Intimidating Feline Codpiece</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-captain-henquas-spoils-treasure-map-location/1100-6529374/" data-ref-id="1100-6529374">Captain Henqua's Spoils</a></li><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-woedicas-inheritance-treasure-map-location/1100-6529372/" data-ref-id="1100-6529372">Woedica's Inheritance</a></li></ul><p><strong>Mapping the Living Lands Cartographer </strong></p><ul><li>Near the Usher's Hand area to the east of Paradis (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-dawnshore-cartographer-location-for-mapping-the-living-lands/1100-6529403/" data-ref-id="1100-6529403">exact location in a separate guide</a>)</li></ul><p>That just about does it for all the main points of interest on the Dawnshore map in Avowed. There are, of course, plenty of additional locations you can visit for main story and side quests, so make sure you're partaking in as much content as possible to easily explore the map. </p><p>Obsidian is no stranger to crafting compelling RPGs.

                <p>Supergiant's Hades 2 just received its second major update, which brings in a familiar face, but adds in so much more. Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld and sister to Zagreus, the protagonist of the first game, will be aided by the ultra-violent Ares and can now be granted his boons. There's also the addition of animal familiars, and several boons that have been reworked.</p><p>The Warsong Update is a free, automatic download as part of the early access development of Hades 2. Players may need to restart their Steam client to initiate the download. So let's break down what's new and improved for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrpGYTlCjNQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yrpGYTlCjNQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>The Final Confrontation: Battle to the summit of Mount Olympus and discover what awaits...</li><li>New Olympian: Meet the god of war himself, and choose from his many Boons</li><li>New Familiar: Find one last animal companion to join your journey and aid you in battle</li><li>Revamped Boons: Gain many powerful new and improved blessings from various Olympians</li><li>Revamped Altar of Ashes: Activate several reworked effects, and each Card now has all-new artwork</li><li>Revamped Resource Gathering: Worry no more about which resources you can collect</li><li>Revamped Menus: Look for new and improved animations across many menu screens</li><li>Expanded Story: Discuss the final confrontation and more with many different characters</li></ul><p>As for general gameplay, players no longer prioritize Gathering Tools in the Training Grounds, but they can still harvest any type of resource as long as they have unlocked each Tool. Psyche can no longer be found as a Location Reward; Bones may now be found sooner, instead.</p><p>In addition, all Guardians and Wardens with Guardian-style Life Bars are now resistant to the slowing effect of your Casts; previously this applied only to some of them, so watch out for that. Defenses have also been retooled, as any damage resistance effects you have no longer affect any Armor you have. Finally, Supergiant adjusted the requirements for certain key events early on. So, theoretically, it should be possible to reach the surface earlier than before.</p><p>You can check out the full list of reworked Boons <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/503942841152569404" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>, including Chaos' Barren which, after community feedback, now reduces your Curse duration.</p><p>"Early Access continues to be an essential part of Hades II development, and we hope you can feel this reflected in our Major Updates and other patches so far," Supergiant said. "With the core structure of both the Underworld and Surface routes now fully intact, we're excited to turn our attention to filling out more of the game's content categories, finishing more and more of what we started...until we're done!"</p><p>With this update now available, Supergiant says a third major update is on the way "some months from now." There's no word on when the 1.0 release will happen.</p>

                <p>When it comes to treasure, smooth gunplay, and chatterbox robots, Borderlands is in a class of its own. A new mainline entry in the looter-shooter series is set to arrive soon, and this new chapter in the ongoing saga of Vault Hunters and alien booty looks set to introduce some interesting changes to the formula of this long-running series. Ahead of its release in September, we've gathered up everything we know about Borderlands 4 so far, and what you can expect from the game when it's unleashed on PC and console.</p><h2 id="When_will_Borderlands_4_be_released_">When will Borderlands 4 be released?</h2><p>Borderlands 4 will be released on September 23, and is one of several big games that Take-Two has lined up for the year.

We've seen glimpses of him in the trailers for Borderlands 4, and from what little information has been revealed, we do know that he's a sharp-dressed dictator aiming to create a perfect world order. That, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/">and he's apparently far more dangerous than Handsome Jack ever was</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445630"></a><figcaption>One of the new locales you'll explore in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445630-borderlands4%287%29.jpg"></figure><p>While Borderlands 3 expanded beyond Pandora to several other worlds, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-seamless-world-and-movement-mechanics-will-make-it-hard-for-players-to-go-back/1100-6528427/">Borderlands 4 will take place on the planet of Kairos</a>. Because the game has been designed for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, this makes Kairos a seamless and "expansive" location to explore. According to Gearbox Software CEO Randy Pitchford, if you see an area of the world that interests you, you'll be free to explore it.</p><p>"One of the challenges with the term 'open world' is other games have done different things with that and there's things that we're doing that none of them have done," Pitchford said. "But there are things that we, specifically, don't do because we are Borderlands. And we care so deeply about combat dynamics and care so deeply about that moment-to-moment feeling. We craft this [world]. Everything that unfolds has [purpose]. You can feel the heart of the designer behind it. You can tell, people that care a lot made this shit."</p><p>"They're putting this here for [the player]. This isn't all just a systemic, algorithmically filled world. So be careful when you're talking about this. I wouldn't say 'open world' because that [term] will come with baggage. That isn't what we are. But it is seamless, and it is expansive, and it is larger than anything we've ever done, and it is filled like nothing we've ever done."</p><p>As for the world itself, Gearbox describes it as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-new-planet-is-shown-off-in-concept-art/1100-6526221/">high-tech but lo-fi location</a> full of interesting opportunities for players to experiment with gameplay and weapons.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445629"></a><figcaption>Meet the new Vault Hunters of Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445629-borderlands4%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Now let's talk about what we know about the game's playable characters so far.</p><p>Vault Hunters are the bread and butter of Borderlands games, as each unique character allows you to experience the main campaign from a different angle. There'll be four Vault Hunters to choose from on launch day--a tradition that dates back to the first Borderlands game--and each one will offer a specific archetype role. Gearbox hasn't elaborated on the Vault Hunter classes yet, but judging from the early gameplay trailers, it looks like we'll get to play as a hulking gunslinger, powerful Siren, and melee-focused swordsman in Borderlands 4.</p><h2 id="Borderlands_4_development_news">Borderlands 4 development news</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4445631"></a><figcaption>This new Vault Hunter is an absolute unit</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4445631-borderlands4%285%29.jpg"></figure><p>Like the previous games, Borderlands is a looter-shooter that mixes an exotic selection of weapons with unique action skills. The previous game shook up its bread-and-butter gunplay by making each weapon family--Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Atlas, Vladof, Tediore, and Torgue--feel even more distinct from each other, so it'll be interesting to see if this idea carries through to Borderlands 4.</p><p>Gearbox has added that it wants to find a balance between approachability and complexity with the gameplay, both with the core first-person-shooting action and the RPG skill-trees that could be customized to create powerful Vault Hunter builds. At the same time, you can expect billions of different weapons to collect on your journey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-narrative-director-doesnt-want-skibidi-or-hawk-tuah-jokes-in-game/1100-6528514/" data-ref-id="1100-6528514">Gearbox wants to cut back on</a> the "overabundance of toilet humor" that Borderlands 3 heavily relied on.</p><p>It also wouldn't be a Borderlands game without an option to catch a ride! So far, we've seen a chunky hoverbike and a high-tech chariot straight out of the pod-racing scene from Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace, and it'll be interesting to see what else we can get behind the wheel of in the full game.</p><p>While you'll be able to get around Kairos with one of several new vehicles, a big upgrade to the gameplay is a grappling hook that can be used to reach areas and help you out in combat.</p><p>The other big question we're still waiting to see answered relates to what we can expect <em>after </em>Borderlands 4 launches.</p><p>In a tradition dating back to the very first Borderlands game, Gearbox has regularly supported its looter-shooters with post-launch DLC expansions. The developer has yet to confirm if this will be the case for Borderlands 4, but we wouldn't be too surprised to see history repeat itself here.</p><p>Some of the best Borderlands stories have come from these expansions after all--like Assault on Dragonkeep, The Claptastic Voyage, and Moxxi's Heist of the Handsome Jackpot--so here's hoping we get a few more post-launch episodes.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-announced-coming-in-september/1100-6529459/" data-ref-id="1100-6529459">Borderlands 4 State of Play event</a> is set for this spring, so it might not be much longer until Gearbox shows off and discusses the game even more.</p>

For the launch of the season, Blizzard has sweetened the deal with some limited-time event challenges that reward even more loot boxes than will be normal. Plus, Discord is getting in on the loot box action as well, offering five of them as a reward for a new quest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZR6lbjMFnk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mZR6lbjMFnk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For the Discord quest, all players will need to do is accept the quest via the app and then play Overwatch 2 for 15 minutes. After completing and claiming the quest, players can redeem the code via Battle.net to receive their five free loot boxes. Quests can be found and accepted in the Discord app via the Discover tab. Players will have until February 25 to accept and complete the quest.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Overwatch 2 weekly event challenges, players will need to first complete five matches (with wins counting as two) and then 15 matches to earn another five loot boxes per challenge. Since wins count as two, these can be done in just a few matches if your team comes out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the Discord quest, and that's a total of 15 loot boxes for very little overall playtime. Players will have until February 25 to complete the in-game challenges, which also feature other rewards like the Rainy Day skin for Mercy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-is-bringing-back-loot-boxes-very-soon-with-some-changes/1100-6529450/" data-ref-id="1100-6529450">Loot boxes work a little differently now</a> from when they first debuted in the original Overwatch. For starters, players can't buy them outright, though they are included as part of the game's free and paid battle pass. An item of Rare or better quality is guaranteed to drop from each box. After opening five boxes, players are guaranteed an Epic-quality item, with a guaranteed Legendary drop after opening 20 boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">The return of loot boxes isn't the only big change as part of Overwatch 2 Season 15, Honor and Glory.

Achievement hunters have plenty of collectibles to chase down for these recorded memoirs.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these collectibles are easily found during your adventures, but some of them are well-hidden or tricky to complete. Here we'll guide you through each collectible category for Tape 1 of Lost Records: Bloom and Rage.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Note: </strong>Chapters can be replayed in Collectible mode to allow you to replay and collect without interfering with your story choices. If ever you're unsure of a chapter we mention in this guide--since the game doesn't always telegraph their names--you can use the game's scene replay feature to browse them by name and jump right to where you want to be.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Woodland_Ruins___6_collectibles_needed">Woodland Ruins - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Graffiti___10_collectibles_needed">Graffiti - 10 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</a></li><li><a href="#Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Scenic_Views___4_collectibles_needed">Scenic Views - 4 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Hunting___8_collectibles_needed">Hunting - 8 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Birds____15_collectibles_needed">Birds! - 15 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Moving_in_Place___6_collectibles_needed">Moving in Place - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#Critters___6_collectibles_needed">Critters - 6 collectibles needed</a></li><li><a href="#More_Cat____9_collectibles_needed">More Cat! - 9 collectibles needed</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Woodland_Ruins___6_collectibles_needed">Woodland Ruins - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446601" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446601"></a><figcaption>Woodland Ruins</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446601-woodlandruins.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This category becomes available during the chapter called <strong>This Old House</strong>. All of these collectibles can be found during this chapter, as well as later trips to the cabin, but they are all pretty easy to obtain.</p><p dir="ltr">You only need six to complete this category, but you'll find more than you need. The most obvious ones being the following:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The deer-shaped weather vane on the roof</li><li dir="ltr">The broken bridge at the cabin</li><li dir="ltr">The wooden outhouse</li><li dir="ltr">The windchimes in nearby tree</li><li dir="ltr">The firepit at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The towels hanging on the line at the lake</li><li dir="ltr">The miner's gravesite on the trail behind the cabin</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Graffiti___10_collectibles_needed">Graffiti - 10 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446603"></a><figcaption>Graffiti on dumpster</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446603-graffiti.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Graffiti is by far the easiest of the collectible categories to complete. You can collect these through most scenes in the game where you explore with your camcorder, but you can complete this all during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">This chapter takes Swann to the parking lot of the Movie Palace. The area is covered in graffiti, including the following areas:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The graffiti marks on the fence's Do Not Enter sign</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the green dumpster near the Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">There are six different graffiti opportunities on the park benches by Yooper Scooper</li><li dir="ltr">Graffiti on the side of the white van</li><li dir="ltr">Spray paint on the right side of the Movie Palace</li><li dir="ltr">Even more graffiti can be found on the rooftop if you take the ladder on the right side</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spotlights__Kat__Nora__Autumn___10_collectibles_each">Spotlights: Kat, Nora, Autumn - 10 collectibles each</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446604"></a><figcaption>Character spotlights</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446604-spotlight.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's really no trick to these spotlight collectibles. Simply record 10 moments for each character. This can all be done during the chapter titled <strong>The First Night</strong>, or you can collect moments more organically throughout the entirety of Tape 1. You can work on this anytime Swann is able to record while with the girls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Forgotten_Playground___6_collectibles_needed">Forgotten Playground - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446605"></a><figcaption>Forgotten Playground</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446605-forgottenplayground.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Forgotten Playground collectibles can be earned during the chapter called <strong>The First Night</strong>. If you miss any, they can also be collected in later scenes where you visit the park, such as during Kat's memoir.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a few more collectibles than you need here, but here are the main ones you'll likely find:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The seesaw</li><li dir="ltr">The marbles on the ground</li><li dir="ltr">The giant rocketship</li><li dir="ltr">The jungle gym</li><li dir="ltr">The animal-shaped spring riders</li><li dir="ltr">Swing set</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Bullies___7_collectibles_needed">Bullies - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446606"></a><figcaption>Filming Dylan after confrontation</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446606-bullies.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The bullies category can be started early on in the game, with the very first encounter with Dylan and Corey during the chapter titled <strong>The Day We Met</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Mild Spoilers: </strong>If you make the same apologetic and non confrontational dialogue choices as I did when dealing with Dylan and Corey, you'll need to <strong>replay this scene in Collectible mode</strong> to get more of these. You need to pick the taunting choices, where you taunt and film Dylan, and then agree to film Corey and his bike.</p><p dir="ltr">The final bully collectibles come from an opportunity to film Corey again later in the game. This comes after near the end of the chapter titled the <strong>Abyss</strong>. This is also optional and missable. Nora will prompt you to film Corey, but the choice is yours.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Water_Tower___4_collectibles_needed">Water Tower - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446607"></a><figcaption>Velvet Cove water tower</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446607-watertower.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is another easy category. You're basically filming the same Velvet Cove water tower throughout various scenes in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of the opportunities are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Film while standing in the Movie Palace parking lot</li><li dir="ltr">Film from Swann's bedroom window in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be filmed from the park in various chapters</li><li dir="ltr">Can be seen from the bar parking lot</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Mothgirl_Chronicles___6_collectibles_needed">Mothgirl Chronicles - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446608"></a><figcaption>Mothgirl placement at the end of Riot Grrrl</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446608-mothgirlfinal.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Mothgirl Chronicles collectible category starts during the chapter called <strong>Packing Up</strong>. This is an unmissable part of the story that takes place in Swann's bedroom, and filming Mothgirl for the first time unlocks this collectible category.</p><p dir="ltr">The remaining five collectibles require you to find a special spot where you can place Mothgirl and film. There don't seem to be any extra locations, so you'll need to replay sections if you miss these.</p><p dir="ltr">These hidden locations are as follows:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Later, during<strong> Packing Up</strong>, there is a scene with the girls at the lake, and you can place Mothgirl on a nearby rock and film her</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Double Dare</strong>, go up into the attic. You'll want to <strong>do this before you light the fireplace</strong>. Place Mothgirl on the ledge of the open section of the attic. (This collectible appears to be glitched. It lets me place Mothgirl here, but the game marks this as a location I've already recorded even though it wasn't previously recorded or in the footage.)</li><li dir="ltr">In the chapter titled <strong>Kat</strong>, you'll film an interview with her. You'll have the option to explore around the park afterwards, so make sure you <strong>grab your collectibles before telling her you're done</strong>. There are two Mothgirl locations here. Place Mothgirl on both the swing and the slide for two more collectible opportunities</li><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong>, you'll break into the fenced-off area of the bar. Immediately look right and place Mothgirl in the lounge chair on the right</li><li dir="ltr">After turning on the power during Riot Grrrls, run back to Nora's band setup and place Mothgirl on one of the speakers</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Terrible_Toys___6_collectibles_needed">Terrible Toys - 6 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446609"></a><figcaption>Bunny car pictured with the moo box on top of it for optional trophy</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446609-terribletoysbunnycar.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Terrible Toys memoir category requires you to film weird toys you find while on your adventures. Not all of these are available at this time, as Don't Nod told GameSpot that one of them is only found in Tape 2, coming this April, but here are the five known locations so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">During the chapter called The First Night, you can find a collectible when helping Kat look for the keys. You'll see a <strong>troll doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">Another toy can be found during The First Night chapter. When looking for something to knock down the keys, you follow Autumn into a junkyard. Here you'll find a <strong>creepy doll</strong> to film at the campsite</li><li dir="ltr">The third one you'll encounter is during the chapter called Garage Band. Inside Nora's garage you'll find a weird <strong>bunny car</strong> to film</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Grab the item sitting on top of the bunny car and inspect it. Rotating the item until it moos like a cow will <strong>unlock the hidden MOO! trophy/achievement</strong> to "Make the moo box moo."</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The next is found during chapter - Lights, Camera, Action! Before you follow your friends across the tree bridge, turn right towards the lake to find another <strong>creepy doll</strong></li><li dir="ltr">The next is a <strong>voodoo doll</strong> that can be found in various times and locations. The best times to look are either during Don't Be Afraid of the Dark or This Old House. Head up into the cabin's attic to find a voodoo doll. The doll can also be found later in the story on a trail leading away from the cabin, or in a small cave entrance. It can only be counted once, though</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that since not all Terrible Toys can be found yet, it may also be the case that some other collectible categories can be finished in Tape 2, likely making those easier to complete.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Strangers___7_collectibles_needed">Strangers - 7 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446610"></a><figcaption>Strangers at the bar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446610-strangers.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are seven collectibles needed for the Strangers memoir category. The entire category is really easy to miss, depending on how you approach specific moments in the game.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The first four can be discovered during the chapter called <strong>The Day We Met</strong>. Before interacting with any characters, use the ladder on the right side of the Movie Palace. You can climb up and get a view of two sets of characters. Corey and Dylan are at the back, and Nora and Autumn are at the Yooper Scooper ice cream shack. Use the camcorder to view them and then record each one as strangers</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There's a <strong>trophy/achievement you can unlock called "Dub and Dubber"</strong> by imitating the strangers as you film them. I had to imitate Corey, Dylan, and Nora before the trophy popped.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">There might be early opportunities I missed, but I got the last three strangers needed for the category recorded before the last part of the <strong>Riot Grrrls</strong> chapter. Once you're tasked with placing the stickers, head to the front of the bar to find three men walking out. Record each of them to complete the Strangers category</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Scenic_Views___4_collectibles_needed">Scenic Views - 4 collectibles needed</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4446611"></a><figcaption>Scenic View captured at the lake during Lights, Camera, Action!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4446611-scenicviews.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Scenic views is a category that only requires four game environments to be recorded, but you'll have several opportunities to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">The first of the scenic views can be captured during the chapter called <strong>Welcome to Velvet Cove</strong>.

This first-person horror game, which follows the final days of a shipwrecked space freighter crew, goes to some truly unsettling places. While Mouthwashing is only a few hours long, the chilling experience has really stuck with players, leading to <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical acclaim</a> from critics and fans alike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGE8yrta8do" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tGE8yrta8do" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Wrong Organ and Critical Reflex have confirmed that Mouthwashing has sold 500,000 copies since its release, an impressive feat for an indie game that flew under the radar prior to its release last September. Now that the game is a proven success, the developers are bringing Mouthwashing to consoles and even giving it a physical release.</p><p>While a specific date has not been shared yet, Mouthwashing will become available on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S before the end of 2025. Physical editions of Mouthwashing PS5 and Nintendo Switch are also in the works, with preorders via Fangamer going live soon.</p><p>If you don't want to wait for Mouthwashing to come to consoles before playing it, you can buy it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2475490/Mouthwashing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$13 right now on Steam</a>.</p>
