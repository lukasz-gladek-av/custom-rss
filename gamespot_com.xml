                <p>The latest Grounded 2 patch may not be adding anything completely new to the game, but it is removing some of the survival sandbox's biggest annoyances. Patch 0.1.3 includes some improvements for the Buggy, save-repair options, and makes sure resources will no longer respawn through your structures--though players still report frequent crashes.</p><p>In what Obsidian refers to as a "quick fix" pending more major changes, Grounded 2 is getting a handful of game-repair options to remove a few annoyances. You'll now be able to use the Creature Reset option to move all creatures back to their original locations, and the Buggy Reset to send all Buggies back to the nest, no matter where they were--or what state they were in.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grounded 2 Early Access is GREAT... But Also More of the Same So Far</p>
      </div>
<p>The game now ensures that all Snail Shells will automatically despawn after 24 hours, while a separate fix stops resources from spawning in the middle of player-built structures. Obsidian notes that you will still have to get rid of resources that are currently in your base once the update is applied, but that it shouldn't return after this.</p><p>A few bugs affecting the Buggy have been cleaned up, including a duplication glitch some players have been exploiting by using the Buggy's inventory.</p><p>Obsidian also estimates the new update comes with a 30% improvement to performance, resolving a few glitches that were known to cause game crashes. However, on the topic of stability, the studio reminds players that Grounded 2 is still in early access, and that players can expect stability and performance to continue to improve through development.</p><p>The Grounded sequel launched in early access at the end of July, and quickly racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-reaches-major-player-milestone/1100-6533899/" data-ref-id="1100-6533899">over 3 million players</a>.

                <p>A much-hyped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-dress-to-impress-lady-gaga-event/1100-6534112/" data-ref-id="1100-6534112">meet and greet</a> with Lady Gaga on Roblox's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dress-to-impress/" data-ref-id="5000-682160">Dress to Impress</a> did not play out as advertised, according to fans who were not exactly impressed by the event. DTI has issued an apology, promising to "take accountability" for fans' disappointment over the meet and greet.</p><p>Fans were disappointed to discover that, while Lady Gaga was in fact present and in control of her avatar during the event, only a select few players--including devs, influencers, and contest winners--were actually able to interact with her directly. Other players only saw a broadcast version of Gaga's avatar from a different server. Fans also expressed disappointment that the Gaga Q&amp;A was purely text chat, instead of a voice broadcast.</p><p>However the biggest controversy over the event was the way feedback was handled by DTI's community team both on official channels and on their own personal socials. "None of you are forced to be here," one community manager said on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBHXhDIA7sI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube Live stream</a> of the event when reading player criticisms in the chat. "If you're unhappy just leave." The community manager, who streams as BeaPlays, issued a personal apology via DTI socials. "I should not have responded with such a lack of empathy, and that is completely on me," Bea said. "Moving forward, I will keep in mind your feedback and ensure that my responses are more appropriate and thought out."</p><p>The developers addressed other concerns with the event, explaining that it was not possible for the hundreds of thousands of players who attended the event to all personally meet Lady Gaga, and Roblox limitations also meant that live audio could not be broadcast across all the servers. "This is the first time we have done something this big, but that doesn't excuse the fact that we missed the mark," the apology reads. "In the future, we will make more of an effort to ensure that our messaging is very clear so that you know exactly what to expect."</p><p>The DTI team also explained that all questions that were given to Gaga during the Q&amp;A had to be okayed by her team in advance, meaning there wasn't much scope for spontaneity during the event. They also acknowledged that the fan event was "feeling drawn out or a little boring towards the end," but in a message on Discord added that they didn't want to rush Lady Gaga's answers.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/allurequinn/status/1959296671772254700" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">🚨LADY GAGA IS CURRENTLY TEASING DEAD DANCE ON DRESS TO IMPRESS <br>“You've created a creature of the night, now I'm haunting your air, your soul, your eyes” <a href="https://t.co/THXe2ypxyx" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/THXe2ypxyx</a></p>  — pop culture gal (@allurequinn) <a href="https://twitter.com/allurequinn/status/1959296671772254700?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>While the event wasn't exactly everything that fans had hoped it would be, Gaga used the unlikely appearance to tease her upcoming song "The Dead Dance," and even debuted some of the upcoming song's lyrics in the Dress To Impress chat.

Sony's Helldivers 2 launched today on Xbox, with Microsoft's Gears of War: Reloaded debuting on PlayStation 5.</p><p>Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-published-game-helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-in-august/1100-6532942/" data-ref-id="1100-6532942">announced that it was bringing Helldivers 2 to Xbox back in July</a>, while Microsoft's announcement of Gears of War: Reloaded in May <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">confirmed a PS5 release.</a></p><p>The launches are notable in part because of what they say about the evolving landscape for games. Microsoft has been embracing a multiplatform release strategy for some time now, and Gears is just the latest effort for Microsoft to put its games on the biggest console platform in a bid to make more money.</p><p>Microsoft previously released games like Sea of Thieves, Grounded, and Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation. In fact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-ps5-sales-charts-but-another-game-reigned-supreme/2900-6827/" data-ref-id="2900-6827">Xbox games are dominating the PlayStation sales charts</a>. There is a physical edition of Gears of War: Reloaded for PS5, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-physical-edition-for-ps5-is-only-40/1100-6532287/" data-ref-id="1100-6532287">not available on Xbox.</a></p><p>Sony's sample size is smaller, as Helldivers 2 is one of PlayStation's first releases on Xbox. The MLB The Show series is now on Xbox, but it's co-published with Major League Baseball. According to a report, it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-comments-on-deal-to-bring-mlb-the-show-21-to-xbox-and-game-pass/1100-6489820/" data-ref-id="1100-6489820">MLB's decision to put the series on Xbox (and Switch).</a> Whether or not Helldivers 2 coming to Xbox signals any kind of significant publishing policy shift from PlayStation is unknown. The company previously avoided putting its games on PC, but changed that stance--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-expects-to-earn-450-million-from-pc-games-in-next-10-months/1100-6514491/" data-ref-id="1100-6514491">made a lot of money from it.</a></p><p>Xbox senior social marketing manager Josh Stein shared a meme on social media regarding the launches of Helldivers 2 on Xbox and Gears on PlayStation.</p><p>Nintendo, for its part, does not release its own games on any rival console platforms. The Japanese gaming giant did, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-mario-wont-come-to-smartphones/1100-6410004/" data-ref-id="1100-6410004">hold out on releasing mobile games for a long time</a> before eventually kicking off a mobile-game endeavor with games like Mario Kart Tour, Super Mario Run, and Fire Emblem Heroes.</p><p>Helldivers 2 on Xbox is more than just a straight port of the game for Microsoft's console, as the game launched today, August 26, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/helldivers-2-odst-crossover-will-add-4-iconic-halo-weapons-and-more/2900-6890/" data-ref-id="2900-6890">Halo crossover</a>--and this content is available on PS5 and PC as well.</p><p>As for Gears of War Reloaded, the remaster of the 2006 original game doesn't have any special content with history connected to PlayStation. The franchise was among the best-known for Xbox in the Xbox 360 days, but is only just now making the leap to PlayStation after some 19 years.</p><p>Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski has said he is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-co-creator-is-thrilled-that-the-franchise-isnt-xbox-exclusive-anymore/1100-6534071/" data-ref-id="1100-6534071">thrilled to see Gears come to PlayStation.</a> The next entry in the series, 2026's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526145/" data-ref-id="1100-6526145">Gears of War: E-Day</a>, is so far only confirmed for release on Xbox for its console release.</p>

Each Lumines session sees players drop 2x2 blocks--which are made up of smaller squares in two different colors--onto a playing area, and by doing so, they will create larger blocks in order to score points.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556619-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556619" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556619-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556619"></a><figcaption>Lumines Arise</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556619-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556620-lumines-arise-13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556621-lumines-arise-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556622-lumines-arise-14.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556623-lumines-arise-05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556624-lumines-arise-07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556625-lumines-arise-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556626-lumines-arise-09.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556627-lumines-arise-06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556628-lumines-arise-08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556629-lumines-arise-11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556630-lumines-arise-03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556631-lumines-arise-04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556632-lumines-arise-02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556633-lumines-arise-01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556634-lumines-arise-10.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556620,1300-4556621,1300-4556622,1300-4556623,1300-4556624,1300-4556625,1300-4556626,1300-4556627,1300-4556628,1300-4556629,1300-4556630,1300-4556631,1300-4556632,1300-4556633,1300-4556634" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556620-lumines-arise-13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556621-lumines-arise-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556622-lumines-arise-14.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556623-lumines-arise-05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556624-lumines-arise-07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556625-lumines-arise-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556626-lumines-arise-09.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556627-lumines-arise-06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556628-lumines-arise-08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556629-lumines-arise-11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556630-lumines-arise-03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556631-lumines-arise-04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556632-lumines-arise-02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556633-lumines-arise-01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4556634-lumines-arise-10.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556620-lumines-arise-13.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556621-lumines-arise-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556622-lumines-arise-14.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556623-lumines-arise-05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556624-lumines-arise-07.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556625-lumines-arise-12.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556626-lumines-arise-09.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556627-lumines-arise-06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556628-lumines-arise-08.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556629-lumines-arise-11.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556630-lumines-arise-03.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556631-lumines-arise-04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556632-lumines-arise-02.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556633-lumines-arise-01.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4556634-lumines-arise-10.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A demo for Lumines Arise is available starting today on both PlayStation Network and Steam, and it will feature the first three stages of the single-player Journey mode, as well as a new multiplayer mode called Burst Battle.
