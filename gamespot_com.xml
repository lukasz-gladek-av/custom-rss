                <p>The College Football bowl season is underway, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/even-football-is-now-an-xbox-as-xbox-is-sponsoring-a-college-football-bowl-game-this-year/1100-6536706/" data-ref-id="1100-6536706">first-ever Xbox Bowl</a> took place on December 18--and what a sight it was.</p><p>Arkansas State defeated Missouri State 34-28 to claim the title. Arkansas State was up 31-7 going into the fourth, but Missouri State battled back, scoring 21 points in the fourth to make it close.</p><p>Naturally, the Xbox Bowl was full of Xbox-branded partnerships, including Master Chief doing the coin toss to start the game. Corey Rucker Jr. of Arkansas State won Offensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, earning himself an <a href="https://x.com/ESPNCFB/status/2001894073200701877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Achievement Unlocked"</a> trophy, while Kyle Taylor of Arkansas State won Defensive MVP of the Xbox Bowl, taking home a similarly styled trophy.</p><p>As for the actual trophy for the champions, Master Chief was driven to midfield in a Warthog to present Arkansas State with the trophy, which took the form of an Rog Xbox Ally strapped onto a football-shaped piece of metal with the Xbox logo on it.</p><p>Both teams also received Xbox systems in the form of the Rog Xbox Ally handheld, and you can see in the video below that players from Missouri State were pretty stoked.</p><p>The popular College Football Campus Tour, which documents obstructed views at stadiums, even reported back from the Xbox Bowl, which was held at The Ford Center in Frisco, Texas. Section 204 Row 16 and Seat 23 had only 36% field visibility, which is pretty rough, as you can tell from the image below.</p><p>Check out some additional images from the Xbox Bowl below, as shared on social media.</p>
