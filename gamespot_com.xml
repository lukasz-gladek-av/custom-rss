                <p>Despite the massive success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, the game's developer, NetEase, recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-layoffs-at-us-team-influenced-in-part-by-geopolitical-risks-analyst-says/1100-6529611/" data-ref-id="1100-6529611">laid off some of the devs who worked on it</a>. Soon after, there were reports about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">larger cuts within NetEase</a> and the developers under its umbrella. However, those cuts won't affect <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-reveals-a-medieval-world-ruled-by-vampires/1100-6528789/" data-ref-id="1100-6528789">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, the upcoming vampire game from Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz.</p><p>Tomasz Tinc, one of the co-owners of Blood of Dawnwalker's developer, Rebel Wolves, shared a message on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn account</a> to counter reports that his studio is endangered by any of the upheaval at NetEase.</p><p>"I've also read the articles suggesting that Rebel Wolves may be in danger due to the [rumored] situation at NetEase," wrote Tinc. "First and foremost, thank you for all the warm messages and wishes. The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues. The Blood of Dawnwalker's production is fully funded, and we work alongside our partners and friends from Bandai Namco, our game's global publisher, to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to life. The vast majority of Rebel Wolves' ownership rests in the hands of Konrad Tomaszkiewicz and other studio co-owners, all of whom are employed by Rebel Wolves. NetEase is Rebel Wolves' minority shareholder."</p><p>Rebel Wolves hasn't announced a release date for The Blood of Dawnwalker, but the studio has shared some details about the game itself. The story will be set in the 14th century in a small fictional European country that has been taken over by vampires. The leading character is Coen, a half-human/half-vampire hybrid who has 30 days and nights to save his family. That ticking clock means that even minor activities in Blood of Dawnwalker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">may suck away the time</a> Coen needs to finish his story.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker's gameplay reveal will be unveiled this summer. It will eventually be released on hit PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>LocalThunk has revealed that Balatro is now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, along with the fourth Friends of Jimbo pack. This pack includes collaborations with Fallout, Assassin's Creed, and more.</p><p>Friends of Jimbo packs are free updates that allow players to change the face cards of any or all suits in the deck. These have no impact on gameplay. In this most recent pack, the eight new crossovers are: Dead by Daylight, Civilization VII, Critical Role, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, Slay the Princess, and Rust.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn4ft9u924I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Xn4ft9u924I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Previous Friends of Jimbo packs included crossovers with Cyberpunk 2077, Warframe, and Stardew Valley. Balatro's inclusion onto  Game Pass is a surprise, as Microsoft already revealed the rest of the games that'll <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-is-getting-three-more-games-in-february-2025/2900-6268/" data-ref-id="2900-6268">join this month</a>, including Watch Dogs Legion, EA Sports F1 24, and Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader.</p><p>Balatro recently got its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-confusing-rating-finally-changed-leads-to-europe-changing-how-it-rates-gambling-games/1100-6529673/" data-ref-id="1100-6529673">European classification changed from PEGI 18 to PEGI 12</a> due to an appeal from the game's publisher. PEGI concluded that even though Balatro taught poker hands, its more fantastical and mystical elements mitigated the gambling aspects.</p><p>Balatro is one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/" data-ref-id="2900-6045">GameSpot's best games of 2024</a>, and it has received numerous awards and nominations at shows like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/" data-ref-id="2900-6116">2025 DICE Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/" data-ref-id="2900-6173">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-york-game-awards-2025-all-nominees/2900-6106/" data-ref-id="2900-6106">New York Game Awards 2025</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2024-winners-revealed/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>.</p>
