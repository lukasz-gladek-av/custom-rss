          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Players have discovered the information <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> gives about the stats of its character and karts isn't entirely true, as testing certain combinations of characters and vehicles have produced some surprising results.</p><p>Just as in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8</a>, Mario Kart World displays basic character and kart information like top speed, acceleration, weight, and handling. These stats are affected by the size of the characters, which are categorized into different unofficial weight classes. Extremely small or light characters, like all of the game's baby characters as well as some others, will have higher acceleration and lower top speeds, while heavy characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong will have higher top speeds but lower acceleration. The game doesn't tell players this outright, but it can be gleaned by selecting the same kart with different characters and seeing how the stat graph changes or stays the same.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_j7KZJbAbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_j7KZJbAbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>However, there are seemingly even more hidden stats that the game doesn't tell players about. As highlighted in a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@svcTyler" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">svcTyler</a> on YouTube, it appears some character and kart combinations are simply better than others in specific situations, despite the in-game stat graph showing that they should be identical. According to the video, certain characters and karts secretly perform better on certain types of terrain. Wario, for example, goes faster on paved tracks, while characters like Cow go faster on dirt roads. That means even though Wario and Waluigi are in same weight class, and even if they use the same kart, Wario will always be faster when driving on a normal road.</p><p>Since Nintendo is unlikely to ever give players the data they want outright, more testing will need to be done in the days and weeks ahead to learn which characters and karts excel in which situations. It's a fascinating revelation that adds an interesting wrinkle when it comes to selecting what character and kart to use, as the answer to what is best will depend on the track you're racing on. The question still remains why Nintendo doesn't just put all this secret information in-game for everyone to see, but at least it gives hardcore Mario Kart World players something to pursue in their quest for top times.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World review</a>, we said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch game</a> expands on almost everything that made Mario Kart 8 such a success, providing a "fun and rewarding kart racing experience that's easy to understand" while still providing "enough mechanical nuance to reward veteran kart racers."</p><p>Secret character stats aren't the only thing Mario Kart World doesn't tell players. It also doesn't disclose <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/" data-ref-id="1100-6532291">how to unlock Mirror Mode</a> or that you can actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">dodge Blue Shells using the game's new rewind feature</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>PvP is a big part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's newly released survival MMO based on Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi series, and some players have already found a busted strategy that the developers are looking to fix "ASAP."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening released on June 5 for those who paid for the game's pricier editions (or June 10 for everyone else), and some players have already reached its PvP-focused endgame--the Deep Desert. It's there where the game's most precious resource, Spice, is found, and where players duke it out in large-scale PvP to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">As some players have learned the hard way, however, coming out on top can be quite literal, as a new meta involving the game's flying Ornithopter vehicles is seeing helpless players crushed from above over and over again. One player took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dune: Awakening subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and posted a video of their plight. The video shows user Bombe18 repeatedly crushed by an Ornithopter crashing into the ground. Every time Bombe18 self-revives, they are crushed again, and soon a second Ornithopter shows up to make Bombe18's life even more miserable.</p><p dir="ltr">The video prompted a response from Funcom's Joel Bylos, who responded to the video by stating "Sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP." Bylos didn't go into more detail on what exactly the fix would entail, but players on Reddit seem to agree that Ornithopters should be taking damage from ramming into the ground at high speeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening does give players tools to deal with vehicles, such as explosive weaponry. Players being divebombed by Ornithopters could also use a vehicle of their own to try and escape or hit back. That being said, flying vehicles able to crash into the ground with no concern for their own well-being does seem like an issue that needs to be addressed, so it's good to see Funcom is paying close attention.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to do their own Ornithopter diving runs, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">Dune: Awakening guide on how to unlock and craft vehicles</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-beginner-tips-to-help-you-survive-arrakis-in-dune-awakening/2900-6645/" data-ref-id="2900-6645">beginner tips for surviving on Arrakis</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">A new update has arrived to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>. The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner. We’ve got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all Griefs more impactful. Until then, jump in and let us know how these changes are feeling once you’ve gotten a few matches under your belt.</p><p>P.S.: For those unaware, each victory in a Capture Zone awards that team 2,000 Essence, so get on it!</p><ul><li>Enemy-based melee damage against players now escalates faster than Standard Zombies modes.  <ul><li>Starting at Round 1, enemies will do increased melee damage (1.5x) in Grief.</li><li>Enemy melee damage will continue to scale to a maximum scalar (4x) after round 20.</li></ul></li><li>Increased GobbleGum machine cooldown to 5 minutes.</li><li>Salvage pickup value reduced from 100 to 50.</li><li>Self-Revive crafting limit reduced to 1 per player.</li><li>Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection Support items can no longer drop from Special or Elite enemies.</li><li>AFK players are now kicked after 60 seconds of inactivity.</li></ul><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>AS VAL</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue that prevented players from viewing Barrel attachments for the AS VAL.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><b>UI </b></h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the player’s Equipment and Field Upgrade HUD elements could appear grayed-out when another player activated Mutant Injection.</li></ul><h3>Stability</h3><ul><li>Addressed various stability issues.</li></ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>

                <p>There's no shortage of mobile controllers that turn your smartphone or small tablet into dedicated handhelds not unlike the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck. But what about players who game on larger tablets, including 13-inch iPad Pro models? Well, now they can turn their iPad into a <em>giant </em>handheld gaming machine with the Razer <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-Android-Tablets-Smartphone/dp/B0DVKWZ5SX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kishi V3 Pro XL</a></strong>.

It connects via USB-C and has an additional USB-C port for passthrough charging. Razer upgraded some of the components to offer a more premium experience than its previous V2 Pro and Ultra models of the Kishi.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger pulls are registered by Hall Effect sensors, but the full-sized thumbsticks are fitted with TMR sensors (Tunnel Magnetoresistance).

The Kishi V3 Pro models are the first dedicated mobile controllers from a major manufacturer to utilize TMR sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL has two remappable back buttons and a pair of extra shoulder buttons geared toward claw-grip players. It has Razer's mecha-tactile face buttons and an 8-way D-pad activated by microswitches. Both handles are shaped like traditional controller grips, and each one has a rumble motor with Sensa HD Haptics, Razer's proprietary rumble system designed to increase immersion--it's the same general idea as Nintendo's HD Rumble and PlayStation's DualSense haptics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Kishi controllers support Razer's Nexus App, a game launcher for native iOS and Android games, as well as Razer PC Remote Play. If you have an iPad with powerful enough specs--M1 or better is recommended--you could use the new Kishi V3 Pro XL to play a few of the AAA games that have been ported to Apple platforms, including Death Stranding and multiple Resident Evil games, on a giant Nintendo Switch-like handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL includes a six-month subscription to Apple Arcade for new and eligible returning subscribers.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro for Phones &amp; Tablets up to 8"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kishi V3 Pro has the same tech as the XL model, just geared toward smaller mobile devices.

It doesn't have the claw-grip bumpers or Sensa HD Haptics, and the face buttons and D-pad don't have the mouse-click feel and feedback. The four-way D-pad and buttons are "Quiet-tactile," which is likely a fancy way to say they feel conventional.</p><p>The Kishi V3 should fit most Android smartphones thanks to its "island" design and thicker depth clearance, and it also comes with three months of Apple Arcade for free.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Razer isn't the only player in this game, as GameSir offers its own controller cradle for tablets.

This one syncs via Bluetooth and supports iOS and Android devices up to 8.5 inches. It's also compatible with Nintendo Switch and the new Switch 2, which is a big perk.</p><p>Smartphone owners can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/" data-ref-id="1100-6531316">check out the new Backbone Pro</a>, which offers a pro-style setup to mobile gaming. Building off of the foundation established by the Backbone One, this snap-on USB-C controller for iPhone 15/16 and Android phones is an impressive upgrade compared to its predecessor.</p><p>You can also use it as a wireless Bluetooth controller on tablets, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and more devices, and it's highly customizable via the official Backbone App. Overall, this is a comfier and feature-packed successor to the Backbone One. Like Razer's V3 Pro controllers, the Backbone Pro is pricier than many mobile controllers at $170.</p><hr>

                <p>Amazon is currently offering discounts on select gaming chairs, including a few models with high-end features like built-in speakers, footrests, and additional lumbar support. Inventory is limited, and because some models are <strong>on sale at their lowest prices ever</strong>, they’re bound to sell out fast. Unfortunately, these chairs won’t ship in time for Father’s Day, but if you’re shopping for yourself (or someone patient), now is a great time to scoop up a budget gaming chair at a great low price.</p><div title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3692" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest (Ocean Blue)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $180)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the best price ever for the GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest.

Crafted with a soft cloth material that helps airflow and disperses heat, it’s a nice alternative to the many leather chairs on the market. This black edition also features grey accents along the edges and a stitched backrest that appears more premium than its price would suggest. Beyond that, you’re getting many of the standard gaming chair features--including a 165-degree reclining angle, a wide seat, and a weight capacity up to 300 pounds.

(was $170)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Puma Active Gaming Chair is more like a rocker than a desk chair, making it better suited for console gaming. You can lounge back in the seat or sit upright, but it’s too small for a typical PC gaming desk setup. Instead, you can toss it on the floor next to your big-screen TV. Featuring pockets for your accessories and a rocking base with rubber grips for added stability, it’s a pretty cool choice at this new low price.
