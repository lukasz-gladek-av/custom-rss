Developer Team Jade has revealed that 10-year bans--yes, a full decade--have been handed out recently to over 1,000 players for violating rules of the tactical shooter. The preventative measures don't stop there, either.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the official Delta Force account shared statistics on how the developer is dealing with cheaters. From March 14-20, the game's security team said that 1,446 players were banned, 694 devices blocked, and more than 4,000 people forced offline. <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/detail.html?father_content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521&amp;content_id=80169c48a4720a450cab07aa9781d08ca521" rel="nofollow ">The Delta Force website</a> notes that cheating can consist of "the use of plug-ins, illegal software, inappropriate behaviour, malicious use of exploits or bugs, etc." The developer also mentions a zero-tolerance policy, which checks out considering over 7,000 decade bans <a href="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1877883126686577103" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">were dished out</a> for Season Genesis in January.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DeltaForce_Game/status/1902666885906469042" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Our G.T.I.

This add-on is actually a remake of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/delta-force-black-hawk-down-review/1900-6023896/">the 2003 game</a> of the same name. It's inspired by the Hollywood movie based on a real event that occurred in 1993, with the game featuring the Battle of Mogadishu. Meanwhile, the Warfare mode offers up 32-vs.-32 online multiplayer in the tactical shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Delta Force launched on PC in December and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-indiana-jones-and-more-land-on-steams-top-titles-for-december/2900-6177/#1">landed on Steam's top titles for that month</a>, alongside Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. The free-to-play game has seemingly maintained a healthy player base as well, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2507950/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> showing over 52,000 concurrent players for Delta Force at the time of publication.</p><p dir="ltr">The tactical shooter is scheduled to get a mobile release on April 21.
