                <p>Another <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/war-thunder/" data-ref-id="5000-109288">War Thunder</a> player has been banned because they leaked classified military info on the game's official forums, and this isn't the first time it has happened.</p><p>The <a href="https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/classified-data-once-again-leaked-on-war-thunder-forums/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UK Defense Journal</a> reported this latest ban, explaining that a player had uploaded a NATOPS (Naval Air Training and Operating Procedures Standardization) manual that was not approved for public release. The specific section of the manual uploaded discusses the AV-8B and TAV-8B Harriers, two aircraft used by the United States' Navy and Marine Corps. Once this document was posted, War Thunder's community managed removed the post and temporarily banned the user.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519984" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519984"></a><figcaption>An in-game image of the AV-8B Harrier, one of the aircraft in this latest leak.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4519984-warthunderleak.jpg"></figure><p>Leaks like this are not unheard of within War Thunder's community. It's a free-to-play multiplayer military game that allows players to use real-life military aircraft, naval vessels, and vehicles. As a result, it attracts players who are knowledgeable about what's featured in the game. </p><p>GameSpot has reported on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classified-military-documents-leaked-by-war-thunder-players-for-the-third-time/1100-6504128/" data-ref-id="1100-6504128">similar War Thunder leaks</a> in the past. The UK Defense Journal estimates that this has happened at least nine times in War Thunder alone. It's definitely a moderation challenge for the community managers of War Thunder, but one they seem quite experienced at handling at this point.</p><p>If you want to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/war-thunder-review/1900-6415815/" data-ref-id="1900-6415815">War Thunder</a> for yourself, it's available on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Android.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's Xbox division is facing more layoffs soon. That's according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MDc3Mjc0NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxMzc3NTQ2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWUQ0VkxEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iMkVuxzB6m6hT_Rpwa-NQCTCvDapSt1DaRfpnGaqUSw&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, which said "major" layoffs at Xbox could be announced next week.</p><p>This would be just the latest round of cuts at Xbox, following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">1,900+ layoffs after the Activision Blizzard deal closed</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">hundreds more job reductions after that.</a> These cuts, and the ones reportedly planned to be announced next week, are believed to be part of a wider cost-cutting program at Microsoft that has resulted in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-10000-people-cuts-reportedly-include-xbox-and-bethesda/1100-6510650/" data-ref-id="1100-6510650">many thousands of layoffs over the past two years.</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1937510927068283311" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge reported earlier this month</a> that Xbox would face more layoffs at the end of June.

SpongeBob's typical look didn't have to change much, as it ports well into Dice of Destiny. Katara, meanwhile, has been reimagined as a shorter, squishier character to suit the game's aesthetic, much like how the game handles Leonardo, the Ninja Turtle, who is also making his way to the family game as seen below.</p><h2>Katara's abilities</h2><p>The waterbender naturally has a host of water-based abilities that will deal damage to enemies and/or heal allies, making Katara a reliable support character for your Nicktoons party.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4518407-nicktoons-dod_character_sheet_katara_16x9%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4518407-nicktoons-dod_character_sheet_katara_16x9%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4518407"></a><figcaption>Katara's ability kit in Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4518407-nicktoons-dod_character_sheet_katara_16x9%281%29.jpg"></figure><ul><li><strong>Water Whip</strong> - Whips enemies with water, restoring her mana in the process.

                <p>Video game development veteran Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said the current model of large-scale game development is "becoming unsustainable."</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITMedia </a>as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work."</p><p>Sakurai added that independent game developers are facing challenges, too. He said indie developers "need a lot of luck, effort, polish, and stand-out elements to succeed in the market."</p><p>The developer went on to say that he sees generative AI as a possible solution to help developers, especially teams that make large-scale games.</p><p>"The only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive," he said.</p><p>Sakurai mainly makes games for Nintendo, but his company, Sora Ltd., is not owned by the gaming giant. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has said he believes AI will play a role in the future of gaming, but the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-talks-ai-amid-concerns-of-job-cuts-there-will-always-be-a-human-touch/1100-6530667/" data-ref-id="1100-6530667">"human touch" will always be necessary to make great games.</a></p><p>Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Sakurai is not the first person to question the sustainability of the AAA landscape, as former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">beating that drum for years.</a> As for the role new AI systems can play in the future of game development, it remains to be seen how it will shake out, but developers are already using such tools to speed up development. EA Sports said this week that it created a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"newly upgraded machine- learning-based pipeline"</a> to speed up development on CFB 26. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of video game developers worldwide were using AI tools to make games</a>, despite ongoing concerns from workers.</p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p>
