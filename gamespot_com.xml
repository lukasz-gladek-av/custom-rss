But in the newly revealed WWE 2K25 season pass, that lineup is going to get even better.</p><p>NXT wrestlers Giulia, Stephanie Vaquer, as well as the Motor City Machine Guns, Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin, will be the first new arrivals in the New Wave Pack. Penta, the recently arrived luchador from AEW, will be added in a later pack, and he's not the only former All Elite Wrestling veteran on the way. Billy Gunn will be making his WWE return alongside his New Age Outlaws teammate, Road Dogg, and so is "the world's strongest man," Mark Henry.</p><p>The final wave of DLC characters will be a blast from the past, the 1980s, to be specific. For the first time in a WWE video game, Jesse "The Body" Ventura will be available alongside Paul "Mr. Wonderful" Orndorff, Junk Yard Dog, Tito Santana, and Sid Justice... whom long-time wrestling fans may remember as both Sid Vicious and Sycho Sid.</p><p>There are a few guest characters whose names have yet to be released, including two "special celebrity guests" and three NBA players. The complete lineup of DLC packs is below, along with the release windows.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4454676-wwe2k25seasonpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454676" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4454676-wwe2k25seasonpass.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454676"></a><figcaption>Some of the wrestlers included with WWE 2K25's season pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4454676-wwe2k25seasonpass.jpg"></figure><h3>New Wave Pack - May 2025</h3><ul><li>Alex Shelley</li><li>Chris Sabin</li><li>Giulia</li><li>Stephanie Vaquer</li><li>Special celebrity guest to be announced</li></ul><h3>Dunk &amp; Destruction Pack - June 2025</h3><ul><li>Abyss</li><li>Great Khali</li><li>Three NBA stars to be announced</li></ul><h3>Fearless Pack - July 2025</h3><ul><li>New Jack</li><li>Jordynne Grace</li><li>Penta</li><li>Bull Nakano</li><li>Special celebrity guest to be announced</li></ul><h3>Attitude Era Superstars Pack - September 2025</h3><ul><li>D’Lo Brown</li><li>Billy Gunn</li><li>Road Dogg</li><li>Victoria</li><li>Mark Henry</li></ul><h3>Saturday Night’s Main Event Pack - November 2025</h3><ul><li>Jesse Ventura</li><li>Mr. Wonderful</li><li>Tito Santana</li><li>Junk Yard Dog</li><li>Sid Justice</li></ul><p>The WWE 2K25 season pass will be included in the Undertaker-centric Deadman Edition or in The Bloodline Edition, which will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k25s-showcase-mode-will-let-you-relive-and-change-bloodline-history/1100-6529612/" data-ref-id="1100-6529612">let players rewrite history</a> for some of the Bloodline's most memorable matches.

                <p>NordVPN is running a limited-time discount that saves you 70% on its two-year subscription plans. Four different plans are available for NordVPN--Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime. Each one is more expensive than the last, but all four are currently on sale. You’ll get the best deal when signing up for its most expensive package, Prime, which is down to $201.36 for 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months), but even the standard <strong>Basic plan is a great deal at just $81.36 for 24 months (was $278.16)</strong>. As a bonus, <strong>signing up for a two-year deal on the Plus or Complete plans will get you an additional six months for free</strong> via an emailed coupon code. Opt for the Prime plan, and this gets bumped to one year. You can use the code to extend your plan or gift it to a friend and get them some free added privacy or a way to access the catalog of other countries’ streaming services.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the costs of each two-year plan:</p><h2>NordVPN Plans</h2><ul><li>Basic -- $81.36 (<del>$278.16</del>)</li><li>Plus --$105.58 (<del>$359.76</del>)</li><li>Complete -- $129.36 (<del>$438.96</del>)</li><li>Prime -- $201.36 (<del>$743.76</del>)</li></ul><p>All four plans get you access to the secure NordVPN network and threat protection through its DNS servers. They also support 10 simultaneous connections, so you should have no problem running all your favorite gadgets through the VPN at once.</p><p>Stepping up to the Plus plan introduces perks like ad and tracker blockers, advanced browsing protection, and anti-malware protection. There’s even a password manager that works across all your devices automatically.</p><p>The Complete plan provides 1TB of encrypted cloud storage--for an extra $24, that’s not a bad offer. Prime is the most comprehensive plan offered by NordVPN, getting you NordProtect--an identity protection service that scans the dark web for your data, offers credit freeze assistance, and even provides you with up to $1 million in identity theft coverage.</p><p>NordVPN is a pretty popular service, and getting access to it at these low prices is mighty enticing. And since three of the four plans get you additional months for free, it’s a great time to sign up.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

Next month, Black will add another one to his resume when he plays Steve in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-director-explains-why-it-isnt-called-the-minecraft-movie/1100-6527977/" data-ref-id="1100-6527977">A Minecraft Movie</a>. Now, a Minecraft modder has added Black's voice to the game that spawned the film.</p><p>A modder going by SnailMan posted a clip of the mod they created, which essentially places Black's incarnation of Steve into the world of Minecraft. The modder also jokingly wrote that creating this mod was "[three] hours of my life that I'll never get back."</p><p>Considering that the movie isn't out yet, SnailMan could only rely on the clips of Black from the trailers and TV spots for A Minecraft Movie. But that was enough for at least a few more lines to be entered into the game.</p><p>The Jack Black Minecraft mod isn't available yet, but SnailMan indicated that it is currently under review at Modrinth. When it does go live, players can find it at <a href="https://modrinth.com/user/SnailMan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SnailMan's Modrinth page</a>.</p><p>As part of Mattel's A Minecraft Movie toys, there will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mattels-official-minecraft-movie-toys-are-available-at-amazon/1100-6529729/" data-ref-id="1100-6529729">a Jack Black as Steve action figure</a>.

To see the resolution of that conflict, fans will have to wait until A Minecraft Movie hits theaters on April 4.</p>

                <p>You're probably wondering why Focus Mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a> is a bit finicky. As you take on numerous gargantuan beasts, this mechanic is one that enables you to track targets and land devastating blows. However, making use of it is a bit cumbersome... at least until you make a small tweak to the controls. Our guide tells you just what you need to do to alleviate combat-induced migraines in your playthrough.</p><h2>How to make combat easier with the Focus Mode toggle in Monster Hunter Wilds </h2><p>Focus Mode is a game mechanic that's supposed to make combat easier. First, it requires you to hold the button prompt--i.e. L2/LT on a gamepad, Left Alt on a keyboard, or the Mouse 4 button on a mouse. This lets you aim and track a target as it moves around the area.</p><p>More importantly, it makes wounds easier to discern. When you repeatedly hit a monster's body parts, these wounds appear as bright red gashes while Focus Mode is active. Then, when you press the button prompt for a Focus Strike, your character will perform a devastating blow.</p><p>Unfortunately, the system itself is quite cumbersome to use. Imagine having to hold down a button most of the time throughout a fight, all while switching between items and dodging blows, and the whole thing turns into quite a hassle. Worse, certain armaments, such as the bow--which we consider one of the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-weapons-in-monster-hunter-wilds/2900-6288/" data-ref-id="2900-6288">best weapons</a></strong> in the game--become unwieldy since you have to alternate between two ability sets/firing modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003"></a><figcaption>Focus Mode needs to be active if you want to spot a creature's wounds.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg"></figure><p>Fortunately, there's a quick fix for Monster Hunter Wilds' Focus Mode. All you need to do is open the menu and go to the Options screen. Take a look at the Controls tab and go to page 2. You should see the following:</p><ul><li>Aim/Focus Mode Controls  <ul><li>Melee Weapons</li><li>Ranged Weapons</li></ul></li><li>The default setting is "Activate Mode," but you should change it to "Toggle Mode."</li><li>You can switch to Toggle Mode for either melee or ranged weapons, or both, depending on your control preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004"></a><figcaption>Switching Focus Mode to activate when toggled makes controls less cumbersome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg"></figure><p>With this tweak, you simply need to press the Focus Mode button/keybind. As long as your weapon is drawn, Focus Mode will remain active and you won't have to hold the button down anymore. If you want to deactivate it, just press the same button or sheathe your weapon to disengage swiftly.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to use the toggle for Focus Mode in Monster Hunter Wilds.
