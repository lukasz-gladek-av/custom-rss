                <p>After paying college athletes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">$600 to appear in College Football 25</a>, EA will pay players more than double that for this year's CFB 26. EA Sports confirmed to FBS players in an email today, obtained by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, stating that players will get $1,500 if they opt in to appear in this year's game. This is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">this information leaked earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Additionally, players will receive a Deluxe Edition copy of the game--this was also offered in 2025. EA will pay some athletes more for appearing as brand ambassadors, just like last year.</p><p>A spokesperson for EA said, "College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in College Football 26 and beyond."</p><p>More than 11,000 student-athletes appeared in CFB 25 through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals, with EA spending more than $6 million to cover that. A spokesperson told The Athletic that EA will double its payment to players to more than $16.5 million to help them feel recognized for the success of CFB 25. Of note, the $16.5 million figure reportedly does not include any further payments to certain players who have ambassador deals or for further payments to cover athletes. </p><p>That game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game of 2024 overall in the US</a>, only surpassed by Black Ops 6. CFB 25 was the <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/12/18/Unpacks/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-video-game-all-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">best-selling sports video game in US history based on dollar sales.</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/FOS/status/1902076294780624967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Front Office Sports</a>, EA is also potentially going to negotiate royalty-based payments for certain players on top of the $1,500 appearance fee.</p><p>CFB 26 is in the works now and is expected to launch in July. EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p>

                <p>Anyone who has played an online game has probably encountered a bot at some point that may have negatively impacted their gaming experience. To help address gaming's bot problem, Razer and OpenAI founder Sam Altman's company World have <a href="https://press.razer.com/company-news/razer-and-world-team-up-to-combat-third-party-bots-in-online-games-in-the-age-of-ai-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">teamed up</a> to create what's called "Razer ID verified by World AI."</p><p>It's a new single sign-on (SSO) proof-of-human system that verifies if a player is a human or a bot. If it all goes to plan, it will create a situation where anyone using a Razer ID account will be verified as a human, which could in turn help bolster "trust and security in the digital space," Razer said.</p><p>"Fair play starts with real players, and Razer ID's ability to integrate into games to enable 'human-only' gameplay modes is key to fostering fair competition and a more trusted gaming environment," the company stated.</p><p>Numerous games are negatively impacted by bots, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/team-fortress-2-hit-with-thousands-of-negative-steam-reviews-protesting-bot-issues/1100-6523926/" data-ref-id="1100-6523926">including Team Fortress 2</a>. Steps have been taken to address the issues, but on some level, the problems persist in that game and others. </p><p>Players need a verified <a href="https://world.org/faqs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">World ID account</a> for all of this, and that involves scanning their passport or visiting an <a href="https://world.org/find-orb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orb location in the real world</a> to have your faced scanned to create a unique iris code.</p><p>The SSO will come to life first in the futuristic blockchain video game Tokyo Beast. The game utilizes NFTs, which makes it a prime candidate for potential bot spam. Take a look at the video below to learn more about how the new system will work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ficNZwDYy8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6ficNZwDYy8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Razer chief corporate officer Wei-Pin Choo said, "To foster fair competition, developers must be able to build trusted, human-only game experiences that keep AI bots out."</p><p>World, which was founded by Altman and Alex Blania, is a technology company that anonymously confirms a person's identity while claiming to ensure their privacy.</p>

                <p>Baldur's Gate 3 was a colossal hit for Larian Studios, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">Larian walking away from the franchise</a>, toy juggernaut Hasbro is picking up the sword and shield and journeying on. Hasbro, which also owns all things Dungeons and Dragons, announced recently that the future of Baldur's Gate will be announced fairly soon, but not even a hint of what's to come.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Hasbro digital games SVP Dan Ayoub confirmed during this week's Game Developers Conference that there are plans for Baldur's Gate and that there's a lot of interest in the potential of the franchise.</p><p>"We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that," he said. Making sure games like Baldur's Gate remain relevant aligns with what Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-magic-the-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons-video-games-are-on-the-way/1100-6527911/" data-ref-id="1100-6527911">back in November</a> of last year.</p><p>At the time, Cocks stated that there will be more Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons video games on the way. Could this also mean Baldur's Gate 4 included in the grand scheme of things? Ayoub certainly feels that it's inevitable, but nothing is in the works yet.</p><p>"It's somewhat of an unenviable position," he continued. "I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach. We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that."</p><p>The final patch for Baldur's Gate 3 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-now-live-will-test-cross-play-and-split-screen-co-op/1100-6529081/" data-ref-id="1100-6529081">arrived in January</a> and included--finally--cross-play and 12 new subclasses. </p>
