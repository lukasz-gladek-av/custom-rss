                <p>Amazon has revealed the dates for this year's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day sales event</a>. The 2025 iteration of the massive sale for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime members</a> kicks off July 8 and runs through July 11. The four-day window makes it the longest Prime Day sale yet. As the name suggests, Prime Day debuted as a 24-hour flash sale in 2015 before moving to a two-day structure in 2019. And now the sales event has doubled in size once again for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Amazon Prime Day 2025</a>.</p><h2>Amazon Prime Day 2025 Start/End Times</h2><p>Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially begins on Tuesday, July 8, at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. The sales event will run for a full 96 hours, ending on July 12 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET.</p><p>That said, Amazon offers early Prime Day deals in the lead-up to Prime Day every year. And depending on sale plans from other retailers, Prime Day-esque deals will likely be available on Monday, July 7, or even the weekend prior to the event. Amazon has a tendency to match competitors in the gaming, tech, and entertainment spaces.</p><hr><h2>Prime Day 2025 Deals: What to Expect</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515463"></a><figcaption>Amazon Prime Day 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515463-primeday2025.jpg"></figure><p>So, Prime Day 2025 is twice as long, does that mean twice as many deals? Probably not, no. It's more likely that the lengthened window just gives customers more time to shop. It also formalizes what has, in practice, been true for years at this point: Amazon Prime Day was already a week-long sales event.</p><p>Not officially, but with the plethora of early deals and so-called "anti-Prime Day" sales from competing retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, the annual summer sale has become Black Friday in July over the past few years.</p><h2><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime Day 2025 Early Deals</a></h2><p>Amazon has already started offering some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">early deals for Prime members</a>. Official early Prime Day deals, just like deals during the event, are exclusive to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Prime members</a>. Amazon Prime costs $15/month or $139 per year. New subscribers can get a 30-day trial that can be canceled at any time. Young adults (ages 18-24) and students can subscribe for $7.49/month, and if you're new to Prime, the no-cost trial is extended to six months.</p><hr><p>Prime Day is generally the best time of the year to buy many Amazon-branded electronics, including Fire TV Sticks, Echo Dots, and Kindle ereaders. Amazon's early deals frequently include these devices and others. For instance, Amazon already has an awesome deal on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> that drops the price to only $20. Fire TV Stick deals are currently available to non-Prime members, but the various 4K Amazon Fire Smart TVs that are on sale are exclusive to members. Here's a quick look at some notable Amazon device deals.</p><ul><li><strong>Amazon Streaming Device Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-hd/dp/B0CQMRKRV5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick HD</a> -- $20 (<del>$35</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/dp/B0CJM1GNFQ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K</a> -- $30 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> -- $40 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/dp/B09BZZ3MM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fire TV Cube 4K</a> -- $100 (<del>$140</del>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Amazon Fire Smart TV Deals:</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">32" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $110 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-32-inch-2-series-hd-smart-tv/dp/B0CJCYMBZJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">40" 2-Series HD Smart TV</a> -- $170 (<del>$250</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0B3GTSQ9Q?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">50" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $280 (<del>$450</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B0CZBS9GKV?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" 4-Series 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$460</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-55-inch-omni-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni 4K Smart TV</a> -- $340 (<del>$550</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6ZRH6C?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">55" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $365 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B0BJMGB9RN?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">65" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $450 (<del>$720</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-65-inch-omni-qled-series-smart-tv/dp/B09N6Y5BTL?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">75" Omni QLED 4K Smart TV</a> -- $570 (<del>$1,100</del>)</li></ul></li></ul><hr><h2>Prime Day Gaming Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515451"></a><figcaption>Amazon Luna Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4515451-amazonlunacontroller.jpg"></figure><p>As part of its early <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B07P989QTJ,B08KT9XY9Z,B0B2BZWGRK&amp;tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Day gaming deals</a>, Amazon is selling its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Luna-Controller/dp/B07P989QTJ?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Luna Wireless Controller for only $40 (was $70)</a>. Though initially designed with Luna cloud gaming in mind, this Bluetooth controller is a pretty great gamepad for general use on PC, Mac, iOS, and Android devices. It's reminiscent of the Switch Pro Controller (the first one). You can also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KT9XY9Z?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundle the Luna Controller with a phone clip</a> for mobile gaming for $50.

The freebies, which can be redeemed at the Epic Games Store, GOG, Microsoft Store, Amazon's own Games App, and other digital storefronts, are arguably worth the price of a membership alone.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to Prime Day, Amazon typically gives away even more free games on top of the monthly offers. That's the case this year, too. Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, Prime members can claim six free PC games, five of which are DRM-free GOG games.</p><p>Here's the full list of freebies going live today, but Prime members should also make sure they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-prime-members-get-these-9-free-games-in-june/1100-6531806/" data-ref-id="1100-6531806">claim the monthly free games for June</a>, too.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Game</th><th scope="col">Unlock time</th><th scope="col">Storefront/License</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>Amazon Games App</td></tr><tr><td>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row 2</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>TOEM</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr><tr><td>Star Wars: Rebellion</td><td>June 17 at 9 AM PT</td><td>GOG</td></tr></tbody></table><hr><h2>Can I still get deals without Amazon Prime?</h2><p><em>Technically</em>, Prime Day deals are exclusive to members. In practice, however, there are <em>many </em>deals each year that don't require a membership. These deals are mainly the ones Amazon is price-matching to compete with Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and other major retailers. These sorts of deals are fairly common for gaming and tech products, but there are still thousands of deals that are locked behind the membership each year.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-carries-nintendo-games-again-including-new-switch-2-exclusives/1100-6532451/">Amazon Carries Nintendo Games Again, Including New Switch 2 Exclusives</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Marvel's Spider-Man Magic: The Gathering Preorders Restocked At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-bogo-50-off-movie-sale-includes-brand-new-4k-blu-ray-steelbooks-box-sets/1100-6529351/">Amazon BOGO 50% Off Movie Sale Includes Brand-New 4K Steelbooks &amp; Box Sets</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>   </ul> </div>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">The souls-like genre has become the flavor-of-the-industry in recent years, thanks to games like Elden Ring and the namesake Dark Souls becoming massively successful. Nowadays, in order to stand out in this highly competitive space, a game needs some sort of engaging hook to reel players away from other titles--be it a gameplay mechanic, overarching story, or unique visual style.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted--the latest from Guacamelee developer Drinkbox--is attempting to lure souls-like fans into its desolate world with all three of those elements, and the result is shaping up to be another hit under the Drinkbox banner. While at its core, it feels familiar to what players will expect, Blighted's unique attributes waste no time in shining through, and after my time with the game at Summer Game Fest, I expect souls-like fans will have another incredible experience to sink their teeth into come 2026.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGU-7zvoNfU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OGU-7zvoNfU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">For those who missed the trailer at SGF Live, Blighted is an isometric action-RPG with combat similar to other souls-like games--slashing, dodging, and parrying are key to victory. It is set in a world befallen by Blight, a plague that alters reality itself. Before the Blight, the people of this world would plant a seed in the brain of those who passed away, and when a Memory Tree grew from that seed, the people would eat the fruit from the tree and gain the deceased person's memories.</p><p dir="ltr">However, a sinister being named Sorcisto found that by eating the brain directly, he would gain overwhelming power and knowledge. Sorcisto then consumed the brains of all the dead he could find, setting the Blight into the world and becoming the malevolent demon the player sets out to defeat.</p><p dir="ltr">As the player defeats boss monsters, they too must devour the brains of the conquered, which then threatens to make Sorcisto's methods cyclical instead of a one-off aberration. That sort of overarching threat, and the way the game presents the ever-building Blight in the player character after defeating a boss in the demo, is teasing a story that could turn out to be one of the best the genre has ever seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat is probably the most "normal" thing in the Blighted demo when it comes to souls-likes, but by creating a familiar system for new players to jump into, Drinkbox simply isn't fixing what isn't broken. Battles with enemies are tense affairs, marked by the ability to dodge, parry, and find openings for attacks--all hallmarks of what makes these types of games so beloved.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting, despite that familiarity, felt really good; parrying attacks and turning the parry into a damaging counterattack was as satisfying here as it ever is in other games of the ilk. The boss battle--a fight against a giant spider-like creature with a horse's head--drove these points further, as watching the spider-horse-thing hit the ground after a well-timed parry was immensely satisfying.</p><p dir="ltr">Better still, I didn't have to play the game solo, either, as the developer walking me through the game also revealed Blighted's co-op features--which means those who struggle with souls-likes (like me) can bring a friend to help right from the jump. Having the dev with me on the journey allowed me to get my bearings faster, and in turn, upped my enjoyment of the demo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514694"></a><figcaption>Blighted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514694-screenshot3.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514696,1300-4514697,1300-4514698,1300-4514701,1300-4514702,1300-4514703,1300-4514704" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514696-screenshot2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514697-screenshot3.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514698-screenshot4.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514701-screenshot7.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514702-screenshot8.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514703-screenshot9.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4514704-screenshot10.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite the combat being familiar, Blighted also presents a unique mechanic with a ton of promise: The concept of Blight itself. On-screen at all times is a "Blight meter," which rises and falls depending on your performance in the game. The more Blight I had stored, the harder the game became; when I died and had to restart, I lost some of my Blight meter, which lowered the difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">By tying the game's difficulty directly to the player's performance, Blighted ingeniously sidesteps one of the souls-like's genre definite debates: How <em>hard</em> should the game be? Here, the answer is "as hard as you make it by your ability to play it," which places the onus on the <em>player</em>; it's a system that, should it pan out in the final release, could be the next major step in the souls-like genre as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">My brief demo offered only a snapshot of the Blight system in action--I could see the meter rise and fall with my actions, but I didn't notice any tangible change to enemy strength or any other difficulty indicators. That said, the idea still holds a ton of promise, even if it'll take some more time to truly feel its effects.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Blighted is set in a world with a visual style that seems to be at war with itself. The vestiges of the fallen civilization--colorful buildings, extravagant murals, and more--are all besieged with darkness and rot thanks to the Blight, creating an interesting visual dynamic. Each world I walked into during my time in the demo told its own story, and all of it led back to Sorcisto, the demon who tried to forsake the tried-and-true traditions of his fellow man--and ruined an entire population in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">Drinkbox is definitely onto something with Blighted; the mix of familiar souls-like mechanics, unique story, and innovative approach to difficulty has the potential to further invigorate a genre that is already teeming with new ideas. The Blight concept could be a game-changer if it pans out, and if it doesn't, there's still plenty to like in Blighted that Drinkbox seems likely to have another success story to add to the list with Guacamelee, Severed, and Nobody Saves The World.</p><p dir="ltr">Blighted is set to launch in 2026 on consoles and PC.</p>

                <p>Historically, collecting coins in the Mario Kart series generally grants a bit of a speed boost. While never a huge improvement, it gives players another way to build a marginal edge in races. In <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-world/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart World</a>, coins do grant additional speed, but it's a more complicated process than in past titles.</p><p>New evidence surfaced by TikTok user <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shortcatt321</a> suggests that each additional coin (up to the max of 20) does not grant a constant speed boost. In other words, coins add speed on a curve--rather than the speed bonus building on a linear scale. In <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shortcatt321/video/7515145980736490783?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-8xGBJ9WlJbZ" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a TikTok video</a>, the user explains that this speed boost curve is actually different depending on the kart and character a player selects.</p>

<p>The curve for low top-speed builds is front-loaded, where early coins add a bigger bonus than later coins. High top-speed builds, meanwhile, are the inverse: later coins matter much more. At 20 coins acquired, both types of builds receive the same boost of 5.1% faster top speed.</p><p>Because of this discrepancy, optimal strategies toward collecting coins can differ depending on whether you choose a lightweight or heavyweight combo. Shortcatt321 suggests that collecting at least seven coins is important for lightweight, low-speed character/kart players, while heavyweight combos should either commit to collecting 20 coins, or not worry about coins at all.</p><p>Mario Kart World launched with the Switch 2 earlier this month, and it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/79-of-switch-2-buyers-in-the-us-also-bought-mario-kart-world/1100-6532449/" data-ref-id="1100-6532449">an immediate hit with Switch 2 early adopters</a>.

If Pillars of Eternity 3 ever happens, director Josh Sawyer says it will likely take some influence from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p>Sawyer--who directed both of the Pillars of Eternity games--recently suggested that that the franchise's isometric perspective needs to shift to the 3D style in Baldur's Gate 3 in order to enhance the overall presentation of the game.</p><p>"I think if we did go into a 3D environment, we could patch up one of the things that's really lacking," Sawyer told <a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/editorials/i-dont-feel-good-about-the-industry-but-i-feel-good-about-the-abi/z377e" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamepressure</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/josh-sawyer-says-a-hypothetical-pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-3d-just-like-baldurs-gate-3-with-environmental-mechanics-elevation-hazards-and-dynamic-terrain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>). "Because [Pillars of Eternity 2] is isometric, there's no sense of height, and the environment can't be that dynamic. When you compare it to something like [Baldur's Gate 3], you realize it's such a huge part of the appeal. I think, at some point, I would like to see a game that used all those Deadfire mechanics, plus more environmental mechanics, elevation hazards, and dynamic terrain stuff. That could be super cool... I think that a third game should be an isometric 3D with an environment more like Baldur’s Gate 3. It would work."</p><p>In 2020, Sawyer suggested that Pillars of Eternity 3 would only happen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-says-a-3rd-game-will-/1100-6480569/" data-ref-id="1100-6480569">if the dev team were excited to make it</a>.

That title was launched earlier this year.</p><p>Sawyer hinted at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-director-is-working-on-a-new-p/1100-6480578/" data-ref-id="1100-6480578">his follow-up to Pillars of Eternity 2</a> in 2020, which turned out to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pentiment-review-layers-of-history/1900-6417998/" data-ref-id="1900-6417998">Pentiment</a>.

It's a bit chunkier and wider than the real thing, so it doesn't have the same exact form factor, but it adds several compelling features that make it a versatile option for GameCube games on Switch Online as well as modern Nintendo games.</p><p>Beyond offering conventional bumpers and triggers, the Warrior Lite has two remappable back buttons. The right and left back buttons have a one-piece panel design that can be removed and switched with an alternate panel inside the box. The main difference between the two styles of back buttons is that one of them is textured and slightly raised for increased tactile feedback.</p><p>The Warrior Lite is equipped with anti-drift Hall Effect sticks. The right stick mimics the GameCube's yellow C-stick, but you can swap it out for a yellow stick with a more conventional, larger grip. Similarly, you can switch between octagonal stick gates inspired by the GameCube controller and regular stick gates with a circular range of motion.</p><p>Face buttons, the 8-way D-pad, and shoulder bumpers are actuated by microswitches, giving them a mouse-click feel. Like the sticks, the triggers are activated with Hall Effect sensors, and can be set at two different stopping points with the locking switches on the back. Other core features include built-in, adjustable rumble and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p>The main downside here is battery life, as the Lite version has a smaller battery that only runs for up to five hours on a full charge. Like many Bluetooth controllers for Switch 2 and Switch, you can use the Warrior Lite on PC, mobile, Steam Deck, and other devices.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">NYXI Warrior Wireless Controller for Switch 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical\/dp\/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$69 | Adds support for original GameCube hardware</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p><ul><li>Bluetooth Wireless: Switch 2, Switch, PC, Mobile</li><li><strong>2.4GHz Wireless: GameCube, Wii, PC</strong></li><li>Connects wirelessly via Bluetooth</li><li>Hall Effect sticks and triggers</li><li>Modern trigger and bumper design</li><li>Adjustable trigger locks</li><li>Two remappable back buttons</li><li>Swappable back button module</li><li>Swappable sticks and gates</li><li>Microswitch face buttons</li><li>8-way microswitch D-pad</li><li>6-axis gyroscope for motion controls</li><li>Adjustable dual-rumble motors</li><li><strong>Up to 10 hours of battery life</strong></li></ul><p>NYXI released the original Warrior controller last year.

The Warrior also has a larger battery that can run for up to 10 hours between charges, which is a nice perk.</p><p>The Warrior comes in three different colors--purple, orange, and black--though only purple is still in stock at Amazon.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514616"></a><figcaption>NYXI Warrior back button module and trigger locks</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514616-nyxiwarriorback.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png" data-ref-id="1300-4514617,1300-4514618" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514617-nyxiwarriorfront.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4514618-nyxiwarriorside.png"></figure><h2>GameCube-style Controllers for Switch 2 &amp; Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PowerA GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Toad)</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori GameCube Style Wireless Controller (Zelda)</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Official Nintendo GameCube Controller (Switch 2)</a> -- $65</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-PC-Mechanical-Vibration/dp/B0F631L416?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior Lite</a> -- $45 (<del>$50</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-Nintendo-Switch-Joysticks-Mechanical/dp/B0D83WDY28?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Warrior</a> -- $69</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=This+GameCube+Controller+With+Back+Buttons+And+Hall+Effect+Sticks+Works+On+Switch+2&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-16+12%3A18%3A29&amp;fnarticle_id=6532458&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fnyxigame.com%2Fproducts%2Fnyxi-wizard-2-wireless-joy-pad-for-switch-switch-oled&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthis-gamecube-controller-with-back-buttons-and-hall-effect-sticks-works-on-switch-2%2F1100-6532458%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NYXI Wizard 2</a> -- $80 (<del>$90</del>)</li></ul><p>From a customization perspective, the Warrior lineup is the most impressive GameCube-style controller we've tried, but there are other GameCube controllers for Switch 2 that offer a more authentic experience. As mentioned, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-gamecube-controller-120833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's new wireless GameCube controller for Switch 2</a> is as close to the original as you'll find. It feels almost exactly like the original, just without the cable and with a few extra small buttons on the top: C button for GameChat, home/menu buttons, and a small ZL button to make up for the fact the GameCube controller only had one shoulder button. But while this is best option for GameCube games on Switch Online, the aforementioned tiny ZL button makes it less than ideal for modern games.</p><p>Officially licensed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GameCube-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0CT5JPCCC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameCube-style controllers from PowerA</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Wireless-Battle-Gamecube-Controller/dp/B08896ZBZK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hori</a> add Nintendo-inspired designs and have modernized shoulder and trigger layouts. The form factor of these controllers is closer to the original GameCube controller, as they have slimmer profiles compared to the NYXI Warrior.</p><p>NYXI is also soon releasing an updated version of its Wizard controller with TMR electromagnetic sticks. The Wizard replaces the Joy-Con controllers on the original Switch and Switch OLED in handheld mode, but the left and right sides can connect together as a wireless controller in docked mode. It's important to note, however, that the Wizard 2 will only work in handheld mode on original Switch consoles.
