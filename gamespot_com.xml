Like last year's event, Lunar Awakening replaces all of the game's shrines with special Lunar Shrines. These shrines function much the same as their normal counterparts, only with even more powerful effects in addition to their usual ones. Lunar Artillery Shrines, for example, have a chance to blast enemies with a holy bomb in addition to piercing enemies with holy arrows as usual. Whereas Greed shrines typically just grant players more gold for killing monsters, the Lunar Greed Shrine actually makes it so every kill also has a chance to summon a Treasure Goblin.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435327"></a><figcaption>Players can earn free cosmetics by slaying monsters while under the effects of a Lunar Shrine during the event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4435327-dia_div_lunar_awakening_revised_enus_1920x1080_rd1_8_ts02b.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Lunar Shrine bonus effects are the same as they were during 2024's event, but what is different this time is the amount of bonus XP players gain while under the effects of a shrine. For this year's version, players will enjoy a 100%, multiplicative experience bonus for the duration of the shrine's effects, up from 50% last year. That will make leveling a new character or earning endgame Paragon points even faster (and it's already pretty darn fast to begin with).</p><p dir="ltr">Slaying monsters while under the effect of a Lunar Shrine will earn players the reputation needed to progress through the event's reward track. There are 10 rewards in total to claim, including a mount, weapon appearances, and a Resplendent Spark needed to craft Mythic Uniques. Lunar Awakening-themed items will also be available on Diablo 4's premium cosmetics shop for the duration of the event.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 recently saw the launch of Season 7--ne where players can equip new supernatural powers to aid them in slaying their foes. Many of the powers found in Season of Witchcraft, like Firebats and Piranhado, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-of-witchcraft-will-give-players-diablo-3-inspired-powers/1100-6528778/" data-ref-id="1100-6528778">take inspiration from Diablo 3's Witch Doctor</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The game's most recent update saw the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4s-armory-will-be-a-boon-for-eternal-players-and-the-chances-of-a-witch-class/1100-6528885/" data-ref-id="1100-6528885">addition of the Armory to both the Eternal and Seasonal realms</a>, allowing players to save up to five loadouts per character in the name of encouraging more build experimentation. It also brought major <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-7-patch-notes-reduce-rune-costs-and-brings-major-spiritborn-balance-changes/1100-6528887/" data-ref-id="1100-6528887">balance changes to Diablo 4's Runewords</a> and substantially nerfed its new expansion-exclusive class, the Spiritborn.</p>

Fans were required to register for tickets and participants were randomly selected. Now that the tickets went out earlier this week, some winners have been putting them up for sale on eBay.</p><p>The issue is that these tickets are non-transferable, meaning that whoever buys it from the reseller won't be able to get into the event.

There's another listing for a Dallas ticket, which is starting at a bid of $40, but has since also been taken down. Some are going for as high as $300, such as a listing for the event in New York.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435493" data-ratio="0.4326750448833" data-width="1114" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435493"></a><figcaption>The tickets are non-transferable, so buyer beware.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435493-screenshot2025-01-29at10.49.06%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435526" data-ratio="0.2938689217759" data-width="1892" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png" data-ref-id="1300-4435526"></a><figcaption>Think twice before buying a non-transferable ticket on eBay.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1646/16465123/4435526-untitled.png"></figure><p>The event will take place at various locations around the world in North America, Europe, Oceania, and Asia.

                <p>PlayStation has revealed this month's batch of free games for PlayStation Plus subscribers. All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting February 4--<strong>Payday 3</strong>, <strong>High on Life</strong>, and <strong>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</strong>. If you haven't claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-january-2025/1100-6528590/" data-ref-id="1100-6528590">January's PlayStation Plus free games yet</a>, make sure to do so before next Tuesday.</p><p>Sony also mentioned that it will focus more on offering PS5 titles through the monthly games and Game Catalog benefit starting January 2026. While PS4 owners may still receive free games as part of the subscription,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-moving-away-from-monthly-ps4-games/1100-6529101/" data-ref-id="1100-6529101"> Sony says these will only be occasionally handed out from next year</a>.</p><h2>Payday 3</h2><p>It hasn't exactly been smooth sailing for Payday 3, which was supposed to kick off the next era of the popular bank-heist-simulator series. While the core game isn't bad, numerous server issues and low player numbers made for a rough launch, but developer Starbreeze hasn't thrown in the towel on Payday 3. yet. As part of an effort titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-and-lots-more-in-a-series-of-patches/1100-6521545/" data-ref-id="1100-6521545">Operation Medic Bag</a>, Starbreeze has been steadily improving on the game with several patches and an offline mode.</p><h2>High on Life</h2><p>If you're a fan of Rick and Morty, then High on Life will appeal to you as it shares much of the same oddball humor as the hit animated series. A first-person shooter that features <em>very</em> talkative guns and an alien space cartel who get "high" on humans, the game was made by Squanch Games, a studio founded by Rick and Morty co-creator Justin Roiland and Tanya Watson. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/justin-roiland-resigns-from-squanch-games-amid-domestic-violence-allegations/1100-6510838/" data-ref-id="1100-6510838">Roiland resigned from the company in 2023</a>, following a series of controversies.</p><h2>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</h2><p>A remake of the original Pac-Man World platformer, Pac-Man World: Re-Pac is a charming game featuring the Bandai Namco icon. Its gameplay was overhauled and its graphics were updated for this 2022 release, which saw Pac-Man embark on a quest to save his friends and family from the ghosts who had kidnapped them.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus Free Games for February 2025</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4435512"></a><figcaption>PS Plus February 2025 free games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4435512-ps-plus-feb-2025.jpg"></figure><p><em>Available February 4 until March 3.</em></p><ul><li>Payday 3</li><li>High on Life</li><li>Pac-Man World: Re-Pac</li></ul>

                <p>Sony has announced a key change for the future of PlayStation Plus. Sony will shift away from offering PS4 games as it looks to focus on PS5 games instead.

This isn't starting soon, though, and will begin in January 2026.</p><p>"As we shift to PS5, PS4 games will no longer be a key benefit and will only be occasionally offered for PlayStation Plus Monthly Games and Game Catalog starting January 2026.

                <p>We've all participated in some form of online trash talk at some point in our lives. UFC fighter Brian Ortega, whose professional record is currently 16-4, was on the receiving end of some serious berating during a Fortnite game and decided to do something about it.</p><p>Ortega posted a video on his social media where he had a light-hearted confrontation with a young fan named Emi. Ortega flew from Los Angeles to North Carolina to exact his revenge in a way that might have Emi thinking differently about who he talks trash to online, as the former champion planted him in a rear naked choke and put him to sleep momentarily.</p><p>"A lot of people ask me, 'Hey, play with me on Fortnite!' Cool, cool. Only problem is, you guys be talking mad you-know-what," Ortega said. "So I had a homie, an online homie, start talking mad smack. The real reason why I flew to North Carolina is because he was talking shit, we made a bet. I said, 'Bro, I’ll fly over there and choke you out.' Here he is. I showed up."</p><p>The camera panned to Emi sitting down. Ortez continued by asking Emi "You going to go to sleep?"</p><p>Emi responded with "yes" while lightly laughing.</p><p>Ortega then applied a fully locked-in rear-naked choke to the fan and squeezed until he passed out. After a few seconds, the young man then woke up and flashed a peace sign to ensure Ortega's audience he was all right in the end.</p><p>"Shit, man! I took a nap! That felt weird," Emi added. "That shit was kinda fun!"</p><p>"When talking crap on Fortnite turns into a real-life lesson," Ortega wrote in the post. "For all my gamers out there, remember you never know who you might be playing with--respect to Emi for taking it like a man. No one was harmed in the making of this video. Professionals only."</p><p><em>Image source: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IVFp2l2jl8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UFC</a></em></p>
