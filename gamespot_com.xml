                <p>Bandai Namco confirmed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</a> is officially headed to the Switch 2 and Switch during Nintendo's July Partner Direct. These new Switch and Switch 2 versions will play just like the PS5, Xbox, and PC versions that launched last year, but will add support for motion controls for certain moves, such as Goku's Spirit Bomb ultimate attack. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will be available on Switch 2 and Switch in multiple versions, including a $60 physical standard edition and multiple digital editions that include tons of extra content, all of which are available to preorder now ahead of Sparking Zero's November 14 release date. Preordering any edition of the game on either of Nintendo's hybrid handhelds also unlocks several of the game's characters early.</p><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542785"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorder Bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542785-dbsparkingswitchpreorders.jpg"></figure><p>If you preorder Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero on either Switch 2 or Switch, you'll get Goku's child form from the most recent Dragon Ball anime, Dragon Ball Daima, as a bonus playable character. You'll also get early unlocks for six variations of Gogeta (the fused form of Goku and Vegeta) and Broly--but that's still a nice head start on unlocking the game's full 182-character roster. Here's a list of all the preorder bonus characters for the Switch 2 and Switch versions:</p><ul><li>Goku (Mini)</li><li>Gogeta (Base form)</li><li>Gogeta (Super Saiyan)</li><li>Gogeta (Super Saiyan Blue)</li><li>Broly (Base form)</li><li>Broly (Super Saiyan)</li><li>Broly (Legendary Super Saiyan)</li></ul><div title="6533637 -- Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Switch Preorder" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4018" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6533637 -- Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Switch Preorder" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero standard edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FK8ZVVD8,B0FK8VFYXX&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$60 | Releases November 14</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Switch 2 and Switch editions of Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero include the base game, plus the bonus and early character unlocks if you preorder ahead of launch. Physical preorders are available for $60 at multiple online retailers. Digital preorders are also available on the Switch eShop.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Switch 2 edition is a Game-Key Card release, meaning the cartridge does not include any of the game data, and instead works as physical DRM that allows you to download and play the digital version on your console. The original Switch version includes the full game data on the cart. It does not look like Bandai Namco is offering the option to upgrade from the Switch to Switch 2 edition. It's also uncertain how the game will perform on the original Switch, but Bandai Namco confirms that the more-powerful hardware of the Switch 2 will naturally offer better graphical power. </p></div>                      </div><h2>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition (Switch 2 and Switch)</h2><h4>$90 | Releases November 14</h4><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542903"></a><figcaption>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Digital Deluxe Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4542903-deluxedbzero.jpg"></figure><p>Along with the physical standard edition, Sparking Zero will also get two digital-only Switch 2 and Switch versions that include additional content.

The game is a celebration of the entire Dragon Ball franchise, featuring a roster of 182 characters from various Dragon Ball anime series and movies. In addition to the single-player campaign that spans multiple Dragon Ball sagas, there's also a mode that lets you change the outcome of notable moments from the series. The game also includes online and local multiplayer for up to six players.</p><p>There are several other great Dragon Ball games available for Switch, all of which are also backwards compatible with the Switch 2. If you're looking for another fighting game, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dragon Ball FighterZ is a superb entry in the genre</a>. Developed by Arc System Works, the studio behind Guilty Gear, Dragon Ball FighterZ is a 2.5D tag-team fighting game with a roster of characters pulled from Dragon Ball Z, GT, and Super. However, it offers a more traditional fighting game compared to the three-dimensional action of Sparking Zero. You can pick it up for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$25 at Amazon</a>.</p><p>For a story-focused single-player Dragon Ball experience, there's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a>. The game retells the entire Dragon Ball Z story of Goku, but it adds an action-RPG flair with an enjoyable grind and skill customization as you explore the anime's iconic world. The game has also received several post-launch expansions that adapt other Dragon Ball storylines, including Dragon Ball Super and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Daima</a>. Finally, there's also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a>, which allows you to create your own custom character and team up with Goku and the other Z Warriors to protect all of time and space. While it is an older game in the series, Xenoverse 2 has been supported constantly with new DLC over the years, and its roster is up to date with modern Dragon Ball media.</p><h2>More Dragon Ball Games on Switch</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Fighterz-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B07F2ZX3DN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> -- $25</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Awakes-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B097FQM3QN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot</a> -- $32.45</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Kakarot-Daima-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DZQMPT6P?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Kakarot: Daima Edition</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-Xenoverse-2-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N1034HX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</a> -- $25 (<strike>$30</strike>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-lorcana-tcg-reign-of-jafar-palace-heist-cooperative-game-is-steeply-discounted/1100-6531334/">Disney Lorcana TCG Palace Heist Solo And Co-Op Game Is Steeply Discounted</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-evo-2025-accessory-sale-ps5-dualsense-edge-controller-deals/1100-6531846/">PlayStation Evo 2025 Sale Features Rare Deals On DualSense Edge &amp; Pulse Headset</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-book-series-andrzej-sapkowski-box-set-deals-novel-reading-order/1100-6532972/">The Witcher 5-Novel Box Set On Sale For Just $33 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rds-game-traveler-deluxe-nintendo-switch-2-carrying-cases/1100-6532022/">Amazon Restocks The $40 Licensed Alternative To Switch 2 All-In-One Case</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/">Nintendo Switch 2 At Amazon - Console Restocks, Every Accessory You Can Buy, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-20th-anniversary-retrospective-box-set-gets-nice-discount/1100-6530148/">God Of War 20th Anniversary Retrospective Box Set Gets Nice Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-illustrated-book-is-only-30-at-amazon-right-now/1100-6533080/">Lord Of The Rings Tolkien Illustrated Book Is Only $30 At Amazon Right Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-anime-blu-ray-best-amazon-deals/1100-6524954/">Berserk's Best Anime Adaptation Gets Limited-Time Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p>Two years ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> was released out of early and quickly became one of the most popular RPG games of this generation. Now, Larian Studios is sharing some of the rare choices and other stats that it has compiled from players' choices during the last two years.</p><p>Only 2.07% of all players managed to beat 20 opponents while drunk, and 1.82% of players earned 100 gold from performing music. Larian posted several <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538860954058754131" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">infographics on the Steam page</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, including the fact that 3.87% of players beat Gortash in Wyrm's Rock without activating any traps. And half a million players have completed the game in Honor mode, compared to 1.1 million players who beat the game in Tactician mode. Out of the Honor mode players, only 4,647 players beat it with a level 1 character.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896" data-ratio="1" data-width="1080" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542896"></a><figcaption>If it's a popularity contest, Shadowheart has already won.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4542896-baldursgate3infographic.jpg"></figure><p>When it came time to pick the most-respecced companions, the outcome wasn't a surprise. Shadowheart led the way with 4,890,005 players, who were apparently evenly split between using her as a Life Cleric or a Death Cleric. Wyll was the second-most respecced companion with 1,417,506 players, while Gale finished in third with 684,454 players.</p><p>For some truly obscure choices, only 350 players respecced Minsc into a Death Domain Cleric, and there were 598 players who adopted a child with Wyll. According to Larian, the studio is also going to expand the official toolkit for mods. Over 8,500 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3 mods</a> have been created since September 2024 with over 265 million mod downloads.</p><p>Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke recently thanked Baldur's Gate 3 players for their support and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-studios-ceo-reflects-on-two-years-of-baldurs-gate-3-and-teases-the-studios-next-crazy-thing/1100-6533660/" data-ref-id="1100-6533660">briefly teased the studio's next game</a>. Vincke had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-boss-talks-ai-single-player-games-managing-risk-and-more/1100-6531142/" data-ref-id="1100-6531142">a long interview with GameSpot</a> earlier this year, which touched upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-director-says-making-dlc-for-its-games-is-boring-for-larian/1100-6531125/" data-ref-id="1100-6531125">why the studio didn't make DLC</a> for Baldur's Gate 3 and the company's stance on AI in game development.

                <p dir="ltr">Advancing through the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681580">Grounded 2</a> campaign will eventually task you with hacking two O.R.C. transmitters. These transmitters can be tricky to reach, especially if you don't have the right gear to tackle their locations. In this guide, we'll show you how to reach the O.R.C. transmitters you need to hack in the Signals and Stashes mission.</p><p dir="ltr">The transmitters are located at the Trash Can and Picnic Table points of interest, and you'll find the guide for both below. Each location has O.R.C. enemies (the bugs with purple glowing receiver devices) you might need to fight off, so you'll want to be prepared with your weapon of choice and some bandages. You'll also get an additional side objective for each O.R.C. transmitter you hack, and we'll discuss those locations as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Picnic_Table_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Picnic Table O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542861"></a><figcaption>Picnic Table POI location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542861-picnictablemaplocation2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Picnic Table POI is located just north of the Snackbar, as shown in the image above. This is the area of the map with the red and white-checkered tablecloth.</p><p dir="ltr">Before venturing to the Picnic Table, you'll want to make sure you're geared up to combat the game's chill effect. You'll be navigating through a cooler, and you'll freeze without some sort of protection. It's best to have armor that helps protect against cold or at least a few pieces of spicy candy.</p><p dir="ltr">For the cold-resistant gear, you'll want at least the Mitey Muffs headpiece and the Fuzzy Mukluks. These are the earliest options available to you.</p><p dir="ltr">The Mitey Muffs require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">5- Mite Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">5 - Grub Hide</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Fuzzy Mukluks require:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 - Bee Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Bug Rubber</li><li dir="ltr">3 - Lingonberry Leather</li><li dir="ltr">2- Silk Rope</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542865"></a><figcaption>Follow up this side of the tablecloth</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542865-picnictablepath.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you're geared up for the cold, head to the Picnic Table location on the map. You'll want to walk or ride your buggy up the red and white-checkered tablecloth. You'll have a few enemies to fight along the way, including mites and spiders.</p><p dir="ltr">The very top of the tablecloth is blocked off, so eventually you'll need to go another way to reach the top of the table. You'll notice there's a gap you need to cross to continue along the path.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542864"></a><figcaption>Tablecloth tunnel</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542864-picnictabletableclothtunnel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The safest way to cross over is to slip under the tunnel created by the cloth, and you'll fight a few spiders here as well. This will lead you to a wooden beam you can cross to reach the other side of the table. Several roach nymphs are scurrying around this new area, but you can ignore them. They won't fight unless you instigate it.</p><p dir="ltr">Your objective marker will point you to the entrance for a cooler. This is an outdoor cooler for drinks, and it's ice cold inside. You'll want to make sure you have your outdoor gear equipped or spicy candy ready.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542868"></a><figcaption>Transmitter on top of Picnic Table</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542868-orcpicnictable.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Navigate through the passageway inside the cooler, and you'll finally reach the top of the picnic table. Here you'll see the O.R.C. transmitter and need to interact with it to hack it. Of course, you'll need to fight off O.R.C. ladybugs and possibly spiders in order to reach it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pines">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pines</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542873"></a><figcaption>Red arrow marks the O.R.C. Pine Hill location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542873-orcpinehilllocationonmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Picnic Table transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the Pines." This isn't too hard to complete. An objective marker should lead you into the Pines section of the map, where you'll find spiders and Lingonberries growing. However, this objective marker was not showing for me, so if this is also the case for you, the area is found near the Ranger Outpost: Pine Hill. Just head to the path on the left side of the outpost entrance.</p><p dir="ltr">This leads you to an area where you'll need to fight off Orb Weaver O.R.C. enemies and hack another transmitter. Spears and daggers can work well here. This isn't terribly difficult, but make sure you have bandages just in case.</p><p dir="ltr">It's also worth harvesting the Lingonberries while you're there. These are an important resource, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-find-and-use-lingonberries-and-blueberries-for-leather-in-grounded-2/1100-6533438/" data-ref-id="1100-6533438">Lingonberry leather</a> is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_reach_the_Garbage_Can_O_R_C__transmitter">How to reach the Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542875"></a><figcaption>Garbage Can O.R.C. transmitter location on map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542875-garbagecanpoilocation.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To reach the Garbage Can, you'll first need to get some gear to help you survive the area's toxic gas. I recommended a gas mask for the garbage can area. You can use the Gastro Goo smoothies, but these have such a limited time of effect. Either way, you'll need to kill a stinkbug to craft what you need. I'd also recommended collecting a few dandelion tufts. It's really easy to fall when navigating the top of the garbage can.</p><p dir="ltr">The gas mask requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Weevil Nose</li><li dir="ltr">4 - Gnat Fuzz</li><li dir="ltr">2 - Crude Rope</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Part</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Gasto Goo smoothie requires:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 - Stinkbug Gas Sack</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Roach Chunk</li><li dir="ltr">1 - Aphid Honeydew</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you're prepared to survive the gas, head on over to the Garbage Can POI marked on the image above. This location is best navigated with the Red Soldier Ant buggy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542877"></a><figcaption>Climb the Garbage Can POI here</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542877-garabagecanreachingthecan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll want to circle around the can until you find the ledge near it. From here, you can jump onto a small branch growing into the side of the garbage can. Then, jump onto a banana. While standing on the banana, turn around and jump on the white, plastic spork. You'll continue to follow this narrow path around the can, working your way up by navigating limbs and ropes until you reach the top.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542878"></a><figcaption>Navigating the branches around Garbage Can POI</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542878-garbagecannavigatingbranch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You'll see the O.R.C. transmitter at the very top of the trash pile. You can potentially sneak up here without enemies spotting you, or you might get caught battling an O.R.C cockroach. Either way, you need to survive and interact with the device to hack it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_defeat_the_O_R_C__soldiers_by_the_pond">How to defeat the O.R.C. soldiers by the pond</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881" data-ratio="0.56283783783784" data-width="1480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542881"></a><figcaption>Location for O.R.C soldiers by the pond</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4542881-blueberrymaplocationmarked.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Hacking the Garbage Can transmitter will update your objective to "find and defeat the O.R.C soldiers by the pond." This isn't too hard to complete. The object marker leads you to a section of the map filled with berry bushes.</p><p dir="ltr">The berries are guarded by O.R.C. bees, so you want to be prepared to fight and kill them. Using a bow and arrow can be useful here for fighting at range. You'll also want some bandages. All you technically need to do is take out the O.R.C. bees, but it's worth sticking around to also harvest the blueberries.</p><p dir="ltr">Blueberries are an important resource, as blueberry leather is needed in several crucial crafting recipes.</p>

                <p>It is no secret that 2021's Battlefield 2042 was not the success that EA and developer DICE hoped for.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Another producer, David Sirland, said the studio spent a lot of time thinking about the core pillars of Battlefield--destruction, classes, and vehicles--and designing Battlefield 6 in service to those.</p><p>Christofi said it was important to define what Battlefield's core tenets were and Sirland said it was also important to nail down what they are not.</p><p>"We needed to define that clearly, because that guides us for a long time, like 10-plus years, or whatever. It should be that stringent. Sure, you can amend it and change it, but everyone on the team should be able to feel that and be like, 'Okay, I know what we're doing,'" he said. "So, when I get a new idea, does it fit? Yes, cool. It's not like it tells exactly what to do, but it should tell you the lane to stay within. I think that is what's needed. Because I think that maybe, if anything, for 2042, that wasn't super clear, right, especially not over time. It was more of a reaction to something that didn’t work and we changed it as fast as possible."</p><p>In 2022, DICE general manager Rebecka Coutaz reacted to Battlefield 2042's poor launch, saying, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">"Everybody was disappointed."</a> Following the game's release. DICE shuffled its top leaders, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-franchise-undergoes-major-shake-up/1100-6498521/" data-ref-id="1100-6498521">former GM Oskar Gabrielson leaving the studio and other major changes in a big shakeup.</a></p><p>EA also created a new label, Battlefield Studios, to oversee the development of the brand. DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive all work under Battlefield Studios. The former general manager of Call of Duty--Byron Beede--is now the general manager of Battlefield. The future of Battlefield is also being developed under the leadership of EA executive Vince Zampella, a former Call of Duty boss as well.</p><p>So far, EA appears to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-could-be-the-successor-to-battlefield-3-4-the-series-needs/1100-6533646/" data-ref-id="1100-6533646">saying and doing the right things with Battlefield 6</a> to help win fans back, but only time will tell if the game can stick the landing and find a place in an ultra-competitive marketplace. Beyond Battlefield 6's multiplayer and campaign, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">new battle royale experience is in the works as well.</a></p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> begins August 7 for a limited group of people before expanding more widely later in August. The full game, meanwhile, launches October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>In the wake of the official <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">Oblivion Remastered's release</a>, the developers behind Skylivion are making clear that their ambitious mod over 10 years in the making is far more than just a graphics update: It "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion looks to recreate the 2006 open-world RPG in the engine of 2011's Skyrim, albeit with new content and gameplay changes. The mod is still slated to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-to-release-by-2025/1100-6510685/" data-ref-id="1100-6510685">release in 2025</a>, and in the latest development diary for the project, the TESRenewal mod team behind Skyblivion answers the question that has been top of mind since Oblivion Remastered released in April--what's the point of Skyblivion when the official remaster is already available?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3MH-BqXk2WA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The answer is simple," the dev diary states. "Skyblivion is a full-scale remake that reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards. While the official remaster impressively upgrades textures and assets, Skyblivion introduces entirely newly designed areas, dungeons, cities, gameplay enhancements, and much more."</p><p dir="ltr">Far from just Oblivion running in a new engine, the devs state that "every fort, home, cave, and landscape has been thoughtfully redesigned."</p><p dir="ltr">"We've infused this sort of creative detail to breathe new life into a beloved classic--one that is nearly two decades old," the dev diary states.</p><p dir="ltr">The rest of the dev diary provides ample evidence to back up the team's "full-scale remake" claims, as it highlights how it remade the city of Anvil to feature a large harbor and is introducing a new Oblivion biome to make closing Oblivion gates "less repetitive and monotonous."</p><p dir="ltr">An overhaul to the original game's "unique" items also coming with Skyblivion. The devs note how in the original game, most unique items were unique in "name only" and were largely just modified versions of existing items recolored with a slight stat boost. In Skylivion, unique items will be "truly unique," with updated appearances and, in the case of many unique weapons, new attack animations to help players "diversify" their playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">Previous <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ambitious-elder-scrolls-skyblivion-mod-shows-off-20-minutes-of-quest-gameplay/1100-6525882/" data-ref-id="1100-6525882">Skyblivion updates</a> outlined how it will include new quests, monsters, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and even new music, as well as updates to the game's menus and UI.</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion doesn't have specific release date, but the dev diary states the team is "confident" it will meet its goal of releasing this year. The mod will be free to download for those who own both Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're excited to show off more soon and get Skyblivion into your hands, but we've still got work to do in finalizing key areas and giving Skyblivion proper quality and assurance to make sure we all get the game fans deserve," the video concludes.</p><p dir="ltr">In light of Oblivion Remastered's reveal, Skyblivion's project lead said the release of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">remaster was a "win-win" for the community</a>. Bethesda later gifted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-gave-oblivion-remastered-keys-to-the-entire-skyblivion-remake-team/1100-6531035/" data-ref-id="1100-6531035">copies of Oblivion Remastered to the entire Skyblivion</a> mod team.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Portal was introduced in Battlefield 2042 as a means to allow players to create and customize their own gametypes with custom rules and settings. In Battlefield 6, it goes further and allows players to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-portal-map-creator-makes-it-easier-than-ever-to-design-and-play/1100-6533609/" data-ref-id="1100-6533609">make their own maps.</a></p><p>The nice thing about a server browser, fans say, is that it allows players the freedom to choose to play whatever they want, on any map they want, in a region near them with an ideal ping. While there may not be a server browser for official servers in Battlefield 6, it's likely fans will do the work themselves and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1metpxq/no_server_browser_for_official_servers_so_its/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">create copies of the official servers</a>. That may not be an ideal experience, however.</p><p>Battlefield 6 producer Alexia Christofi addressed the fan discussion about server browsers, asking people to send in feedback as to why an official server browser is so important to them. Responses <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1951863732260286563" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">flooded in</a>, and Christofi highlighted the key takeaways.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898821539017159" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Feels like your most important things are:<br>- persistent servers<br>- a sense of community and a way to play together<br>- being able to choose specific maps/modes<br>- being able to filter by ping/server fullness <br>- support for low pop regions<br>More to share on this in future. But.. (1/3) <a href="https://t.co/PWqUIz7GHe" rel="nofollow ">https://t.co/PWqUIz7GHe</a></p>  — Alexia Christofi (@Lex_mate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898821539017159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Christofi went on to say that Battlefield 6's server browser, via Portal, does in fact "answer all these wants." Christofi acknowledged, "Yes, it's via Portal and shows only community experiences," but pointed out that players can earn full XP gains with these modes and they will be promoted "front and center" in Battlefield 6's main menu.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Lex_mate/status/1951898828669395394" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Again, more to share on this in the future - but seeing all your replies I think what we have caters to the majority of use cases. We can talk more about if/why it feels like it's not enough at a later date!
