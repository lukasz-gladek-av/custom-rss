                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4's</a> seventh seasonal update, Season of Witchcraft, arrives on January 21 and will give players a whole new set of fan-favorite powers from an old Diablo class to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the new 25 Witchcraft Powers are taken almost directly from abilities used by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3's</a> Witch Doctor. The class hasn't made its way to Diablo 4 officially just yet, but Blizzard isn't being shy about paying homage to the frog-slinging mystic. Powers like Firebat Servants, various Hexes, Poison Frog Servants, Soul Harvest, and Piranhado are all taken from the Witch Doctor's Diablo 3 playbook and will be usable by any class.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4426521"></a><figcaption>Everything new that's coming as part of Diablo 4 Season 7.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4426521-div_s7_summary_infographic_enus_1920x1080_ll05%282%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To earn those Witchcraft Powers and others, players will need to aid a coven underneath the Tree of Whispers by completing new Whisper bounties and hunting down Headrotten enemies that have been stolen from the Tree of Whispers. Like some previous seasons, specific zones on the map will periodically transform into Headhunt zones where numerous Headrotten enemies can be found. After completing bounties in the zone, there is a rare chance for an Uprooted Cocoon to spawn a deadly boss that, once slain, can be returned to the coven underneath the Tree of Whispers for a greater reward. Players can also discover Rootholds within Headrotten zones. These seasonal dungeons need a key to unlock, but will further aid players in increasing their standing with the coven. The Tree of Whispers will additionally have a chance of rewarding players with an Ancestral Collection, which guarantees at least one Ancestral item.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new powers, players will be able to equip new Occult Gems that will further enhance their Witchcraft Powers. Many gems have effects that enhance specific categories of Witchcraft powers or are activated once a player equips a certain number of powers from a particular category. In addition to their unique effects, each Occult Gem grants 160 Armor and 8% Resist All, which should make them an attractive choice for those looking to take full advantage of their Witchcraft Powers.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big addition in Diablo 4 Season 7 is the Armory, a feature that will actually be a permanent feature going forward. Players will be able to create up to five loadouts per character that can be easily swapped between with the click of a button. Doing so will automatically equip the skills, Paragon Board, Glyphs, and gear saved to the loadout, allowing players to easily change builds without having to constantly reset their skill tree or Paragon Board. It will not cost gold to swap loadouts using the Armory--once a skill tree and Paragon Board have been saved to the Armory, that build can be swapped free of charge.</p><p dir="ltr">Other permanent changes coming in Season of Witchcraft include an improved layout to the area around the Tree of Whispers, as well as making it so each specific class quest only needs to be completed once per class. Players who afterward make a new character of the same class will be able to access their unique class power earlier without having to do the requisite quest. The game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-is-giving-out-free-diablo-4-boosts-and-automatically-unlocking-those-annoying-lilith-altars/1100-6527717/" data-ref-id="1100-6527717">welcome back level boost</a> will be sticking around permanently, and Unique items with Greater Affixes will also be improved, with Unique powers having their minimum rolls increased when the item sports a Greater Affix. There is additionally a new Unique item for each class, and for Vessel of Hatred owners, three new runes to experiment with.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard will share more details about Diablo 4 Season 7 during a developer livestream on January 16. Diablo 4 Season 6 revolved around the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-how-to-unlock-and-equip-runewords/1100-6527208/" data-ref-id="1100-6527208">Runewords</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/" data-ref-id="1100-6527178">Mercenaries</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-a-huge-first-of-its-kind-dungeon-filled-with-exclusive-rewards/1100-6526026/" data-ref-id="1100-6526026">co-op-only dungeon</a>.</p>

                <p>There have been countless post-apocalyptic video games before, and nature rarely behaves the same way that it does in our world. In Forest Reigns, nature appears to not only be alive in the new world, but also aware and thinking. In the game's announcement trailer below, a human makes the mistake of accidentally damaging a tree, which invites immediate retaliation from the plants.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pok1Rvuv1k4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pok1Rvuv1k4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Forest Reigns is a first-person shooter that is being developed by VG Entertainment Studio--the Ukrainian developer behind Survarium and Fear the Wolves. The new game takes place in Paris after the City of Light has been reclaimed by nature and transformed into a jungle. Even the wildlife seem to have evolved, as the errant gunshot in the video above ricocheted off the skull of a mutated warthog. If that's any indication of how the other animals have changed, then humanity may be in some serious trouble.</p><p>However, nature is the great equalizer in this game. It can turn against you if you harm it, but nature can also be harnessed against your enemies if you set them up for it. Regardless, it would be a mistake to let your guard down, as nature can just as easily turn against the player if they make the wrong move. The player's choices will also determine the events of the story.</p><p>"We've always had a passion for creating system-driven games, where the player's freedom of action could shape the story and provide unique playthrough experiences," said VG Entertainment's Ruslan Didenko via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forest-reigns-announced-for-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "After years of multiplayer online production, we are now ‘back to the roots' with creating Forest Reigns–a solid single-player FPS with a twisted story, exploration, survival, role-playing elements, and on top of all that, the interactive environment! This is the most daring concept we've ever explored. With Forest Reigns, we aim to bring something cool and fresh to the genre."</p><p>Forest Reigns is coming to PC and it's available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3325070/Forest_Reigns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.
