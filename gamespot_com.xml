                <p>Since his breakthrough role in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, fans can't get enough of Ben Starr. Neither can he, as in a video for GameSpot, the voice actor decided to play through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/date-everything/">Date Everything</a> by only dating his own character.</p><p dir="ltr">The surreal and comedic sandbox dating sim lets you literally date everything, thanks to a pair of magical glasses called Dateviators, which transform everyday household objects into dateable characters with their own stories. Each one is brought to by a huge roster of voice actors, including Ashly Burch, Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, Felicia Day, Steve Blum, Ashley Johnson, as well as the game's lead designer and veteran voice actor Ray Chase of Final Fantasy XV fame. Despite more than 100 dateable objects, "resident video game narcissist" Starr has opted to only date himself.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-NZAuS3INM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1-NZAuS3INM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Starr actually voices multiple characters as he plays a personified door called Dorian and there are 17 variations of Dorian throughout the house. There's Front Dorian who wears a little hat, Back Dorian, which the actor said he recorded "facing away from the microphone with my hand over my mouth", as well as Trap Dorian, who happens to wear a lot less clothes than the rest.</p><p dir="ltr">Date Everything is considerably more lighthearted than Starr's more dramatic roles, including this year's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. But he is no stranger to getting weird and silly, having donned costume and makeup as the Balatro jester Jimbo for a trailer announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatros-next-free-update-adds-eight-more-crossovers-today/1100-6528418/">Balatro's Friends of Jimbo 3 update</a>, and did the same when he collected the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-bafta-games-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6298/#12">Bafta games</a> award for best debut on behalf of developer Localthunk.</p><p dir="ltr">Since its release earlier this month, Date Everything has had "generally favourable" reviews on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/date-everything/">Metacritic</a>, and "overwhelmingly positive" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">Steam</a> user reviews.</p>

                <p>A game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bongo-cat/" data-ref-id="5000-656425">Bongo Cat</a> has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/you-probably-havent-heard-of-bongo-cat-but-over-100000-people-are-playing-it-right-now/1100-6530839/" data-ref-id="1100-6530839">consistently appearing at the top</a> of <a href="https://steamdb.info/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam's concurrent players chart</a> in the last few months, sitting alongside long-time heavy-hitters like Counter-Strike 2 and PUBG in the top five. Yet despite regularly attracting over 150,000 concurrents, the game doesn't actually make any money, its developer has revealed in a recent interview.</p><p>Marcel Zurawka is the CEO and co-founder of Irox Games, the studio behind Bongo Cat. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steams-fourth-most-played-game-doesnt-really-make-any-money-and-its-developer-says-its-better-off-that-way" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Zurawka pulled back the curtain on the game's viral success, revealing that the high player numbers haven't translated to income for the studio.</p><p>"Some people said, 'Oh you're now rich.' That's bullshit. I didn't make it for the money at all," Zurawka said. "So the first month of March, we made $2000 net, after Steam cuts and everything." He shares all of Bongo Cat's monthly income--$4050 for April, the peak of the game's virality, $3800 in May, and down to $2800 for June so far.</p><p>"It's not even paying a developer for us," he adds. "If you just look at the numbers, it's actually losing us money in the end."</p><p>Bongo Cat is a free <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-idle-games/2900-5676/" data-ref-id="2900-5676">idle game</a> that's really more of a desktop app than an actual game. It puts a little cat on top of your task bar, who taps his paws on a counter for every key press and mouse click. Bongo Cat can discover different hats as the counter goes up, and these items can be traded on Community Marketplaces for real money--which has also resulted in elevated bot activity in the game.</p><p>Zurawka says that the money made from marketplace transactions is generally less than half of Bongo Cat's total income, with the bulk of its sales coming from paid cat skins available in the game as microtransactions.</p><p>Making money was never the goal of Bongo Cat, however. "I want to have it as an easy companion tool for everybody and don't want anyone to pay anything," Zurawka explains. "For me, it should always be as accessible as possible. I don't want to pay-wall anything."</p><p>The game's success has had a different kind of positive impact on the studio, however, acting as a marketing tool that's driven views and wishlists for the studio's next title in development, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/oku/" data-ref-id="5000-681663">Oku</a>.</p>

In fact, Jimbo seems positively giddy about the prospect of some zombie-killing mayhem in the announcement video for the Friend of Aiden Bundle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpu29Y7m2FY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gpu29Y7m2FY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This is a free bundle, and Dying Light 2 developer Techland has indicated that it can be unlocked by finding "the mysterious posters in the Bazaar and the Fish Eye." From there, players will have to solve riddles that "will test your knowledge of Villedor." This adds two new quests to the game. Once those are completed, the following items can be yours:</p><ul><li>Jimbo’s Outfit--No clowning around with this outfit on, you've got a job to do: kill some zombies!</li><li>Ceremonial Dagger--It's no longer just a Joker. Grab the dagger and show 'em you're not bluffing! Increase your multiplier by defeating different types of enemies, performing finishers and destroying Joker Charms. <strong>Note:</strong> the multiplier is reset when the weapon is repaired, so get all you can out of it!</li><li>Joker Charm--Which Joker will you get? Who knows! Create a charm, and you'll receive a random one with a unique gameplay effect. Just like in Balatro, some will be more useful than others.</li><li>Flying Blind Paraglider--You might miss out on a few chips, but every poker player has to have an exit plan when the odds aren't looking good.</li></ul><p>This isn't the first collaboration for Balatro, which has had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-is-now-on-game-pass-with-new-fallout-and-assassins-creed-collaborations/1100-6529681/" data-ref-id="1100-6529681">previous crossovers</a> with Dead by Daylight, Civilization VII, Critical Role, Assassin's Creed, Fallout, Bugsnax, Slay the Princess, and Rust. Balatro developer LocalThunk admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-creator-only-just-recently-100-completed-his-own-game/1100-6532649/" data-ref-id="1100-6532649">he only recently 100% completed his own game</a>. Actor Jack Black has also come forward and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jack-black-really-needs-your-balatro-tips/1100-6530586/" data-ref-id="1100-6530586">asked players to send him their Balatro tips</a>. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/balatro-hits-big-sales-milestone-after-being-showered-with-awards/1100-6528912/" data-ref-id="1100-6528912">Balatro passed 5 million in sales</a> across all platforms.</p><p>As for Dying Light, Techland has the next game in the franchise, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, slated to hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on August 22.

Now, developer Sloclap is teaming up with Puma, one of the leading companies in footwear and sports apparel, to bring players some new gear options in this wildly popular soccer game.</p><p>The official teaser video for this collaboration only shows a few of Rematch's new items, including a Puma shirt, shoes, and shin guards.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DP4gVa8v1ok" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DP4gVa8v1ok" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Apparently this is the only Puma-exclusive outfit currently in Rematch, but the announcement indicates that more Puma clothing options will be added over time. Sloclap also notes that "the in-game Rematch outfit consists of popular in-real-life collections mixed and matched to create a stylish outfit that lets you look as good as you play."</p><p>Over 1 million players sampled Rematch on its first day alone, including gamers who subscribe to Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass Ultimate</a>. The game depicts a potential future for soccer that's set four decades down the line. Instead of fielding a full team, there are arcade-style 5v5 matchups, with options for 3v3 and 4v4 battles as well. There have also been several tweaks to the game, including the removal of fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, draws, and shoot-outs. Even the ball is always in play because the entire game takes place inside a cage.</p><p>Although Rematch is available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-wont-have-cross-play-options-ready-in-time-for-launch/1100-6532448/" data-ref-id="1100-6532448">there aren't currently any options for cross-play</a>. Sloclap still intends to add that feature at a later date. Rematch players have recently discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-players-discover-jumping-is-faster-than-running-but-dev-is-fixing-that-soon/1100-6532753/" data-ref-id="1100-6532753">jumping is faster than running</a> in this game, but Sloclap is already planning a fix for that.</p>

                <p>Nintendo is expanding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/" data-ref-id="5005-154">Switch 2</a>'s slim GameCube library with another classic next week. The beloved arcade soccer game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-strikers/" data-ref-id="5000-24383">Super Mario Strikers</a> will join the lineup on July 3.</p><p>Originally released in 2005, Super Mario Strikers is a fast-paced soccer game starring an assortment of iconic Mario characters. Like other Mario sports titles, the game features numerous arcade elements, including items like banana peels that can be used to trip up your opponent, as well as powerful special shots that are worth two goals if successfully executed.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VOcz6Z5PRY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1VOcz6Z5PRY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Super Mario Strikers would go on to spawn two sequels. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-charged/" data-ref-id="5000-28061">Mario Strikers Charged</a> launched for the Wii in 2007, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-strikers-battle-league/" data-ref-id="5000-557731">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a> was released on the Switch back in 2022.</p><p>With the addition of Super Mario Strikers, Switch Online's GameCube library spans four games so far. Nintendo has already confirmed that more classics like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-mario-sunshine/" data-ref-id="5000-3885">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance/" data-ref-id="5000-20450">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-colosseum/" data-ref-id="5000-18350">Pokemon Colosseum</a> are coming to the service in the future.</p><p>The GameCube library is one of a few Switch 2-exclusive perks of the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack plan. In addition, subscribers can download the Switch 2 upgrade packs for both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" data-ref-id="5000-107502">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" data-ref-id="5000-497748">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> for free, although it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-upgrade-process-is-mildly-confusing-for-nso-members/1100-6532137/" data-ref-id="1100-6532137">may not be immediately clear how</a>.</p><p>A base Nintendo Switch Online subscription runs for $20 a year, while the Expansion Pack plan costs $50 a year. Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p><p>Another perk of the Switch Online service is Switch 2's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-gamechat/1100-6531425/" data-ref-id="1100-6531425">GameChat</a> function, which allows users to chat and share their screen with friends. The feature is free to try for all Switch 2 owners until March 31, 2026 as part of an open-access trial period, after which point you'll need to have a Switch Online subscription to use it.</p>
