Now, after 15 years, the ending of the original game is revisited in the first teaser for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/darksiders-4/" data-ref-id="5000-638028">Darksiders 4</a>. The announcement video recalls Darksiders' closing moments as War is joined by his fellow Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Death, Fury, and Strife.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eafBknCPcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6eafBknCPcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The sequel was officially unveiled today during THQ Nordic's online preview event. The publisher confirmed that Darksiders 4 will continue the story directly after the first game and allow up to four players to ride together as the Four Horsemen through co-op.</p><p>Darksiders and its sequels take place in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a conflict between Heaven and Hell. War was initially blamed for triggering the apocalypse early, and then given the chance to prove his innocence by searching for the one responsible.</p><p>Death and Fury were respectively featured as the leading characters in Darksiders 2 and Darksiders 3. Then Strife took the lead in the 2019 spin-off title, Darksiders Genesis, which moved away from the series' third-person action in favor of a top-down view.</p><p>Darksiders 4 will return to the franchise's third-person perspective, and THQ Nordic states that it will have "cinematic" action that is "fast-paced" and "visceral," with melee and supernatural abilities at players' disposal.</p><p>THQ Nordic hasn't set a date for Darksiders 4 yet, but it will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is just around the corner, promising more looter shooter shenanigans than ever before with its seamless open world design and exciting new traversal methods. There's a ton to look forward to when the game lands on September 12, and it's certain to keep you busy for many months beyond. But what if your friends are picking the game up on a platform you don't have? And what if you want to carry your saves between different ecosystems? We've got the answers about Borderlands 4's cross-play and cross-progression below.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-play?</h2><p>If you have friends playing on different platforms, we've got some good news for you. Borderlands 4 supports cross-play functionality across every platform, letting you team up with any of your pals for some lootin' and shootin'.</p><p>Before you can begin playing with anyone on another platform, however, you'll need to <a href="https://shift.gearboxsoftware.com/home" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up for a SHiFT account</a>. This is a "Gearbox account," for all intents and purposes. Without one, you'll be limited to playing with players who own the game on your platform.</p><p>A SHiFT account has other benefits beyond just cross-play functionality, though. It also allows you to redeem SHiFT codes for special in-game items in the Borderlands series. These codes are often shared during various promotions on social media and beyond, so keep an eye out for them.</p><h2>Does Borderlands 4 have cross-progression?</h2><p>As for cross-progression, nothing has been shared about Borderlands 4's cross-save features quite yet. The franchise's two most recent games, Borderlands 3 and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands, did not feature cross-save functionality. So, it would certainly be nice to finally be able to carry save data between different platforms--but we'll have to wait and see if Gearbox goes all-in on this feature. Even if they do, though, it's important to remember that you'd need to purchase the game on every platform you want to move saves between.</p><p>Borderlands 4 launches September 12 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC, with a Nintendo Switch 2 version following a few weeks later on October 3.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">GOG launched a new website Friday where users can claim 13 games that have been delisted from other online sales portals for free. In a press release, GOG wrote that with the giveaway, it and the game publishers taking part are "taking a stand against the quiet erasure of creative works from digital shelves."</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's giveaway--found at the URL <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FreedomToBuy.games</a>, makes the games available for free to users for the next 48 hours. The titles are mostly sexually explicit and were recently delisted from other digital purchasing sites. GOG's site also includes an email link for developers or publishers interested in offering their games for free "as part of the protest."</p><p dir="ltr">"As an archival platform dedicated to protecting gaming history, we believe that if a game is legal and responsibly made, players should be able to enjoy it today--and decades from now," GOG wrote in a press release about the giveaway.</p><p dir="ltr">"We launched FreedomToBuy.games to make a statement: when games are delisted today because of discomfort, reviving them tomorrow becomes exponentially harder," it continued.</p><p dir="ltr">Sexually explicit games became the focus of controversy in July when thousands were abruptly removed from online game storefronts Steam and <a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow ">Itch.io</a>. Those removals were the result of pressure on the storefronts from payment processors like Mastercard and Visa to remove games featuring sexual content.</p><p dir="ltr">Payment processors were in turn pressured by a campaign by conservative anti-porn organization Collective Shout, which released an <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors" rel="nofollow ">open letter to payment processors on July 11</a>. The organization said it targeted the removal of games about "rape, incest, and child sexual abuse, and asked its members to <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed" rel="nofollow ">call and send emails to payment processors</a>. As <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/gamers-are-furious-about-the-censorship-of-nsfw-games-and-theyre-fighting-back/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wired reported</a>, experts call this tactic "financial censorship," using financial institutions to sidestep platform rules by risking a seller's ability to do business at all. As a result of the campaign, hundreds of games were removed from Steam and, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/itchio-steam-collective-shout-sex-games-consume-me" rel="nofollow ">GameFile</a>, more than 20,000 games marked "not safe for work" were removed from Itch. (Itch released a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content" rel="nofollow ">statement</a> regarding the situation and has begun <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">re-listing some NSFW games</a> if developers choose to make them available for free.)</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253" data-ratio="0.43043295502312" data-width="2379" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4542253"></a><figcaption>freedomtoplay.games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4542253-goggiveaway2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backlash to the delisting began immediately, as many developers and players saw the situation as payment processors dictating to adults what content they were allowed to buy and play. Many developers also said that their games were caught up in the delisting sweep not because they contained pornographic content, but because they focused on LGBTQ elements and themes, or dealt with tough topics like sexual abuse.</p><p dir="ltr">Players and developers have taken to social media to put pressure of their own on payment processors to push against what they see as censorship. The International Game Developers Association released a <a href="https://igda.org/news-archive/press-release-statement-on-game-delistings/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> where it called for "clear rules, fair warnings, and the right to appeal" in this and similar situations, and directed developers to contact Visa and Mastercard directly, and to petitions from the <a href="https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">American Civil Liberties Union</a> and <a href="https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Change.org</a> pushing back on censorship from payment processors.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mastercard-responds-to-censorship-allegations-after-forcing-storefronts-to-remove-adult-games/1100-6533641/">Both Mastercard and Visa have issued statements</a> saying the companies do not make moral judgments about merchandise sold by partners, and both suggested there was an issue of potential illegality at the heart of the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">"Mastercard has not evaluated any game or required restrictions of any activity on game creator sites and platforms, contrary to media reports and allegations," <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/us/en/news-and-trends/press/2025/august/clarifying-recent-headlines-on-gaming-content.html" rel="nofollow ">the company said</a>. "Our payment network follows standards based on the rule of law. Put simply, we allow all lawful purchases on our network. At the same time, we require merchants to have appropriate controls to ensure Mastercard cards cannot be used for unlawful purchases, including illegal adult content."</p><p dir="ltr">Visa made a similar statement to Polygon, saying it requires "enhanced safeguards" for merchants facing "an elevated risk of illegal activity."</p><p dir="ltr">"We do not make moral judgments on legal purchases made by consumers," the statement said. "Visa does not moderate content sold by merchants, nor do we have visibility into the specific goods or services sold when we process a transaction. When a legally operating merchant faces an elevated risk of illegal activity, we require enhanced safeguards for the banks supporting those merchants."</p><p dir="ltr">No claims of potential illegality have been made about any games removed from platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">GOG's FreedomToBuy.games website leads with a statement that could be seen as addressing the legality argument.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some games vanish. Not because they broke the law but because someone decided they shouldn’t exist," the site reads. "For 48 hours, these games are free, because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it."</p>
