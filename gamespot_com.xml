Treyarch has released the cinematic intro trailer for the brand-new Zombies map, which takes the characters to a floating rock in space as the fight for their souls continues.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2UJyX4BSVo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/F2UJyX4BSVo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Following the events of Ashes of the Damned, the characters must continue their search for the powerful Dark Aether creatures being controlled by the Warden, as they work to free the Shadowsmiths and regain their souls.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown in the trailer above, this cinematic for Astra Malorum has the Entity spitting the characters out into space, or at the very least, they're in the Dark Aether version of space.

Directed mode also arrives sometime during the season, which will allow players to have assistance with completing the Ashes of the Damned story quest.</p><p dir="ltr">Make sure to check out our guides for Ashes of the Damned, including how to build the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-7-zombies-wonder-weapon-how-to-get-the-necrofluid-gauntlet-in-ashes-of-the-damned/2900-7261/#1">Necrofluid Gauntlet Wonder Weapon</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-repair-and-upgrade-ol-tessie/1100-6536336/">fully upgrade Ol' Tessie</a>, and complete the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/black-ops-7-zombies-how-to-unlock-the-ashes-of-the-damned-easter-egg-song/2900-7260/">hidden song Easter egg</a>.</p><p>Treyarch has revealed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-aim-assist-changes-and-weapon-balancing-are-coming-in-season-1-update/1100-6536402/">major changes coming to Black Ops 7</a> for Season 1, including a tweak to aim-assist, weapon balancing, and spawn adjustments. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional multiplayer maps, and more.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s new California Resistance update is out now, adding a range of new things for players to experience, including a brand-new map, Eastwood. The map is hiding a Breaking Bad Easter Egg, players have discovered, and it's one of the best-known Breaking Bad references from the show.</p><p>One of the buildings on the new Eastwood map has a pizza on the roof of its garage--this is pretty clearly a reference to the show's 2010 Season 3, Episode 2 episode, "Caballo sin Nombre." In this episode, Walter (Bryan Cranston) tosses an entire pizza onto the roof in a fit of rage. Now, you can see that pizza in Battlefield 6, or something like it.</p><p>This scene became an internet meme, and other games, like High on Life, have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingDetails/comments/10bxubi/the_house_in_high_on_life_has_an_unsliced_pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">referenced it as well.</a></p><p>There is some fantastic lore surrounding the pizza-throwing scene in Breaking Bad. Writer Peter Gould <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4VO7HxpkaE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recalled</a> how difficult he imagined the scene was to film, as Cranston was asked to throw the pizza box, have the pizza separate, and then have the pizza land in the right spot for the shot.</p><p>As it turned out, Cranston nailed it on the first take, something that Gould said was extremely unlikely. Series creator Vince Gilligan commented on it as well. "It was just one of those perfect moments where it looked like it was too perfect to be real, but in fact it was," he said.</p><p>Given the popularity of the scene, and because it was filmed on location at a local Albuquerque resident's home, fans of the show flocked to the location and tried the feat out for themselves. This upset the locals, and Gilligan himself had to <a href="https://time.com/3740595/breaking-bad-vince-gilligan-pizza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">issue a statement to fans asking them to please not do that.</a> The house went up for sale earlier this year, asking just under $4 million, <a href="https://www.realtor.com/news/unique-homes/breaking-bad-house-sale-walter-white/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a huge premium of 10X its estimated value.</a> The house has not sold yet, <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3828-Piermont-Dr-NE-Albuquerque-NM-87111/6776276_zpid/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Zillow records.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg6dxhJbq78" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="123">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Bg6dxhJbq78?start=123" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For Gilligan's new Albuquerque-set show, Pluribus, his team <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/pluribus-vince-gilligan-rhea-seehorn-1236414569/?utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">built an entire cul-de-sac of houses</a> to help avoid another similar tourist attraction situation for people hoping to visit where the main character lives.</p><p>As for Battlefield 6, the new California Resistance update for Season 1 adds the Eastwood map and the Sabotage mode. There are also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-california-resistance-event-pass-all-free-and-paid-rewards-to-unlock/2900-7264/" data-ref-id="2900-7264">new rewards to unlock in the event pass, including free and paid DLC. </a></p><p>New US sales data from Circana showed that Battlefield 6 was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">No. 1 best-selling game for October and for 2025 so far</a>. The game's first-month sales <a href="https://google.com/search?q=battlefield+6+sales+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=battlefield+6+sales+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg8MgYIAhBFGDwyBggDEEUYQDIGCAQQRRhAMgYIBRBFGEDSAQg4OTgzajBqNKgCALACAA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed similar first-month sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. </a></p>

But the new protagonist will come across other returning characters from the franchise, too, according to producer Masato Kumazawa. However, the developer wants to manage expectations, as rumors mount about Resident Evil 2 and 4 protagonist Leon Kennedy appearing in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" rel="nofollow ">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>), Kumazawa was asked about more Resident Evil Outbreak characters popping up in Requiem. "I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don't over-expect or hype it," the producer said. "We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem (RE9) - Official 2nd Trailer</p>

<p dir="ltr">Leon starred alongside Claire Redfield in Resident Evil 2, which was set in Raccoon City. So he definitely fits the criteria teased by Kumazawa. On the flip side, Capcom explained <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/">why Leon was a "bad match" for Resident Evil Requiem</a> earlier this year. The caveat and wiggle room here for Capcom is that Leon was discussed as the protagonist in this light, meaning that he could still show up as an NPC. That said, Kumuzawa is clearly trying to temper expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Kumuzawa opened up about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-abandoned-multiplayer-vision-because-it-wasnt-scary-enough/1100-6536283/">Resident Evil Requiem originally being developed as an online open-world multiplayer game</a>. While this version "was fun to play," Kumuzawa admitted it "wasn't scary enough."</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-may-be-the-most-extreme-in-the-series-says-director/1100-6534329/">Resident Evil will be "an incredible rollercoaster" for players</a>. The survival-horror game is set to launch February 27 on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-scares-its-way-onto-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6534701/">and Switch 2</a>.</p>
